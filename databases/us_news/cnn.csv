"Climate change is shrinking species, study warns","New study warns on impact of shrinking plant and animal speciesFossil data, experiments and research conclude that shrinkage happens during warming periodsCold-blooded animals most affected, but impacts felt by warm-blooded animals tooPlant species also display ""negative correlations between growth and temperature"" Climate change is shrinking many plant and animal species and is likely to have a negative impact on human nutrition in the future, according to a new study. Rising temperatures and growing variability in rainfall are affecting the size of all species in the ecosystem from microscopic sea organisms to land-based predators, say researchers. Our study suggests that ectotherms (cold-blooded animals like toads, turtles, and snakes that rely on environmental heat sources) are already changing a lot, said David Bickford from the National University of Singapore and co-author of the study. Both aquatic and terrestrial ectotherms have been shrinking, according to the study, with common toads size and condition decreasing as temperatures rose 1.5 degrees Celsius over a 22-year period. The study, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, draws on evidence from fossil records, experimental and comparative studies, as well as research implicating anthropogenic climate change over the last 100 years. What was most surprising to me was that it was such a uniform signal across all these different organisms, Bickford said. Fossils from a warming phase during the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (around 55 million years ago) reveal that burrowing invertebrates such as beetles, bees and ants shrank in size by up to 75%. Other fossil records indicated that animals including pocket gophers, woodrats and California squirrels, also shrank during past warming periods, say researchers. Experimental studies which increased water acidification  an observed effect of rising atmospheric carbon dioxide levels  revealed marine species like corals, scallops and oysters become smaller. Each degree of warming has been shown to decrease the size of marine invertebrates by up to 4%, salamanders up to 14% and fish by up to a maximum of 22%, according to the study. But perhaps most worrying for marine life was the reduced growth rates of phytoplankton in response to acidification which could negatively affect all ocean life because (it) forms the basis of the marine food web. Researchers also say plants, which were generally expected to get larger as CO2 levels rise, are not immune from reductions. Over the past century, various plant species have shown significant negative correlations between growth and temperature...resulting in smaller grasses, annual plants and trees in areas that are getting warmer and drier, according to the study. The study cites experiments manipulating temperature showing biomass in some grass, grain and fruit plants was 3-17% smaller for every degree Celsius of warming. But there are exceptions to the trend. Recent studies have indicated that the common lizard, mallard and teal ducks, otters and some birds are increasing in body size, say researchers, but many of these inhabit high latitudes which have witnessed increased growing seasons associated with global warming making patterns of shrinking less common. However, this might be short-lived if climate change increases in severity, according to the study. Average global temperatures rose by nearly one degree Celsius over the past 100 years, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), but worst-case scenarios predict warming of up to seven degrees Celsius by 2100. The studys authors concede many factors will play their part in the size of organisms if warming trends continue, but highlight reduced availability of water and lower levels of soil nutrients as key factors for plants, and the animals that feed off them. Bickford says more experiments need to be done to find out which mechanisms are important to different organisms in different places. And scientists also need to discover how ecological balances are going to be disrupted in the future and what this will mean for different species up and down the food chain, he says. What we might see is that there are many ecological buffers out there. These systems are incredibly resilient. Nature has an amazing adaptive capacity, Bickford said. But shrinking trends in the ecosystem are likely to impact heavily on humans, say the authors. The study points out that nearly one billion people rely on fish as their main source of protein, and increasing variability in rain will make crop cultivation more difficult in many areas in the future. Weve probably got such diverse food source system out there already that its going to a long time before it affects richer countries certainly. But it might not be so long for poorer countries unfortunately, Bickford said.",17/10/2011,https://edition.cnn.com/2011/10/17/world/asia/shrinking-species-global-warming/index.html
How climate change has affected your favorite landscapes,"World leaders have been at the COP17 climate conferenceYou sent us photos of your favorite local landscapesiReporters told us why those landscapes must be protected from climate changeMany of you said there were signs that climate change was already taking its toll This week, world leaders have been at the United Nations Climate Change conference in Durban, South Africa, to discuss climate change. While climate change is predicted to get worse, it is not a hypothetical problem that will occur in the distant future. The U.N. recently said it is confident that increased greenhouse gas emissions have already increased maximum global temperatures. In some areas of the world, climate change has begun to threaten natural habitats, such as the village of Shishmaref, Alaska, where rising temperatures have been melting away ice on the coast, threatening wildlife and livelihoods. We asked you to send us photographs of your favorite local landscape, telling us what that place means to you and why protecting it from climate change is so important. You sent us images of lakes, parks, mountains and waterfalls, from Indonesia to Austria, and New Zealand to the United States. Many of you said there were signs that climate change was already taking its toll, and that action must be taken to protect these special locations. Michael Goodling sent a picture of zebras at the Mlilwane Game Reserve, in Ezulwini, Swaziland  a country he says has been hit by late seasonal rains. Water holes that should be filling for the animals are just thick dry mud, he said. If climate change continues to affect Africa it will also change migratory patterns due to food availability. This applies to humans as well. Without the rains, crops will also be later. He added: I worry that the next generation will not enjoy the zebra, elephants, giraffes, wildebeest, impala, etc. that I am enjoying now. We must act fast to protect these beautiful creatures, the beautiful children and the vast pristine landscape of this amazing continent. See more of the amazing photos you sent us.",03/12/2011,https://edition.cnn.com/2011/12/03/world/ireport-landscape-climate-change/index.html
"NASA scientist links climate change, extreme weather","James Hansen argues that rising global temperatures are fueling an increase in extreme weatherHe cites a 2010 heat wave in Russia and last year's Texas drought as examplesHansen, an activist, directs research at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies What do the 2010 heat wave in Russia, last years Texas drought, and the 2003 heat wave in Europe have in common? All are examples of extreme weather caused by climate change, according to a new study from NASA scientist James Hansen. This is not a climate model or a prediction but actual observations of weather events and temperatures that have happened, he wrote in a Washington Post opinion piece meant to accompany the study. Our analysis shows that it is no longer enough to say that global warming will increase the likelihood of extreme weather and to repeat the caveat that no individual weather event can be directly linked to climate change. To the contrary, our analysis shows that, for the extreme hot weather of the recent past, there is virtually no explanation other than climate change. The study, which was published by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, looks at the past six decades of global temperatures and finds what Hansen described as a stunning rise in the frequency of extremely hot summers. It compared what is happening now to what was happening between 1951-1980. In those years, extremely hot temperatures covered less than 0.2% of the planet. Now, those temperatures cover about 10% of the land area, the study said. It dismissed the idea that specific weather patterns are by themselves sufficient to explain todays extreme anomalies. Phenomena like La Nina have always been around, but large areas of extreme warming have only come about with climate change, the study said. The odds that natural variability created these extremes are minuscule, vanishingly small. To count on those odds would be like quitting your job and playing the lottery every morning to pay the bills, wrote Hansen. Hansen directs research at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York and is a longtime environmental activist.",05/08/2012,https://edition.cnn.com/2012/08/05/us/climate-change/index.html
Climate change is real,"Chris Field: Superstorm Sandy gave the Eastern seaboard a poundingHe says rising sea level has greatly complicated problem of protecting coastlineStorm tracks outside tropics moving further from the equator, he saysField: One key to disaster planning may be that the future won't look like the past Hurricane Sandy gave the Eastern seaboard a real pounding this week, with heavy rain, widespread flooding and high winds. In addition to damage from water and wind, the East Coast is experiencing cascading effects of power outages and disrupted transportation systems. Downed power lines have led to fires and electrocutions. Widespread shutdowns of government and business operations are curtailing economic activity. More than 50 lives have been lost. It is too early to get an estimate of damages, but the economic costs will likely amount to billions or perhaps tens of billions of dollars. The element of risk is epitomized by the disabled boom of a construction crane, dangling 80 stories over the streets of Manhattan, an all-too-real sword of Damocles. Many of the areas buffeted by Sandy were hit by Hurricane Irene in August of 2011. What is going on? Is the punch from Sandy or the one-two pounding from Irene and then Sandy a consequence of climate change or an unlucky roll of the climate dice? The evidence is not yet in for the East Coast in 2011 and 2012, but the general trends are increasingly clear. In its 2012 report on managing the risks of extreme events and disasters, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that A changing climate leads to changes in the frequency, intensity, spatial extent, duration, and timing of extreme weather and climate events, and can result in unprecedented extreme weather and climate events. Many observations and many lines of evidence support this conclusion. Yet, the fact that hurricanes and other climate extremes occur only rarely means that it is very difficult to know for sure that the recent pattern is really outside the range of historical variation. Globally, we dont have conclusive evidence that hurricanes are increasing, but we do see a clear indication that the major storm tracks outside the tropics are moving further from the equator. From the perspective of expected damages, two trends highlight causes for concern. First, economic losses from weather-related disasters have increased over the last several decades. This is mostly because of increases in the value of the assets in harms way. Second, sea level is rising. Globally, sea level is now about 6 inches higher than in 1900. This may not sound like much, but a modest change can have big effects. Flooding from storm surge is a classic threshold event. If the waves are 1 inch below the top of the sea wall, there is no damage. One inch above leads to flooding. This combination of increasing exposure and increasing sea level is gradually notching up the level of risk. What can be done? For disaster managers, the long-standing foundations for effectiveness are preparation, response, and recovery. So far, disaster management agencies, from the local to the national level, have taken Sandy very seriously, appropriate for a storm of its magnitude. The tradition in disaster management has been to base planning on past experiences. Thats a reasonable approach when the future looks basically like the past. But it is a recipe for regret when climate and development are changing. Much can be done to incorporate new knowledge into disaster management, including steps to reduce the risks of future disasters. One key is recognizing that the future wont be like the past. To cope with changes in climate, development and population, we should be building climate and sea level projections into infrastructure planning, building codes and plans for managing disasters. We have the scientific knowledge and engineering knowledge to improve all three phases of disaster risk reduction  preparation, response and recovery. But we dont know everything. As a consequence, it is important to make learning by doing an integral part of disaster management. We need to continue to refine our understanding of the role of climate change in altering the risks, at the same time we test technologies and strategies for dealing with a future that we know will be different from the past. Climate change is occurring now. We see its consequences in hotter temperatures, higher sea levels and shifted storm tracks. In many parts of the world, we are also seeing an increase in the fraction of rainfall that comes in the heaviest events. When it rains, increasingly it pours. Climate change over the next couple of decades is already largely baked into the system, but changes beyond that are mostly in our hands. As we learn more about the links between climate change and extreme events, it will benefit all of us to think hard about the opportunities and challenges of getting a handle on climate change, so we control it and not vice versa.

Quicker fix for climate change,"Tseming Yang: Result of Doha climate change conference less than desirableYang: It's time to abandon the myth that a consensus solution is the best approach He says the 25 major carbon emitters should work out an agreement among themselvesYang: Smaller, focused discussions may be better than large, U.N.-style gatherings The Doha climate change conference this year was the most significant in nearly 20 years of gatherings under the U.N. Framework Convention process aimed at staving off future global warming disaster. Since carbon dioxide emission limits agreed to under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol were to expire at the stroke of midnight on December 31, 2012, it was critical that the international community agreed to extend those obligations and to continue talks about future emission cuts. But the outcome fell far short of what will be necessary to keep the worlds average temperature from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius in the foreseeable future. Under the Doha arrangement, 17 of the 25 biggest carbon emitting countries (including China, the United States, Russia and India) did not commit to any legally binding emission limits. The countries that did agree to extend and deepen their Kyoto emission reductions, including the European Union, Australia and Eastern Europe, make up only about 15% of the worlds emissions. That seems like a rather meager return on the investment of time and effort over the past years. But there is one silver lining. The worlds top 20 carbon emitters together make up about 77% of emission and account for about 4.3 billion people, which is about 62% of the global population. The remaining 170 or so countries account for just over 20% of emissions. As often is the case, these negotiations over climate have come to symbolize epic David and Goliath struggles pitting poor developing countries against recalcitrant government officials from rich countries. Lobbying efforts, shaming tactics, and staging public demonstrations have been the slingshots of choice. One result is that more people are paying attention to environmental issues. Nonetheless, it is time to abandon the myth that a consensus solution is necessarily the best approach. The unfortunate reality is that little can get done right now. Its like having hundreds of cooks with hundreds of different recipes attempting to prepare one meal in the same small kitchen. After two decades of hard work, it is time to consider reducing the number of cooks. A better alternative to a United Nations-style conference would be for the 25 major emitters to come to an agreement just among themselves about their mutual commitments to deal with climate change effectively. In other words, get the 25 cooks to work together on the main meal. The hundreds of other cooks ought to step out of the kitchen. Some smaller, focused discussions have already started, such as in the Major Economies Forum. Imagine what kind of deals on cutting emissions would be possible just among China, India and the United States  the top three emitters in the world respectively. Imagine a deal involving emission sources in China, which has some of the worlds most polluting coal-fired power plants, and California, which is on a course to become one of the most stringently controlled states in carbon emissions. Of course, there are no guarantees for success. But discussions within such a smaller group would allow government leaders to confront the realities of climate change and engage in direct horse-trading without the static of thousands of other voices desiring to load their issues into the deal. Lets face it  we are way beyond the time for finding an ideal solution. Every year the world waits to take further concrete steps to cut emissions, the atmosphere will be loaded with millions of tons more carbon dioxide that will stay for a century. And the job of limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius will be more out of reach. At the best, gatherings like the one in Doha dangle a tantalizing mirage of achieving a sustainable future. At the worst, they give cover to governments that would rather avoid the hard choices they ultimately will have to make. After one more expensive and time-consuming round of talks, its time to be honest with what can really be accomplished in these U.N.-style gatherings.

Climate change: U.N. summary of latest science coming Friday,"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a report every five or six yearsA draft that leaked in August said there is more certainty that humans are playing a roleThe report will lay out projections for climate change through the end of the centuryThe first section of the report is aimed at assisting policymakers How much of a role do humans play in climate change? A new report scheduled to come out on Friday will give scientists latest take on the topic. The United Nations report is expected to contain language that further identifies the role human activity is playing in increasing global temperatures through burning of fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions. The last report, in 2007, indicated that it was very likely that humans were responsible for most of the observed warming  a judgment that corresponds to a confidence level greater than 90%. A draft that leaked in August raised that confidence level to extremely likely, or greater than 95% confidence that humans are responsible for the majority of global warming through carbon pollution. The impacts of this warming are already being seen through increases in extreme weather events such as heat waves, droughts and extreme flooding events, which the assessment will highlight. The report will lay out projections for climate change through the end of the century, based upon four different carbon emission scenarios. Those range from a low end which would require significant cutbacks in emissions, to a worst-case scenario in which carbon emissions would continue to climb unabated. The projections will provide more details about sea-level rise, for which observations show rates increasing, and should give a more precise estimate of the levels we will see at the end of the century. Loss of sea ice will also be addressed, and the report will discuss the accelerating loss of sea ice in the Arctic and the slight increase of ice seen in the Antarctic. Hundreds of experts weigh in The 2013 assessment report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change brings together the latest research from top scientists in the field. It contains a summary for policymakers aimed at guiding politicians and lawmakers worldwide on decisions regarding the environment over the next several years. The U.N. panel releases a report every five or six years. Fridays report is the culmination of work by more than 250 authors from 39 countries and was subject to an extensive review process involving more than 1,000 experts. More than 850 expert authors from 85 countries contributed research for the full report, which will be released in three stages through April. The first, on the physical science behind climate change, accompanies the summary for policymakers. The second, expected in March, will cover impacts and vulnerabilities of climate change; the third, on mitigation efforts, is set to go out in April. Bloomberg: Why Sandy forced cities to take lead on climate change Climate change may increase violence, study shows Critics of the report Despite the breadth of the scientific expertise involved and the extensive review and approval process, the assessment reports spark quite a few criticisms, from both climate change believers and skeptics. Skeptics say the panel exists only to produce further evidence supporting the idea of man-made climate change while ignoring opposing research. But climate change activists, and many climate scientists, say the panels consensus-seeking policy produces conclusions and estimates that are too conservative. Another often-cited critique of the report is that, due to its size and lengthy approval process, it is already outdated by the time it is released. Several important studies already have been published in the past year in the constantly evolving science of climate change that will not be included in this assessment. Despite the critics, this weeks document will serve as a major measuring stick for the current state of the worlds climate and what type of change is in store. The summary for policymakers will be available Friday at www.climatechange2013.org.

U.N. climate change report points blame at humans,"Scientists surer than ever humans play major role in climate change, report saysGlobal warming already affecting extreme weather, and it could get worse, report saysU.N.'s IPCC convenes every six years to put together report; it's considered benchmark on topicEven if emissions ended today, effects of climate change could linger for centuries The worlds getting hotter, the seas rising and theres increasing evidence neither are naturally occurring phenomena. So says a report from the U.N. International Panel on Climate Change, a document released every six years that is considered the benchmark on the topic. More than 800 authors and 50 editors from dozens of countries took part in its creation. The summary for policymakers was released early Friday, while the full report, which bills itself as a comprehensive assessment of the physical science basis of climate change, will be distributed Monday. Other reports, including those dealing with vulnerability and mitigation, will be released next year. Here are the highlights from Fridays summary: Man-made climate change is almost certain Climate scientists are 95% confident  that is to say, surer than ever  that humans are responsible for at least half of the observed increase in global average surface temperatures since the 1950s. This is the major headline from the report, as it marks a stark spike in confidence over the last 12 years, as scientists were 90% confident in 2007 and 66% confident in 2001 of the same conclusion. An increase in carbon dioxide concentrations that is unprecedented in the last 20,000 years, along with increases in other emissions, have driven up average temperatures by about 0.6 degrees Celsius (1 degree Fahrenheit) since 1950, the report states. Worst-case predictions are that by 2100, temperatures could increase by as much as 3.7 degrees Celsius (6.6 Fahrenheit), the report says. Climate change is already affecting extreme weather Since 1950 weve seen a dramatic increase in extreme weather. This is especially true of record heat and heavier precipitation events. While its difficult to determine the exact role climate change plays in an individual event, such as Hurricane Sandy or the EF-5 tornado that struck Moore, Oklahoma, because there are so many ingredients necessary to brew a single storm, the links are clearer when you look at overall patterns. According to a study released this month in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, scientists found strong links between global warming and extreme weather around the globe in 2012. Among the 2012 events were the July heat wave in the northeastern and north-central United States, the spring heat wave in the eastern United States, the Great Plains drought, the winter drought in Spain and Portugal and the heavy rains and flooding in Europe. According to a paper in the journal Nature, this year, weather events that have previously been classified as storms of the century could become the storm of every 20 years or less. Climate change will probably increase storm intensity and size simultaneously, resulting in a significant intensification of storm surges, the paper said. The last 30-year period is very likely the warmest in the last 800 years Scientists are 90% sure that 1981-2010 was the warmest such span in the last eight centuries, and theres a 66% chance that it was the warmest 30-year period in the last 1,400 years. While the last 15 years have not warmed as quickly, weve seen steady warming over most of the globe, and we havent seen a below-average temperature month since February 1985. Scientists are also 99% certain that we will see more hot days and nights  and fewer chilly ones  as the 21st century progresses. Each of the last three decades has been significantly warmer than all preceding decades since 1850, according to the IPCC report. To give you an idea of how the Earth has heated up, the combined land and ocean temperature increased by about 0.8 degrees Celsius between 1901 and 2010, yet between 1979 and 2010, the temperature spiked about 0.5 degrees Celsius. Sea level rise will increase due to warming oceans and loss of ice Better climate models give scientists more confidence that sea level rise will accelerate in the 21st century. Scientists are 99% sure that sea level rise has accelerated over the last 2 centuries at a rate higher than at any time in the last 2,000 years. Theyre also highly confident that if the global surface temperature increases by more than 2 degrees Celsius over present temperatures we could see a nearly ice-free Arctic Ocean in late summer. The report further notes that there is increasing evidence that ice sheets are losing mass, glaciers are shrinking, Arctic sea ice cover is diminishing, snow cover is decreasing and permafrost is thawing in the Northern Hemisphere. As for the rise in sea level, scientists asserted in the IPCC report that tide gauges and satellite data make it unequivocal that the worlds mean sea level is on the upswing. Even if we end emission tomorrow, climate change could continue for centuries This may be one of the more harrowing findings in the report, as it suggests were too far gone to effect any meaningful change in our lifetimes. Even if we end carbon dioxide emissions today, effects could linger for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. And certain changes may already be irreversible. Many aspects of climate change will persist for centuries even if concentrations of greenhouse gases are stabilized. This represents a multicentury commitment created by human activities today, the report states.",27/09/2013,https://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/27/world/climate-change-5-things/index.html
Climate change report: It? ?xtremely likely?that humans are responsible,"Climate change deniers beware, says Secretary of State John KerryThere is even more certainty that humans are playing a roleThe report lays out projections for climate change through the end of the centuryThe first section of the report is aimed at assisting policymakers Human activity has caused at least half of climate change in the last half-century, hundreds of scientists say. They are 95% certain of this, the surest theyve ever been, says a United Nations report published Friday. That activity? Driving cars, running power plants on coal and oil, torching swathes of forestland and debris; anything involving burning carbon-based fuels and emitting greenhouse gases. We are seeing the consequences already in extreme weather patterns, particularly drought and flood, and they will probably get worse this century, the report said. It should serve as yet another wake-up call our activities today have a profound impact on society, not only for us, but for many generations to come, Michel Jarraud, head of the World Meteorological Organization, said at a news conference in Stockholm, Sweden. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry echoed his words in an official statement. Those who deny the science or choose excuses over action are playing with fire, he said. Once again, the science grows clearer, the case grows more compelling, and the costs of inaction grow beyond anything that anyone with conscience or common sense should be willing to even contemplate. Beneath Greenlands ice, a grand canyon The assessment report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is the benchmark study on global warming published every few years. Nearly 1,000 researchers from around the world work on the document, which then undergoes review by about as many scientists. The panel released a summary report Friday and plans to post the full version, roughly 2,500 pages, online on Monday. This years report further strengthens the suspicions that scientists already have. In 2007, climate researchers were already 90% sure that people were behind a seemingly small rise in global average temperature of about half a degree Celsius (1 degree Fahrenheit) that has already notched up extreme weather events such as heat waves, droughts and flooding. While 90% constitutes a very likely degree of certainty, Fridays report stating scientists are now 95% sure indicates an extremely likely degree of certainty, which is considered the gold standard when discussing probability. The effects humans are already causing are expected to increase for a century or more, the report reads. Weather catastrophes, previously called storms of the century, are on their way to striking every 20 years or even more frequently. Bloomberg: Why Sandy forced cities to take lead on climate change This means, unfortunately, that we could see more EF5 tornadoes like the one that ground up Moore, Oklahoma; stronger and more floods like those that inundated Colorado towns; another Sandy or Katrina or two in our lifetimes; more crops wiped out by drought; and more forestland consumed by roaring wildfires. The Arctic ice cap could melt nearly completely in summer, and sea levels could continue to rise. In the Antarctic, the ice cap could continue to increase slightly. And if greenhouse gas emissions continue to climb as they have, the resulting temperature rise and its deadly effects would get even worse, the report says.

"Climate change to drive annual temps to new highs within a generation, study says","A new study sets dates when average temperatures will exceed current recordsSome cities in the tropics will hit the milestone by 2020, the study saysBy 2100, average temps will be higher than any time since at least 1860, study saysLimiting emissions will slow down but not stop the changes, authors say Average annual temperatures will start to consistently exceed the highest levels previously recorded in as little as seven years in tropical hotspots and within four decades for the majority of the globe if nothing is done to stop climate change, according to a new study published Thursday in the journal Nature. And by the end of the century, monthly average temperatures will be higher than at any time since at least 1860, according to the study, led by University of Hawaii geographer Camilo Mora. The effects will be felt first in tropical climates, with the annual temperature range rising beyond the historical range in Manokwari, Indonesia, in 2020, according to a map that accompanies the study on the University of Hawaii website. Mexico Citys date is 2031. Its 2046 in Orlando, and a year later in Washington and New York, according to the group. Anchorage, Alaska, doesnt climb on board until 2071. The results shocked us. Regardless of the scenario, changes will be coming soon, Mora said in a statement posted by the university. Within my generation, whatever climate we were used to will be a thing of the past. Climate change report: Its extremely likely that humans are responsible According to the research, which assesses the impact of warming using an average of well-accepted computer climate models, the average annual global temperature will move to a state continuously outside the bounds of historical variability in 2047 if no efforts are made to slow global warming. Such changes can be put off some 20 years if greenhouse gas emissions are stabilized, the study says. What exactly does this mean? If you live in the Midwest, think back to the extreme heat and drought of the past few years, CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said. Russian residents can remember the heat in 2010, Europeans, 2003. Well, thats going to be a normal year, not even an extreme, Miller said. Those kinds of extreme become an average. It doesnt mean that every day is going to be a record high, he said. Theres still variability from month to month, day to day. But that overall year is going to be hotter than any of the years weve experienced. Opinion: We need common sense on climate change The study comes two weeks after the release of a United Nations report expressing widespread, rising confidence among scientists the climate is already warming and that humans are responsible for at least half of the increase in global surface temperatures since the 1950s. This work demonstrates that we are pushing the ecosystems of the world out of the environment in which they evolved into wholly new conditions that they may not be able to cope with. Extinctions are likely to result, the University of Hawaii quoted Ken Caldeira of the Carnegie Institution for Sciences Department of Global Ecology as saying. Some ecosystems may be able to adapt, but for others, such as coral reefs, complete loss of not only individual species but their entire integrity is likely. Caldeira was not involved in the study, according to the school. While many places around the world wont see their climate tip outside of historical ranges for many decades, that doesnt mean climate change wont be affecting those places before then, the authors contend. And more immediate, and rapid, changes in the tropics will spell trouble worldwide, they contend. Much of the worlds population lives in tropical climates in countries without sufficient resources to adapt to the changing climate, the authors say. More than 5 billion people live in areas that would be affected by climate change by 2050 should nothing be done to slow its pace, the authors say. A significant portion of the worlds food supply and much of global biodiversity also comes from tropical regions, they say. Our results suggest that countries first impacted by unprecedented climates are the ones with the least capacity to respond, co-author Ryan Longman said in the university statement. Ironically, these are the countries that are least responsible for climate change in the first place. This suggests that any progress to decrease the rate of ongoing climate change will require a bigger commitment from developed countries to decrease their emissions, but will also require more extensive funding of social and conservation programmes in developing countries, the authors write in their study.

Report: Climate change may pose threat to economic growth,"Climate change may be ""serious obstacle"" to sustainable growth in key cities, says reportThe climate change vulnerability index is published by risk analysis firm MaplecroftNearly a third of the world's economy will come from highly or extremely vulnerable places Bangladesh was the most vulnerable country and its capital the most vulnerable city Nearly a third of the worlds economic output will come from countries facing high to extreme risks from the impacts of climate change within 12 years, according to a new report. The Climate Change Vulnerability Index, an annual report produced by UK-based risk analysis firm Maplecroft, found that climate change may pose a serious obstacle to sustainable economic growth in the worlds most commercially important cities. The index ranked the vulnerability of the worlds countries, and the 50 cities deemed most economically important, to the impacts of climate change, by evaluating their risk of exposure to extreme climate events, the sensitivity of their populations to that exposure and the adaptive capacity of governments to respond to the challenge. READ MORE: Australian bushfires inflame climate change debate It said the combined GDP of the 67 countries classed as facing high or extreme risks was projected to nearly triple from $15 trillion to $44 trillion by 2025  meaning nearly a third of the global economy would be coming under increasing threat from extreme climate-related events. It projected the population of those countries  currently estimated at more than 4.5 billion  could exceed 5 billion by 2025. The indexs findings bore particularly bad news for Bangladesh, which topped both lists, with its capital, Dhaka, ranked the most vulnerable city due to its exposure to threats such as flooding, storm surge, cyclones and landslides, its susceptible population and weak institutional capacity to address the problem. Along with the Bangladeshi capital, the four other cities categorized as facing extreme risk from climate change impacts were also located in Asia  Mumbai, Manila, Kolkata and Bangkok  and projected to be centers of high economic growth. The combined GDP in these cities is forecast to almost triple from US$275 billion to US$804 billion by 2025, representing the greatest combined growth in any of the risk categories, said the report, released Wednesday. The figures, it said, underlined the way in which cities with some of the biggest economic growth potential are among those with the greatest vulnerability to climate change. Greenpeaces chief scientist Doug Parr said the report highlighted just how urgent the need is for the international community to tackle climate change. Without a binding global agreement the economic and social impact of global warming will be devastating, he said. It would be morally negligent for countries with large emissions to ignore the mounting evidence of the impact global warming that shows that some of the poorest nations on the planet will be hit hardest, while those nations who are seeing the first signs of economic growth after years of stagnation will see those gains washed away by consequences of global warming. READ MORE: Annual temperatures to reach new highs within a generation On a national level, many global growth markets were extremely vulnerable to climate change, the report said, with important markets such as Nigeria, India, Pakistan, Vietnam and the Philippines all joining Bangladesh in the extreme risk category. Bangladesh was followed on the list of most vulnerable countries by Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone, Haiti, South Sudan, Nigeria, Democratic Republic of Congo, Cambodia, the Philippines and Ethiopia. The vulnerability of many African countries  which accounted for 14 of the 20 most at-risk nations  was partly due to their natural susceptibility to extreme climate-related events such as floods, droughts, fires, storms or landslides. But it was also a consequence of the vulnerability of the population, and the inadequacies of existing infrastructure to adapt to or tackle the problem, due to weak economies, governance, education and healthcare. Countries in south and southeast Asia, which accounted for one-third of all extreme risk nations, were likely to face an increased risk of severe flooding due to projected changes in seasonal rainfall. These would also increase the likelihood of summer droughts, and in turn, declining crop yields. The most susceptible populations in these areas were in areas with high levels of poverty, and where large populations had clustered on marginal land such as flood plains or coastal regions in cyclone-prone areas. READ MORE: Extremely likely humans responsible for climate change While the majority of small, developing, island nations faced extreme levels of exposure to climate-related events, their populations and infrastructures were deemed less sensitive, and were therefore generally not considered to be at extreme risk overall. One exception was Haiti, where poor healthcare access, weak infrastructure, high levels of poverty and an over-reliance on agriculture placed the country into the extreme category. Maplecrofts head of environment, James Allan, said that identifying where the risks of climate change were going to be highest was now an imperative for both business and governments. Framing the risks in economic terms makes the issue harder to ignore, especially for business, and it may prompt better preparedness planning, he said. Nothing prompts corporate or political action faster than having to deal with the aftermath of an extreme climate event. London and Paris were the only two cities ranked as low risk, while Iceland, followed by Norway and Ireland, were the least vulnerable countries. In September, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published its latest assessment report, a benchmark study on global warming involving the efforts of nearly 1,000 researchers around the world. It expressed widespread, rising confidence among scientists the climate is warming, that humans are responsible for at least half of the increase in temperatures since the 1950s.",30/10/2013,https://edition.cnn.com/2013/10/29/world/climate-change-vulnerability-index/index.html
Top climate change scientists?letter to policy influencers,"Four top environmental scientists call on leaders to embrace nuclear powerLetter: ""We understand that today's nuclear plants are far from perfect.""""There is no credible path to climate stabilization that does not include ... nuclear power,"" says letter To those influencing environmental policy but opposed to nuclear power: As climate and energy scientists concerned with global climate change, we are writing to urge you to advocate the development and deployment of safer nuclear energy systems. We appreciate your organizations concern about global warming, and your advocacy of renewable energy. But continued opposition to nuclear power threatens humanitys ability to avoid dangerous climate change. We call on your organization to support the development and deployment of safer nuclear power systems as a practical means of addressing the climate change problem. Global demand for energy is growing rapidly and must continue to grow to provide the needs of developing economies. At the same time, the need to sharply reduce greenhouse gas emissions is becoming ever clearer. We can only increase energy supply while simultaneously reducing greenhouse gas emissions if new power plants turn away from using the atmosphere as a waste dump. Read more about the letter and the controversy surrounding it Renewables like wind and solar and biomass will certainly play roles in a future energy economy, but those energy sources cannot scale up fast enough to deliver cheap and reliable power at the scale the global economy requires. While it may be theoretically possible to stabilize the climate without nuclear power, in the real world there is no credible path to climate stabilization that does not include a substantial role for nuclear power We understand that todays nuclear plants are far from perfect. Fortunately, passive safety systems and other advances can make new plants much safer. And modern nuclear technology can reduce proliferation risks and solve the waste disposal problem by burning current waste and using fuel more efficiently. Innovation and economies of scale can make new power plants even cheaper than existing plants. Regardless of these advantages, nuclear needs to be encouraged based on its societal benefits. Quantitative analyses show that the risks associated with the expanded use of nuclear energy are orders of magnitude smaller than the risks associated with fossil fuels. No energy system is without downsides. We ask only that energy system decisions be based on facts, and not on emotions and biases that do not apply to 21st century nuclear technology. While there will be no single technological silver bullet, the time has come for those who take the threat of global warming seriously to embrace the development and deployment of safer nuclear power systems as one among several technologies that will be essential to any credible effort to develop an energy system that does not rely on using the atmosphere as a waste dump. With the planet warming and carbon dioxide emissions rising faster than ever, we cannot afford to turn away from any technology that has the potential to displace a large fraction of our carbon emissions. Much has changed since the 1970s. The time has come for a fresh approach to nuclear power in the 21st century. We ask you and your organization to demonstrate its real concern about risks from climate damage by calling for the development and deployment of advanced nuclear energy.

U.N. report: Don? delay on climate change,"Climate expert: Cars and coal are big problemsCarbon dioxide changes climate and drives acidification of the oceanEconomic and population growth drive fossil fuel carbon dioxide emissions Procrastinate on tackling a problem and it might get worse, and more expensive. Climate change is no different, a new report says. The longer we wait to mitigate the detrimental levels of carbon dioxide thrown into the atmosphere, the harder its going to be to work against rising temperatures, says a leaked draft report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, obtained by CNN. Its really about cars and coal, said Marilyn Brown, professor of public policy at Georgia Institute of Technology, who was one of the review editors of the report. We need to reduce our reliance on coal power and find a way to transport ourselves and all of the goods we consume more economically, more efficiently. Climate experts have modeled a variety of scenarios of how atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations will affect global temperature changes. If in 2100 the atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are between 430 and 480 parts per million, the global temperature change, as compared to the mid-1800s, will be likely to stay below 2 degrees Celsius, according to a chart in the report. A greater temperature change becomes more likely if carbon dioxide levels exceed 530 ppm by 2100. Already, in 2013, atmospheric carbon dioxide reached a historic high of 400 ppm at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration observatory in Mauna Loa, Hawaii. Delaying mitigation through 2030 will increase the challenges of, and reduce the options for, bringing atmospheric concentration levels to 530 ppm or lower by the end of the century, the report said. Two degrees Celsius may seem tiny, but a U.N. report from September said that a rise of 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of this century could result in a nearly ice-free Arctic Ocean in late summer. Carbon dioxide changes climate and drives acidification of the ocean. Rising temperatures boost sea levels and increase the likelihood of extreme storms. Agriculture, forestry, ecosystems and human health are all expected to suffer as a result of trends in climate change. The September U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report said there is 95% certainty that rising temperatures are due to human activity. U.N. climate change report points blame at humans The newer reports draft is dated December 17, and the wording may change between now and when the finalized report is released from Yokohama, Japan in late March. The two main drivers of increases in fossil fuel carbon dioxide emissions from 2000 to 2010 were economic and population growth, the latest report draft said. Over the same time period, there has been an increased use of coal relative to other energy sources. Heres a U.S. perspective on that: Coal-fired electricity generation represented 37% of total generation in 2012, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Coal use for generating electricity is a big part of why carbon dioxide emissions have nearly doubled their rate of growth worldwide, the report said. The growth rate was 1.3% per year from 1970 to 2000, and 2.2% per year from 2000 to 2010. If there arent explicit efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the drivers of emissions growth are projected to continue, regardless of improvements in energy supply and technology, the report said. Ten countries were responsible for 70% of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes, the report said. Climate experts have come up with models of various scenarios of what would happen at various atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide. Limiting peak atmospheric concentrations over the course of the century  not only reaching long-term concentration levels  is critical for limiting temperature change, the report said. Another problematic piece in the climate change puzzle is fossil fuel subsidies, which provide incentives for people to consume high carbon-dioxide emitting fuels. Brown noted that countries such as Russia, Nigeria, and many Middle Eastern nations sell gasoline and natural gas to citizens at a discount. Worldwide, such subsidies totaled $544 billion in 2012, according to the International Energy Agency. Reduction of subsidies to fossil fuels can achieve significant emission reductions at negative social cost, the draft report said. There are also efforts to incentivize clean energy, however. China is producing cheap solar power technologies because the government subsidizes solar manufacturing companies, Brown said. Many renewable energy technologies have progressed in their performance and cost, and this form of energy is fast-growing, the report said. But in order to increase their market share, such technologies need support. Nuclear energy is low in greenhouse gas emissions, but since 1993 its share of electricity generation worldwide has been declining, the report noted. Concerns about operational safety, security of waste management and proliferation of nuclear weapons are some of the main reasons that nuclear power isnt thriving. New technologies that target some of the concerns are in the works. Another potential tool against fossil fuel emissions are carbon capture and storage technologies, which suck carbon dioxide out of the air and store it, often underground. But as of now, they are quite costly, Brown said. Some countries have implemented carbon taxes; combined with technology and other policies, such efforts have led to a decoupling of carbon emissions from GDP, the report said. The report gives attention to the programs and policies that developing countries can use in particular to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions. Its in the developing world where were seeing such an acceleration of CO2 emissions, Brown said. Our focus needs to address them more directly in the future. Country-specific targets known as the Cancun Pledges include emissions that are too high to keep atmospheric carbon dioxide between 430 and 530 parts per million by 2100, and delay mitigation through 2020, the report said. But delaying until 2030 would be even more costly, economically and in terms of actually making a substantial impact with current technology. The message is clear: Delay more, pay more  or it might be too late.

"John Kerry: Climate change as big a threat as terrorism, poverty, WMDs","Secretary of State John Kerry says climate deniers are supported by shoddy scienceHe says little has been done since the 1990s when scientists first spoke of the problemU.S. giving Indonesia more than $300 million in aid to reduce deforestationKerry says China agrees to framework for discussions on how to deal with climate change Saying that climate change ranks among the worlds most serious problems  such as disease outbreaks, poverty, terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called on all nations to respond to the greatest challenge of our generation. Kerry, speaking before college students in Jakarta, Indonesia, also criticized climate-change deniers, saying a few loud interest groups shouldnt be given the chance to misdirect the conversation. Kerry reiterated U.S. President Barack Obamas assertion in the State of the Union address that climate change is an undeniable fact. We should not allow a tiny minority of shoddy scientists and science and extreme ideologues to compete with scientific fact, Kerry said at the U.S. Embassys @america function in Jakarta. Too many ecosystems such as Indonesias are in peril because of climate change, he said. He said Indonesias important fishing trade would be adversely affected, citing a study that said catches in the island nation will decline by 40 percent. Kerry recalled a meeting in Brazil where many experts described the growing problem caused by climate change. The session was in 1992. Very little has been done sine then, he said. Opinion: Why global health security is a national priority It is time for the world to approach this problem with the cooperation, the urgency, and the commitment that a challenge of this scale warrants, he said. The secretary acknowledged the role the United States plays in greenhouse gas emissions and referred to the Presidents Climate Action Plan, which calls for cutting emissions by 17 percent from 2005 levels. Thats because were going straight to the largest sources of pollution, he said. Kerry said he and Obama had no time for what he called the Flat Earth Society. It will soon be too late for action to prevent the immense costs of doing nothing. People who refuse to look at the evidence and agree on change are burying their heads in the sand, he said. On Friday, Obama toured a California farm hit by serious and prolonged drought. He warned that some damage to the climate had already been done and will continue unless countries do more to combat the carbon pollution that causes climate change. Kerry was fresh off a Saturday meeting in China, the No. 1 producer of greenhouse gas emissions. He said the two nations have agreed to a partnership that will share information and policies so that we can help develop plans to deal with the U.N. climate change negotiation that takes place in Paris next year. But, Kerry added, while industrialized countries produce a majority of emissions, other nations shouldnt get a free pass. He called on Indonesians to push their government to change policies. The United States will help, too, he said. He announced $332 million in funding through the Green Prosperity program to help Indonesia tackle unsustainable deforestation and support clean-energy projects. The United States has also forgiven some of Indonesias debt in a debt-for-nature swap in exchange for forest conservation. The World Wildlife Federation estimates that half of Sumatras forest cover disappeared from 1985 to 2008. The government has halted the cutting of virgin forest, also known as primary forest. With Indonesia and the rest of the world pulling in the same direction, we can meet this challenge, the greatest challenge of our generation, and we can create the future that everybody dreams of, he said.

Why are we still debating climate change?,"97% of scientists say humans are causing climate changeCarol Costello: Why pretend that there's still a debate going on?Politicians, conservative organizations seek to foster denial of the reality, she saysCostello: Lack of trust in scientists is one reason the phony controversy continues There is no debate. Climate change is real. And, yes, we are, in part, to blame. There is a 97% consensus among scientific experts that humans are causing global warming. Ninety-seven percent! Yet some very vocal Americans continue to debate what is surely fact. The question is, why? Trust certainly plays a part. According to Gordon Gauchat, an associate professor of sociology from the University of Wisconsin, just 42% of adults in the U.S. have a great deal of confidence (PDF) in the scientific community. Its easy to understand why. Most Americans cant even name a living scientist. I suspect the closest many Americans get to a living, breathing scientist is the fictional Dr. Sheldon Cooper from CBSs sitcom The Big Bang Theory. Sheldon is brilliant, condescending and narcissistic. Whose trust would he inspire? But trust isnt the only factor in why many Americans doubt climate change. I asked Anthony Leiserowitz, the director of the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication. His group has been studying the why question for more than a decade. Weve found there are six very (specific) categories that respond to this issue in different ways, he said. He calls these categories Global Warmings Six Americas. Opinion: Obamas efforts on climate may not be enough The first group, The Alarmed, is made up 16% of the public. They believe climate change is an urgent problem but have no clear idea of how to fix it. The second group (27%) is The Concerned. They believe climate change is a problem but think its more about polar bears and tiny islands than a problem that directly affects them. The third group, The Cautious (23%), are people on the fence. They havent made up their minds whether global warming is real or if its a man-made problem. The fourth group, The Disengaged (5%), doesnt know anything about climate change. The fifth group, The Doubtful (12%), do not think climate change is man-made. They think its natural and poses no long-term risk. Leiserowitz says its the sixth group, The Dismissives, that is the most problematic, even though it comprises just 15% of the public. They say its a hoax, scientists are making up data, its a U.N. conspiracy (or) Al Gore and his friends want to get rich. Leiserowitz goes on to say, Its a really loud 15%. ... (Its a) pretty well-organized 15%. And thanks to the media and the political stage, that vocal minority is mighty. Former presidential candidate Rick Santorum told Glenn Beck on Fox News in 2011, There is no such thing as global warming. Santorum went on to tell Rush Limbaugh, Its just an excuse for more government control of your life, and Ive never been for any scheme or even accepted the junk science behind the whole narrative. And just last week, tea party favorite Sen. Ted Cruz told CNNs Dana Bash, Climate change, as they have defined it, can never be disproved, because whether it gets hotter or whether it gets colder, whatever happens, theyll say, well, its changing, so it proves our theory. Meanwhile, the climate change counter movement has been helped along by an infusion of cash from, among others, some in the powerful fossil fuel industry. A recent study by Drexel University found that conservative foundations and others have bankrolled climate denial to the tune of $558 million between 2003 and 2010. Money amplifies certain voices above others and, in effect, gives them a megaphone in the public square. Powerful funders are supporting the campaign to deny scientific findings about global warming and raise public doubts about the roots and remedies of this massive global threat, writes environmental scientist Robert J. Brulle, the studys author. The good news is, those uninformed minority voices are being quieted by nature and by those who have powerful voices. Extreme weather is forcing people to at least think about how global warming affects them directly. And, perhaps more important, many religious leaders, including evangelicals, are now green. They concur with the scientific community and take it a step farther. They say we have a moral obligation to save the planet. Even the enormously popular Pope Francis may soon speak out on global warming. The Vatican press office says Francis is working on draft text on ecology. That text could turn into an encyclical, or a letter to bishops around the world, instructing that the faithful must respect the environment. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.

Wake up to the reality of climate change,"Bill Richardson: New report says the science is clear: The world is warming in dangerous waysImpact of climate change is being felt on every continent, the report findsHe says governments and companies are taking steps to respond to the threat Richardson: Ultimately, setting a national price for carbon is the way to transition to the future Nothing poses a bigger threat to our water, our livelihood and our quality of life than a warming climate. Those are my words from 2006 upon the signing of an executive order on climate change for New Mexico when I was governor. Almost a decade later, this statement still holds true. But now we have even more information about climate change, both the risks and solutions. The just-released report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a collection of more than 800 leading climate scientists, reaffirms that climate impacts are already occurring and having a dramatic impact on society. Climate change is driven by our dependence on fossil fuels and is expected to get worse. In order to shift directions, we need nothing less than to rethink how we power our country. Heres what we know: The climate science is settled. The IPCC report is the latest addition to a staggering body of scientific research connecting our energy choices to costly climate disruption. The report is consistent with several other authorities  such as the National Academy of Sciences, U.S. Global Change Research Program, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  that bring stronger language and greater certainty about climate change and its risks. Just as we know that smoking causes cancer, we understand that human activity causes climate change. Climate change is happening now and we are all feeling the effects. Earlier this month, the American Association of Advancement of Science reminded us that climate change is happening here and now. We are now witnessing how it is changing our world: The past winter was the eighth-warmest on record. For 348 consecutive months  29 years  global temperatures have been above average. The latest IPCC report finds that impacts from climate change are widespread and consequential and they are being felt on every continent and in our oceans. The world last year experienced 41 weather-related disasters that caused damages totaling at least $1 billion. Over the past decade, the western United States experienced seven times more large-scale wildfires than it did in the 1970s. Climate change has made it much more likely that we will suffer severe droughts like the one that recently swept across Texas and my home state of New Mexico. Finally, without action, things will get a lot worse. As climate impacts mount, they will bring more damage to our economy and communities. Even 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) of global temperature rise could cut yields of crops like wheat, rice and corn, driving up food prices. Unless greenhouse gases are reined in, many more people will be at risk from devastating flooding, similar to what residents faced in Boulder, Colorado, last year. Overall, economic losses from climate change will cause a significant blow to the global economy, even at the lower end of climate projections. So what can we do in the face of a changing climate? Fortunately, local leaders, including mayors and governors, are responding to climate impacts and building more resilient communities. For example, city officials from Chicago to Miami are taking steps to reduce urban flooding with permeable pavement, dampen extreme heat with green roofs, and redesign levies to withstand stronger storm surges. At the federal level, the Obama administration has called for additional funding for climate resilience and just unveiled a climate data initiative to arm communities with better information about climate change. Opinion: Climate change could cost more than $100 billion a year But, its clear that we need to do more. According to the IPCC, by significantly reducing emissions we can avoid the worst consequences of climate change and cut economic damages by half. Were making progress already. Americans are embracing clean energy, buying solar panels at a record pace as the price has plummeted by 80% in just four years. Many large companies, like Apple, Google and Walmart, are investing heavily in renewable energy. Even ExxonMobil is among dozens of U.S. businesses now operating with an internal price on carbon. And important new emissions standards are coming. Under the U.S. Climate Action Plan the president announced last year, the Environmental Protection Agency is moving ahead with standards to reduce carbon pollution from existing coal-fired power plants  the largest source of U.S. emissions. These rules are the most significant opportunity to cut U.S. emissions in the near term and will help the country play a leadership role in the run-up to a universal climate agreement in 2015. The science tells us that much deeper reductions are needed in the decades ahead. Ultimately, a national price on carbon would be the most effective way to expedite a transition to a safer, low-carbon future. The evidence is overwhelming: Further inaction guarantees disaster. Alternately, we can re-balance our energy mix and rise to the challenge of the 21st century. Lets hope that a decade from now we will look back with confidence that we stood up to the global climate crisis. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.

5 things you can do about climate change,"Climate expert: Most important thing is to inform yourselfRecycling and reusing can reduce costs and up efficiencies Buy an energy efficient vehicle Climate change isnt something in the far-off future: Its a potentially disastrous reality thats already starting to have effects that are expected to worsen, experts say. Longer summers and heavier rainfalls are some of the impacts Americans are already seeing, according to the National Climate Assessment. We should expect more flooding, wildfires and drought. The report, a new White House update released Tuesday, calls for urgent action on climate change. Climate change is here and action needed now, new White House report says So what can you do at home to take action? 1. Become informed The most powerful way that the average person can combat climate change is to become informed about it, says J. Marshall Shepherd, former president of the American Meteorological Society and professor at the University of Georgia. Obviously, it makes sense for people to be as efficient and green as possible in their thinking on a day-to-day basis, he said. But where I think the biggest impact that individuals can have is: Becoming climate literate. If you educate yourself about whats going on with climate change and what can be done about it, you can make more informed choices when it comes time to vote for the people with the power to make big decisions. Where the biggest impacts on our planet will be, will come from large-scale policy changes and solutions that are influenced by whos in office, he said. Only read trusted and verified sources of information about climate change, Shepherd said. He recommends the websites climate.gov and Climate Central (of which he is a board member) for essential facts and resources. Learn about various responses to climate change that policy makers are discussing:  Mitigation means lowering carbon dioxide levels  for instance, by instituting carbon taxes or taking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.  Adaptation means responding to the consequences of climate change  for instance, building seawalls to prepare for rising sea levels around vulnerable cities.  Geoengineering means changing the Earth itself to counteract climate change  which would include hypothetical technological interventions such as putting large mirrors in space or changing our oceans to absorb more carbon dioxide, Shepherd said. Beyond reading up on the issues, you can still do a small part to influence the big environmental picture. 2. Make changes at home The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency lists steps to limiting your greenhouse gas emissions, which would also save you money. These include:  Changing your five most-used light fixtures or bulbs to products that have the EPAs Energy Star label;  Heat and cool more efficiently, such as by using a programmable thermostat, changing air filters and replacing old equipment with Energy Star products;  Seal and insulate your home;  Make use of recycling programs, and compost food and yard waste; Reduce water waste; Use green power, such as solar panels; Estimate how much greenhouse gas you emit with the EPAs calculator. The U.S. Department of Energy has an online guide to buying green power. Check out clean energy resources and financial incentives in your area through the Database of State Incentives for Renewables & Efficiency. 3. Be greener at the office If you have a desk job, there are plenty of things you can do to reduce your emissions while at work. The EPA advises:  Set computers and other office equipment to power down during periods when youre not using them;  Use Energy Star equipment;  Recycle and reuse whenever possible; The David Suzuki Foundation, an environmental nonprofit organization, additionally recommends using video conferencing to reduce air travel for business. 4. Reduce emissions in transit Whether its taking a vacation or doing your daily commute, you can reduce your carbon footprint in simple ways that also save money. The EPAs recommendations include:  Rely on public transportation, biking, walking, carpooling or telecommuting instead of driving;  Use the EPAs Green Vehicle Guide to help you make an informed choice about buying a car;  While driving, try not to do hard accelerations, dont spend more than 30 seconds idling, and go easy on the gas pedal and brakes;  Make sure to regularly check your tire pressure. When you have to take an airplane, the David Suzuki Foundation recommends:  When flying, consider packing lighter because less fuel is consumed with less weight on the plane;  Fly during the day because night flights have a bigger impact on climate;  Buy carbon offsets  or credits  to compensate for the emissions on your flight . 5. Get involved and educate others about the big picture Your green strategies in your daily life can have a small impact, but the whole planet has to be on board for dealing with climate change in order to instigate global effects. Even if everyone in the United States reduced their emissions, other countries that continue to dump carbon dioxide into the air would still contribute to warming temperatures and rising sea levels. Spread the word about climate change and educating people. The EPA recommends that students give presentations on climate change and encourage their institutions to increase energy efficiency. Find out if your community has a climate action plan. There may be ways you can contribute to local efforts to be greener and adapt to potential changes that a warming world would bring. Bottom line: Most of the public will never read the full National Climate Assessment, Shepherd said.

"Climate change is here, action needed now, says new White House report","NEW: President Obama says climate change happening now A new government report outlines how climate change already affects the country Administration officials ""fanning out"" across the country to publicize the report Republicans criticize proposed government steps on climate change Climate change is here and will only worsen. Get used to more flooding, wildfires and drought, depending on where you live. Cities and states across America already are spending lots of money to respond. Those are the take-home messages of a new White House report released Tuesday that is part of President Barack Obamas second-term effort to prepare the nation for the impacts of a changing climate such as rising sea levels and increasingly erratic weather. The National Climate Assessment update said evidence of human-made climate change continues to strengthen and that Americans are noticing changes all around them. This is not some distant problem of the future, Obama told NBC, while John Holdren, who directs the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said climate change already is affecting every region of the country and key sectors of the economy. Read the National Climate Assessment The Obama administration wants the report to ignite awareness of the need for government and communities to respond now to climate change in the face of fierce political opposition, mostly from conservatives. Unrelenting political opposition A relentless campaign backed by the fossil fuel industry and its allies challenges whether climate change is real, and if so, whether human activity such as increased carbon emissions from power plants, factories and cars contributes to it. In a statement coinciding with the reports publication, the White House said the findings underscore the need for urgent action to combat the threats from climate change, protect American citizens and communities today, and build a sustainable future for our kids and grandkids. Breaking down the report by region John Podesta, a Democratic operative who now counsels the President, told reporters that Obama will kick off a broad campaign this week to publicize the report, while Cabinet members and other administration officials would be fanning out across the country to spread the word about how climate change impacts specific regions. Republican critics immediately pounced on new report as a political tool for Obama to try to impose a regulatory agenda that would hurt the economy. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky mocked what he described as the hypocritical stance of liberal elites who demand strong action on climate change while failing to reduce their own carbon footprint. Even if we were to enact the kind of national energy regulations the President seems to want so badly, it would be unlikely to meaningfully impact global emissions anyway unless other major industrial nations do the same thing, McConnell said in arguing against proposals to reduce industrial pollution. He called the debate cynical because Obama knew that much of the pain of imposing such regulations would be borne by our own middle class. Changing attitudes? To Podesta and Holdren, the reality of climate change will win out over opponents of new energy policies to combat it. Public awareness has been going up and will continue to go up, Holdren told reporters, predicting increased public support for government action to reduce U.S. carbon emissions and for America to take a leadership role on climate change in the international arena. Five things you can do Recent polling indicates most Americans believe human activities cause climate change, but also shows the issue is less important to the public than the economy and other topics. A Gallup poll in March found that 34% of respondents think climate change, called global warming in the poll, posed a serious threat to their way of life, compared to 64% who responded no. At the same time, more than 60% of respondents believed global warming was happening or would happen in their lifetime. More than 300 experts helped produce the report over several years, updating a previous assessment published in 2009. Podesta called it actionable science for policymakers and the public to use in forging a way forward. Scientists categorize the response to climate change into two strategies  minimizing the effects by reducing the cause, which is known as mitigation, and preparing for impacts already occurring or certain to occur, which is called adaptation. The report breaks the country down by region and identifies specific threats should climate change continue. Major concerns cited by scientists involved in creating the report include rising sea levels along Americas coasts, drought in the Southwest and prolonged fire seasons. Sea levels rising It predicts sea levels will rise at least a foot by the end of the century and perhaps as much as four feet, depending on how much of the Greenland and Antarctic ice shelf melts. Such an outcome could be catastrophic for millions of people living along the ocean, submerging tropical islands and encroaching on coastal areas. Low-lying U.S. cities already experience high flooding, with Miami planning to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to address the problem, noted Jerry Melillo of Marine Biological Laboratory, who chaired the advisory committee that produced the new assessment. The Great Plains could experience heavier droughts and heat waves with increasing frequency, while more wildfires in the West could threaten agriculture and residential communities, the report notes. Obamas week-long focus on climate change continues Wednesday, when the White House convenes a summit focused on green building tactics. Later in the week, Obama will announce new solar power initiatives, according to Podesta. In his first term, the President faced opposition by Republicans and some Democrats from states with major fossil fuel industries such as coal production to significant climate change legislation. He pledged to renew his efforts on the issue in his final four years, including using executive actions that bypass Congress. Obama has introduced new regulations on vehicle emissions and created climate hubs that help businesses prepare for the effects of climate change. A major upcoming issue is a proposal under consideration by the Obama administration to build the Keystone XL pipeline, which would transport tar sands oil from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. Environmental groups say the project would contribute to climate change because tar sands oil is dirtier than conventionally drilled crude, and importing it would maintain the countrys dependence on fossil fuels. Republicans and some Democrats from oil industry states want the pipeline approved to create jobs and bolster exports from a strategic ally and U.S. neighbor. The new assessment calls for continued mitigation steps including regulations and programs to reduce carbon emissions, as well as necessary planning and investment to deal with the known impacts. Melillo cited some adaptation measures already underway, noting a terrific plan for extreme heat events by the city of Philadelphia. Things are starting to happen, Melillo said, adding that the continued efforts over time will ultimately present a very positive picture about Americans taking action on climate change.",06/05/2014,https://edition.cnn.com/2014/05/06/politics/white-house-climate-energy/index.html
Opinion: Why climate change is an ?verybody issue?now,"People's Climate March takes place Sunday in cities around the worldPatel: World is rushing towards a series of potentially catastrophic tipping points on climatePatel: We need to shift societies off oil and gas energy and onto renewable energy in a generation Scientists are normally a pretty measured bunch. But in recent months, theyve been resorting to some unusual language to get our attention. One top climatologist recently tweeted: If even a small fraction of Arctic sea floor carbon is released to the atmosphere, were fd. When scientists start swearing in public, it is time for everyone to start worrying. Its not just the scientists that are raising the alarm. This Sunday, hundreds of thousands of people are taking to the streets around the world in the largest climate mobilization in history. If they werent listening before, our leaders should tune in now. The voice of global concern for action on climate change is back, and this time its no longer an environmental issue, its an everybody issue. And time is short. The world is rushing towards a series of potentially catastrophic feedback loops and tipping points in the climate system, which could see the support system of life itself irrecoverably disrupted. From the release of gigantic amounts of arctic methane gas, to the rapid carbon acidification of our oceans, to apocalyptic flooding, the continued warming of our planet is the greatest challenge our species has faced. The stakes seem too gargantuan to grasp, but its this leap in consciousness thats required for our survival. Our civilization is built on a fragile, delicately interdependent, and unsustainable relationship with the natural world. We cant afford to underestimate the massive footprint that humans have on this planet. One quarter of the carbon dioxide in our atmosphere came from our industries. Our oceans are acidifying 10 times faster than at any point in earths history. We are stretching the limits of this world. But none of this is grounds for despair. The solution to the nightmare of runaway climate change is crystal clear, and beautiful. We need to shift our societies and economies off dirty energy and on to 100% clean, sustainable energy, within a generation. This goal is entirely achievable. Already, 22% of the worlds electricity comes from clean energy and the sector is growing fast  we just need to put our foot on the accelerator. Im on the front lines of this crisis Getting to 100% clean will require a massive battle against the oil and coal industry and their pocket politicians whose subsidies, profits and influence are all at stake. But this change is possible - we now have the alternative energy technology we need to replace fossil fuels. In May, Denmark published a plan to get to 100% clean by 2050, at a cost of less than 20 Euros per Dane per year. Countries as diverse as Norway and Uruguay are already nearly at 100% clean. Even China, the worlds biggest carbon emitter, is rolling out renewables faster than anywhere else on Earth. The question is not whether we will make this breakthrough, but whether we do so before it is too late. The clock is ticking, the increase in temperature rising steadily towards the 2 degrees Celsius mark - the red line that both scientists and governments have said poses unacceptable risk of the unthinkable. And that is why the Peoples Climate March is so critical. There is a gap between the speed of action our survival requires and the action our governments are taking. The street is how we close that gap, because politicians will move faster when people move them. Most large-scale social change has been spurred by movements, from ending slavery to giving women the right to vote. Saving ourselves by shifting our societies to 100% clean energy will require one of the largest, most diverse, and most sustained movements weve ever seen. On Sunday, that movement will step forward. A new cast of characters in an unprecedentedly broad coalition and cross section of society will take to the street. Climate change has gone beyond environmentalism, its now about the economy, jobs, justice, family, security. Its about the survival of everything we love. The UN Climate summit happening two days after the march is an opportunity to build momentum, no more. The Paris summit next year is when well need our leaders to sign a new global agreement. If we learned one thing from the 2009 Copenhagen summit, its that one global summit will never be a panacea. But the thud of peoples boots marching across the planet together with 130 leaders meeting to discuss a collective response to this crisis heralds a fresh momentum for the road ahead. Even before the mobilization has happened, political leaders are responding to it. Some are even joining the march. In the final analysis, the question is whether we human beings are capable of being wise, farsighted, and unified enough to pass this test of survival. Many civilizations have fallen to the consequences of outstripping their environments. But our civilization is the first truly global one, with the power to end human life. One way or another, we may be the last civilization. For the sake of our children and their children, we must find the hope, wisdom and unity to save it.

"Invest now or face ?rreversible?effects of climate change, U.N. panel warns","NEW: U.N. Secretary-General says time is running out for world leaders to leadReport is ""another canary in the coal mine,"" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry saysU.N. calls for the elimination of greenhouse gas emissions by 2100IPCC says it is more certain than ever that humans are causing temperature rises The cost of fighting climate change will only climb if industrialized nations dont take steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the United Nations panel on the matter warned Sunday in its wrap-up report. In its synthesis report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said that the hundreds of authors involved in the study were even more certain than before that the planet is warming and humans are the cause. If left unchecked, climate change will increase the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems, the report said. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told reporters that action must come soon. Leaders must act. Time is not on our side, he said. The report said there are solutions to keeping the rise in temperatures from crossing a 2-degree Celsius increase, the goal of many governments. It is technically feasible to transition to a low-carbon economy, said Youba Sokona, the co-chairman of IPCC Working Group III. But what is lacking are appropriate policies and institutions. The longer we wait to take action, the more it will cost to adapt and mitigate climate change. Previously the group has said that about half of the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere since the dawn of the industrial age has been produced since 1990. On the current path, global average temperatures could go up anywhere from 3.7 to 4.8 degrees C (6.7 to 8.6 F) over pre-industrial levels by 2100. According to the IPCC, to stay below a 2-degree C increase, greenhouse gas emissions need to fall as much as 70% around the world by 2050 and to zero by 2100. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the report is another canary in the coal mine and added that ambitious, decisive and immediate action is needed. We have that opportunity, and the choice is in our hands, R. K. Pachauri, chairman of the group, said in the report. John Coleman, a weather forecaster and a founder of the Weather Channel, said climate change is not happening. There is no significant man-made global warming now. There hasnt been any in the past, and theres no reason to expect any in the future, Coleman told CNNs Reliable Sources. Coleman said governments pay scientists to study the issue and researchers reach expected conclusions in order to continue to receive funding. Therefore the large percentage of climate scientists who agree there is climate change is a manipulated figure, he said. They dont have any choice, added Coleman, who said he is a skeptic, not a denier. If youre going to get the money, you have got to support their position. But David Kenny, CEO of the Weather Channel, said Colemans opinion is at odds with the channels stance, which he said has been unwavering since 2007. The Weather Channels statement says that the Earth is indeed warming and cites strong evidence that the majority of the warming over the past century is a result of human activities. Weather Channel distances itself from a founder The science is really clear, and I dont like our brand being associated with something thats not scientifically based, Kenny told Reliable Sources, adding that Coleman hasnt been associated with the channel in decades. The chief scientist at the United Kingdoms Met Office said the IPCC report gives governments the science to help make policy decisions. Julia Slingo added that supercomputing will also advance the science. By doing this we can provide a solid evidence base to ensure UK investment decisions, and our future prosperity, remain resilient to future climate risk, she said in a written statement. The report didnt estimate a price for global changes. The Synthesis Report finds that mitigation cost estimates vary, but that global economic growth would not be strongly affected, it said. Ban said it is a myth that fixing climate change will be expensive. Inaction will have large financial and societal costs, he said. He pointed to renewable energy and increased efficiency as two ways to address the issue. The IPCC said the report is based on 30,000 scientific papers studied by about 830 authors and 2,000 reviewers. The reports from the IPCC are aimed at guiding world leaders as the United Nations attempts to work out a new treaty to limit emissions. Paris will host the next major international climate summit, scheduled to start November 30, 2015. Previous rounds of talks have been strained by disputes between the biggest emitters  China, the United States and European countries  and poorer countries whose populations could see the worst impacts first.",02/11/2014,https://edition.cnn.com/2014/11/02/world/ipcc-climate-change-report/index.html
Obama: No greater threat to future than climate change,"Obama met with scattered applause when he calls climate change greatest threat to future generationsChina and U.S. are leading polluters in the world2015 is pivotal for Paris talks on climate change and setting emissions limit What President Barack Obama described as the greatest threat to future generations was neither terrorism nor ISIS. It wasnt nuclear weapons in rogue states either. No challenge poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change, said Obama in his State of the Union speech Tuesday. His statement was met with scattered, muted applause. The United States should lead in international efforts to protect the one planet weve got, he said. 2014 was the warmest year since record keeping began. One year doesnt make a trend, he said. But this does  14 of the 15 warmest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century. But American commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and curb global warming has been intermittent throughout the years. The United States did not ratify the Kyoto Protocol, a binding agreement in 1997 to cut greenhouse gas emissions. A 2007 U.N. climate change conference ended with anger at the United States, then under the Bush administration, when it balked at binding carbon cuts. We were used to having U.S. as a pariah, said Liz Gallagher, the program leader of climate diplomacy at E3G, an environmental group. Environmentalist noted a shift in recent years under Obama, including a recent agreement with China to reduce emissions. Its better to have America inside the game than outside. It makes it easier to persuade everyone else, said Gallagher. Critical year for climate change policy The U.S. remains the second greatest polluter, behind China. In a historic climate change deal in November, Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping announced that both countries would curb their greenhouse gas emissions over the next two decades. The two countries account for over one third of global greenhouse gas emissions. Because the worlds two largest economies came together, other nations are now stepping up, and offering hope that, this year, the world will finally reach an agreement to protect the one planet weve got, Obama said during his speech. A critical UN Climate Change Conference will be held in Paris in December this year, aimed at reaching a legally-binding, international climate agreement. This is a pivotal year for advancing the climate effort both at home and internationally, and the presidents continued leadership is essential on both fronts, said Bob Perciasepe, president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. Climate change disproportionately affects the most impoverished. Rising sea levels, threatened water and food supply devastate peoples lives. A U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned in a report that the effects of climate change could cost governments around the world more than $100 billion a year. Warming and warning Since 1880, the Earths average surface temperature has warmed by about 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit (0.8 degrees Celsius), according to NASA scientists. Most of the warming has occurred in the past three decades. The best scientists in the world are all telling us that our activities are changing the climate, and if we do not act forcefully, well continue to see rising oceans, longer, hotter heat waves, dangerous droughts and floods, and massive disruptions that can trigger greater migration, conflict, and hunger around the globe, Obama said. The Pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security. We should act like it.",21/01/2015,https://edition.cnn.com/2015/01/21/us/climate-change-us-obama/index.html
?oming out?on climate change,"John Sutter: Senate's climate vote is mostly hot airPoliticians should be debating solutions, he writes Well, the Senate says climate change isnt a hoax. Phew. But are we causing it? Oh no-no-no, says half the Senate. Forty-nine senators (full list here) voted on Wednesday against an amendment that said climate change is happening and, crucially, that its actually-for-real caused by human emissions. Thats something scientists are pretty darn sure about, and have been for more than a decade. These votes  particularly the not-a-hoax vote  have been heralded by some in environmental circles, including Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-California, as a sign of progress, like a coming out party of sorts. At least the senators are going on record, the argument goes. At least, in a 98-to-1 vote, they said, in public, that climate change is not a hoax. Im not so sure. True, there would be value in knowing where every senator stands on climate change. Americans  61% of whom say climate change is real and 40% of whom know its caused by people, according to to a 2014 Pew survey  have a right to know where their elected officials fall on this and many other important policy issues. But  and this is an important but  thats not what we learned on Wednesday. We learned that 98 senators say climate change is happening  without blaming humans for it. Among them is Jim Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, who is perhaps Washingtons most vocal climate denier. He continued that streak this week. Climate is changing, and climate has always changed, and always will, theres archaeological evidence of that, theres biblical evidence of that, Inhofe said on the Senate floor, according to Bloomberg News and others. The hoax is that there are some people that are so arrogant to think that they are so powerful that they can change climate. Man cant change climate. Helpful, huh? We also know that 49 senators voted against the amendment saying climate change is, in fact, caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases. That could seem like a win for the left, at least an effort to pin down senators who dont buy the science saying humans do contribute. But among the no votes was Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, who said her reason for voting no simply was the word significantly, according to The Hill. (The amendment said human activity significantly contributes to the warming climate.) Thats an artful dodge. And it means neither vote offers true clarity. These votes are more witch hunt than substance. The political left seems to want to embarrass the right for denying the facts of climate change. The right, as Elana Schor of Politico smartly noted, played this brilliantly, appearing to take a the-Earths-not-flat stance on this, while actually ceding next-to-nothing. Meanwhile, the people we actually need to be listening to on this issue are not the politicians. Theyre the climate scientists, who have been saying for years that the climate is changing, that human emissions of greenhouse gases are the driving cause, and that we need to act urgently to cut emissions. I hate doom-and-gloom climate politics as much as the next guy, but thats the reality. And heres the other part of it: Theres time to act. Congress should debate how to respond to climate change, not its very existence. The other voices that need to be heard in this debate are those of ordinary people, all over the world, who already are seeing their lives and livelihoods disturbed by warming temperatures and changing oceans. I met some of them last year at a 300,000-person climate rally in New York. Theyre people like Bren Smith, this oyster farmer in Connecticut. And Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner, a young mom from the Marshall Islands, in the Pacific, whose nation may be sunk by rising sea levels. I am fearful, she told me, but for the most part, Im optimistic. Congress could take note, and so should we. We should listen to their stories. Listen to the science. Debate the solutions. And skip the rest. Its mostly hot air.

U.S. has bold plan to stall climate change,"Bill Richardson: U.S announced plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025He says China, India, major corporations, cities among those already setting goals for cutting emissions. U.S. must lead in this effort In baseball, theres a traditional comeback after a tough season: Wait til next year! For climate change next year is now. This year is the time and the United Nations international climate negotiations in Paris in December are the place to secure strong global agreement to curb heat-trapping emissions. A successful climate pact will send a signal around the world that a shift to a low-carbon economy is underway. The United States has made clear that it is ready to step up to the plate on climate change. The U.S. administration on Tuesday unveiled details about its proposal to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025. This common-sense and achievable plan to decarbonize the U.S. economy will result in significant cost savings from cleaner technologies and create more American energy jobs to power our homes and businesses. This is an area where the United States needs to lead, and doing so will create a better planet for our children and a more prosperous future for our country. The United States isnt alone in this global climate effort. In a landmark joint announcement with the United States in November, China unveiled its intent to peak its carbon emissions around 2030 and to double its share of zero-carbon energy to 20%. This shift will require substantial effort from China to retool its economy, increase investment in renewable energy and divest from coal. As the worlds No. 1 investor in renewable energy, China has already taken important steps forward. At the same time, India has set the audacious goal of installing 100 gigawatts of solar power capacity by 2022, a 30-fold increase from current levels and eight times more solar capacity than the United States has today. Cities and corporations are joining in as well. More than 200 cities, home to 436 million people, have voluntarily committed to saving 13 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions by midcentury. And more than a thousand companies, along with 73 countries, voiced support for putting a price on carbon and moving to cleaner energy technologies. Leading companies, like Apple and Google, are making major bets on renewable energy. And another 25 businesses have signed onto the Corporate Renewable Energy Buyers Principlesthese companies represent energy demand equal to more than 1 million homes. Increasing examples demonstrate that strong climate action can be good for the economy. For instance, renewable sources now provide one-fifth of the worlds electricity, while solar manufacturing costs have dropped 80% in the last seven years. Wind turbines installed now are 100 times better at generating power than turbines were 30 years ago. Clean technology investments surged to $310 billion last year. In the United States, carbon emissions fell by 10% from 2007 to 2013, the largest absolute emissions reduction recorded, even as the United States has recovered from the Great Recession. Many of these shifts are unprecedented and could not have been anticipated even five years ago. Yet these trends alone are not enough to counter the mounting climate-related impacts that we are already seeing. A global climate agreement in Paris this December can send more signals to markets and drive more ambitious climate action for decades to come. A Paris agreement would represent a new form of international cooperation and a fundamental change in the global approach to climate action  a shift from burden-sharing to the creation of mutual opportunities; from cost to investment; from economic threat to a spur to economic development. With the United States showing the way, and with cooperation from other countries, businesses, investors, cities and citizens, we can achieve a prosperous and secure future for all. Each year, baseball returns and hope springs eternal. Now, its time for all countries to get in the game. Read CNNOpinions new Flipboard magazine. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.

2 degrees: The most important number you?e never heard of,"tl;dr version: You can vote on the first story Ill report as part of this new series on 2 degrees Celsius  which is the agreed-upon threshold for dangerous climate change. Go here if you dont see the poll. Thanks! * * * * * In 2013, I did something thats a little scary for a journalist. I asked you to tell me what to cover. In the two years since, Ive traveled the world writing about social justice issues that you selected in an online poll: I went undercover in Southeast Asia to follow the illegal trade in the pangolin, the worlds most trafficked mammal; I flew to a lawless town in Alaska to learn why that state has Americas highest rate of reported rape; I spent three weeks kayaking (and walking) a river in California thats so dry it fails to reach the sea; and I met a family in Silicon Valley thats living in a garage despite that regions booming wealth from the technology sector. Those experiences have strengthened my belief in the power of democratic journalism. Editors shouldnt get all the control. You, the audience, have a vital say, too. Still, in the two years since I asked for your ideas, I havent done much, if anything, to address one of the topics you most frequently asked me to cover: climate change. Im hoping to make good on your request now. Starting today, Earth Day, Im planning to spend the rest of the year writing about one tiny little number  2 degrees. It may be the most important number youve never heard of. Maybe that plan sounds excessive. (Eight months reporting on one number!?) But heres why it matters: If we humans warm the world more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit), we greatly up the odds of climate catastrophes. Think super droughts, rising seas, mass extinctions and acidifying oceans. We dont want to cross that mark. Humans never have lived in post-2-degree world, said Carlo Jaeger, chair of the Global Climate Forum, based in Germany, and author of a paper on this history of 2 degrees. If we start warming the planet way beyond what humans have ever experienced, God knows what will wait for us, he told me. Good news, though. If we drastically cut carbon emissions, we can stay below the 2-degree threshold. As part of this series, Ill be exploring exactly what it would take to do so. This matters a great deal this year, since the United Nations will gather leaders and policy experts in Paris in December to try to hammer out a new international agreement on climate change. Two degrees will be one useful benchmark to see if the world is on track. Its almost kind of like a truth keeping mechanism, said Jennifer Morgan, global director of the climate change program at the World Resources Institute. It would be hard if it didnt exist to have a sense of whether countries are on track or not. Its not a perfect yardstick. But its a reasonable one. Think of it like a speed limit, said Jaeger, the economist in Germany. Would a 51 mph limit be better than 50? Or maybe it should be 49? The point isnt the exact number, its the ballpark: 200 mph would certainly be too fast, as he put it, but 20 mph is too slow. For climate change, the point is we dont know the world will fall into crisis at exactly 2 degrees and not 2.1 or 1.8. But that range is certainly dangerous. The way I think of it is like smoking, said Katharine Hayhoe, an atmospheric scientist and director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech. How many cigarettes are too many? I dont know. I have no idea. Nobody has any idea. But we do know the more cigarettes you smoke, the greater the risk. Two degrees, then, is our most educated estimate. A way to focus attention. Its incredibly valuable in that respect. Since the number emerged from a relatively obscure academic paper in the 1970s, its become widely agreed upon in the international community. In 2009, for example, 114 countries initially signed onto the Copenhagen Accord, a nonbinding agreement that recognizes the scientific view that the increase in global temperature should be below 2 degrees Celsius. That level of consensus is rare on this topic. If theres one thing the world has agreed upon about climate change its 2 degrees should be the benchmark, said Jamie Henn, co-founder of 350.org, an advocacy group. Ill be writing more about the origins of 2 degrees soon  where this number came from (one guy, turns out, and I chatted with him), how soon we may cross that mark if we dont take action (short answer: 2050), and how much weve warmed the planet since the start of the industrial revolution, in the late 1800s, which is how these temperature increases are usually measured (0.85 degrees). Right now, though, Id like to ask you to do something thats scary and exciting. I want you to vote on the first project Ill report for this series. All of the options center on one theme: What does a post-2-degree world look like? I love that question because it  like all six choices youll see below  came from you. CNN hosted a Facebook chat on Friday, asking our audience to come up with questions for me about climate change or about 2 degrees of warming. Many of you said you wanted to know what a 2-degree world would have in store, in general. Other folks asked about specific impacts to people and ecosystems if the climate continues to inch toward that dangerous 2-degree mark. Clay Miller, from Alaska, for example, asked about the Arctic. Cindy Johnson wanted to know which animals would go extinct first. Jon Locke was among those curious about farms. And many of you, including Kayla Helton, from Florida, asked about rising seas. Kelly, a 48-year-old from California, wanted to know what would happen to climate refugees as the coast vanishes. Now its your turn. Pick the idea you like best. The topic with the most votes on Monday at 5 p.m. ET is the one Ill report in May. Look for more votes like this in the future as we explore this number together.

Climate: 7 questions on 2 degrees,"Experts have raised red flags about the warming of planet by 2 degrees CelsiusJohn Sutter: This one little number is significant as a way to focus world's attention on problem Were 2 degrees from a different world. Humans never have lived on a planet thats 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) warmer than it was before we started burning fossil fuels, in the late 1800s, and climate experts say we risk fundamentally changing life on this planet if we do cross that 2-degree mark. This is gambling with the planet, said Gernot Wagner, the lead senior economist at the Environmental Defense Fund and co-author of the book Climate Shock. Think super droughts, rising seas and mass extinctions. Yet for all of its importance, I dont think the 2-degree threshold is as famous as it should be. Ive heard it referred to as the north star for climate negotiations. Meaning: This one little number carries huge importance as a way to focus the worlds attention. Its so significant that its going to be the subject of my reporting for the rest of the year. Im calling that effort 2 degrees, and I need your help to make it work. Until 5 p.m. ET Monday, you can vote on the first story Ill report for the series. Vote using the Facebook poll below (or go here if you dont see it.) All of those story ideas came from you, by the way. They focus on what a 2-degree world might look like. CNN kicked off this effort with a Facebook chat last week. We asked for your questions about climate change and about the 2-degree threshold, specifically. I dont have all the answers right now. Well continue to explore the importance of this number together. But below youll find quick responses to seven basic questions about this crucial number. Many of them come straight from you, the readers. And I tossed in a couple of my own. If youd like to follow this project as it evolves, Id encourage you to sign up for the 2 degrees newsletter. And feel free to ask more questions in the comments section below. Theyll shape the way I spend the rest of the year reporting on this super-critical number. One guy, it turns out. William Nordhaus, an economist at Yale. Nordhaus, 73, proposed the 2-degree threshold in a 1977 (1977!) paper titled Economic Growth and Climate: The Carbon Dioxide Problem. The estimate was crude, but it was a reasonable first start, he told me. If there were global temperatures more than 2 or 3 degrees above the current average temperature, this would take the climate outside of the range of observations which have been made over the last several hundred thousand years, he wrote in The Climate Casino. A growing body of research now supports the idea. Science has continued to raise red flags about 2 degrees of warming. And that work has led policy experts to conclude that a 2-degree world is something none of us should want. You need a judgment call for these things, said Carlo Jaeger, chair of the Global Climate Forum, who has written on the history of 2 degrees Celsius. And this 2-degree thing was a judgment call that happened at the interface of science and policy. Germany was first to push 2 degrees as an policy goal, Jaeger told me. That happened in the 1990s. Later came the European Commission, the G8, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and, most significantly, the Copenhagen Accord, which was signed by more than 100 nations who agreed 2 degrees would be too much. The United States was among the signatories. Im going to spend the month of May exploring this question, so look for more on this. But here are some striking facts about what scientists expect a post-2-degree world to look like. These are pulled from reports by the National Research Council, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the World Bank.  Wildfires in the United States are expected to increase 400% to 800% in size.  Hurricanes are expected to become 2% to 8% more intense. A range of species will be at risk for extinction, particularly amphibians. The IPCC estimates 20% to 30% of animals and plants species will be at increasingly high risk of extinction at or near the 2-degree mark. The Arctic is expected keep melting, losing 30% of its annual average sea ice. Certain crop yields in the United States, India and Africa are expected to decrease 10% to 30%. The availability of freshwater is expected to decline by 20%. So ... not good. And numbers dont convey the emotional toll. Im from New Mexico, said Nordhaus, the economist who proposed the 2-degree threshold. I love it there, and I know its going to be a completely different climate. The trout fishing probably wont be as good. The hiking wont be as good. These forests may look completely different, or burn down. I love to ski. Its one of my things I love most. And thats obviously affected by warming. I love the ocean, and the New England coastline, and its in peril. Thats just for starters. No one knows, exactly. Think of 2 degrees like a sort of speed limit  or a zone of increased risk. Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech, told me that burning fossil fuels is like smoking. How many cigarettes give you cancer? No one knows, exactly. But the more you smoke, the more you up your risk. And 2 degrees, policy experts agree, is certainly risky territory. Plus, everyone hates a fraction. Targeting 1 degree of warming is ridiculous because you cant do it, said Nordhaus, the economist. Three sounds too high. And you cant have a fraction because its too complicated. So two is kind of an obvious number. The climate already has warmed 0.85 degrees since the Industrial Revolution. And we reasonably can expect to reach 1.5 degrees simply based on the pollution were already putting into the atmosphere, even with very ambitious mitigation action to reduce carbon emissions, according to a 2014 report from the World Bank. Some of that warming is locked-in to the Earths atmospheric system, that organization says. The impacts of climate change already are being felt. Yes, but it wont be easy. If you want to stay below 2 degrees, you have to reduce emissions at an amazing speed  to an incredible degree, said Jaeger from the Global Climate Forum. Heres the best guess for what that amazing speed might need to look like: Cutting greenhouse gas emissions by some 80% to 90% by 2050, said Jennifer Morgan, global director of the climate program at the World Resources Institute. It depends on how much risk you want to accept, she said. Some activists, including those from 350.org and Avaaz, which together organized the largest climate change rally in history last year in New York, want to accept less risk than that. Our position is 100% clean energy, said David Sievers, a senior campaigner for Avaaz. If we continue burning fossil fuels at the current rate, we could hit 2 degrees of warming before midcentury. Scarier still, we could hit 3 to 5 degrees of warming by 2100. Some writers have called for the world to abandon the 2-degree target, saying its too ambitious, or even naive. But we need a yardstick to measure progress  and we need that north star to help us set goals that actually would be weighty enough to make a dent in this problem. If you think 2 degrees sounds bad, 5 degrees is far, far worse. The IPCC expects a 5-degree world to be characterized by major extinctions around the globe and a reconfiguration of coastlines worldwide. Just beyond that, at 6 degrees, were looking a catastro-f*** that would be almost infinitely costly, said Wagner, the Environmental Defense Fund economist. Its akin to killing the planet, basically. Or society on the planet. This much should be clear: Something has to change. If we shoot for 2 degrees and end up at 3, thats still better (or less awful) than 5 or 6. Whats important is that we maintain a sense of urgency, and keep sight of the goal. Please be in touch! I need your help to make this work. Email questions to: climate (at) cnn (dot) com.

On 6 degrees of climate change,"Climate change is all about degrees. Six degrees Celsius of warming may not sound like much  probably because temperatures can swing by 6 degrees within an hour if a warm front passes, and it doesnt mean the end of the world, said Mark Lynas, author of a book called Six Degrees: Our Future on a Hotter Planet. But if we raise global average surface temperatures by just 6 degrees above pre-industrial levels, Lynas told me, well create a scenario which is so extreme its almost unimaginable. Most of the planetary surface would be functionally uninhabitable, he said. Agriculture would cease to exist everywhere, apart for the polar and sub-polar regions, and perhaps the mid-latitudes for extremely heat-tolerant crops. Its difficult to see how crops could be grown elsewhere. Theres a certain level above which plants just cant survive. Theres a certain level where humans biologically cant survive outside as well ... The oceans would probably stratify, so the oceans would become oxygen-deficient, which would cause a mass extinction and a die off in the oceans, as well  which would then release gases and affect land. So its pretty much equivalent of a meteorite striking the planet, in terms of the overall impacts. I chatted with Lynas, a science writer in the UK, about how to avoid a 6-degree world, the international goal of limiting global warming to 2 degrees  and how to talk to kids about climate change. The following is an edited transcript of our conversation. For background: This interview came about because of you. Lynass book was one of 12 chosen by readers for a book club as part of my 2 degrees series on climate change. To follow along, and shape the coverage, sign up for the 2 degrees newsletter. Lynas has agreed to take your questions the week of June 8. Lynas: Sure, sure. Ill do my best. In the marine environment, I think the most threatened ecosystems are coral reefs. (Theyre) threatened both by coral bleaching, due to rising temperatures and ocean acidification, plus the general degradation of everyday, general human activity. Its very tough to imagine that the worlds coral reefs will continue to exist in their present day form in a 2-degree warmer world. The other most-threatened environments probably are the mountain ecosystems  where species will be left marooned in shrinking islands of habitat. As temperature rises, you can imagine biomes rising up the sides of the mountains, and species which are dependent on a certain level of temperature and humidity will get left with nowhere to go. Theres really a lot of uncertainty about this. Its possible to imagine hurricanes will become less frequent but more intense, and possibly (form) over new areas. Lynas: The overall global picture is kind of, unto them that have with be given more and unto them have not shall be taken away  if you want to get biblical. That maps out as the subtropics, which are already the drier parts of the globe, will become more water-deficient. The deep tropics will actually get more rainfall, as well as some of the mid-latitudes. But the subtropics  which is the southwest of the U.S.  would expect to see less rainfall, which indeed seems to be whats happening. That does call into question, really, the development model that large areas of the southwestern U.S. have adopted  expecting a large amount of freshwater to be available to urban areas and agriculture, which are already in a pretty arid location. So I do think its going to be hard to adapt to that change. Lynas: I used to be adviser to president of the Maldives, who is, by the way, now in jail due to there having been a coup. But his challenge, and his main agenda, when he was president, was to bring to attention the fate of the small island states  especially those that are coral atolls. For the Maldives, the entire country exists at a meter or less above sea level, and little more. Its difficult to imagine the survival of coral atoll nations at 2 degrees, it has to be said. Although the extinction process depends on the rate of sea level rise. It might take decades, it might take centuries, its not clear at the moment. But I dont think they have a very long term future. Lynas: Its a scenario which is so extreme its almost unimaginable. Not many studies have addressed this because its so far off the scale of what can be envisaged. I found myself looking back at the really serious traumatic events in the Earths geological history, which have led to mass extinctions, such as the one at the end of the Permian period, 250 million years ago, which wiped out nearly 90% of life on Earth. Actually, a lot of the mass extinctions seem to have been associated with very rapid global warming events. Humans are releasing carbon more rapidly even than took place during mass extinctions. We havent gotten there in terms of the overall amount, but were certainly moving in that direction. So its not a planet that I think any of us would want to live in, and it doesnt have to happen. While I think its important to try to visualize what a 6-degree world would look like, its also important to remember that we dont have to go there. Lynas: Most of the planetary surface would be functionally uninhabitable. Agriculture would cease to exist everywhere, apart for the polar and subpolar regions, and perhaps the mid-latitudes for extremely heat-tolerant crops. Its difficult to see how crops could be grown elsewhere. Theres a certain level above which plants just cant survive. Theres a certain level where humans biologically cant survive outside, as well. We get close enough already in the Arabian Peninsula and some other parts of the world. Remember, 6 degrees is a global average. It would be probably twice that over land and somewhat less than that over the oceans. The oceans would probably stratify, so the oceans would become oxygen deficient, which would cause a mass extinction and a die off in the oceans, as well  which would then release gases and affect land. So its pretty much equivalent of a meteorite striking the planet, in terms of the overall impacts. Lynas: A lot of people want to know what warming we get with what emissions path, or what warming we might get by what date. Thats pretty fundamentally uncertain because they depend on different factors which arent very well quantified. I felt that looking at it degree by degree was much more robust. If the temperature rises by X amount then what will be Y impacts? There are three major sources of information about that. One is the observational changes were already seeing in terms of impacts in temperature rise. The second is computer models showing different ecosystem changes or whatever. And the third is paleoclimate sources  so looking at how the climate was different in earlier hotter periods in geologic time. So piecing those together and mapping them onto a degree by degree picture seemed to me to be a way to try to convey this in a visual and intuitive  but also highly scientifically appropriate  way. Lynas: I think its important to have a target  because it focuses policy and it focuses peoples efforts. And it makes sense also to have a target based on the temperature. But its not something we can meet, by definition. We dont have a simple thermostat where we can decide exactly how much carbon to emit and have an exact temperature result dependent on that. So, theres uncertainty, really, about what level of emissions will lead to what temperature outcomes, by when. However, I think that 2 degrees is really the absolute upper limit of whats tolerable in terms of ecosystems and, probably, adaptive capacities of human societies. A 2-degree world is a world without coral reefs, and with much less snow and ice and with fairly dramatic heatwaves  and other impacts. So, I would like to see a global warming future in which warming actually is lower than that, personally. Lynas: I think its possible. Its not very likely. If our current understanding of climate sensitivity is broadly correct then were probably going to come in between 2 and 3 degrees, somewhere, by the end of the century. I guess the good news is the absolutely calamitous 5 and 6 degree outcomes are particularly unlikely, too, although still possible. And certainly, the risk of them happening is higher than the risk of an airplane crashing when we get onto it. Lynas: Well, the likelihood of an airplane crashing is, I dont know, one in 1 million  or something on that order of magnitude. Whereas the likelihood of coming within 5 or 6 degrees of warming is probably more than 1 in 100. Its the sort of risk that one would not tolerate at a personal level. But, perhaps because we can diffuse responsibility, we feel that its tolerable for our species to take that gamble with the whole planet. Maybe its because we just think theres nothing we can do about it. And we have an in-built optimism bias, myself included, where we like to think that things will just turn out all right, because they often tend to. And meantime well go on with our lives as normal. Its a big ask, I guess, to make society as a whole forgo the main energy source we all enjoy, which is fossil fuels, in order to forestall uncertain impacts decades into the future. It doesnt really matter whether you find it depressing or not, its the scientific reality. We have to deal with it. A thing like climate change is known as a wicked problem. Its seen differently by different people, according to their psychological, political and cultural biases. You can frame it as just a technology challenge: Lets get off of fossil fuels and lets get onto renewables and nuclear  easy. Or you can frame it as a moral challenge: Were trespassing on the rights of future generations and how dare we do that. Or you can see it as a political challenge  that somehow these big fossil fuel corporations are transgressing democracy and forcing us to stay hooked on oil and coal and gas. Different people, according to their politics, will see climate change fundamentally in this way. Its not a simple problem to understand. Well, Im a pragmatist. I think its a solvable problem. I dont think we need to abandon capitalism or change our entire political system in order to tackle this challenge. Other people do, and I disagree with them on that. And we have debates late into the night. But I think with next-generation nuclear technologies, and particularly with the way solar power is developing so rapidly, and how rapidly its coming down in cost, and how quickly the technology is improving, there are zero-carbon options now becoming much more widely available, which will bring down our emissions much more rapidly than people think  or than people thought just a few years ago. I dont think theres any point being pessimistic about that. Pessimistic people dont achieve anything. Its important to do whats possible  and to do it quickly. Lynas: We are now inhabiting a human-dominated planet. We are in a new epoch known as the Anthropocene. The Holocene is now considered to be over. And I dont think theres really been another species that has had that effect on the planet before  maybe the first bacteria that emitted oxygen, or photosynthesizing microorganisms. But we really are into terra incognita looking forward. That gives our species a serious level of responsibility for planetary management that people just dont really appreciate at any kind of fundamental physiological or political level. We are in charge. Its up to us. We actually do have an overall effect on the earths temp. Its not up to Mother Nature anymore to run the show. Lynas: Yeah. The reason I was distracted just a minute ago was my kids just came back from school. Lynas: I talk to them a bit. They know what I do. Younger generations have grown up with this specter. Its a bit like how those of us who are older grew up with the Cold War and the threat of nuclear annihilation ... So theyre not entirely in a different situation, I suppose, from previous generations. You could feel bad for future generations, but on the other hand Im not sure their future is any worse than the future for somebody born in, say, 1900, who in all likelihood, in Europe, would have killed in one of the world wars. Its a manageable problem. Were beginning to get the grips of it. There are some positive signs already  China and the U.S. agreeing to peak emissions, and things like that. So its not a counsel of despair. And I think its important to talk to kids at that level  not to make them think that somehow theyre fundamentally doomed. That isnt the case and doesnt have to be the case. Lynas: Well, Im a ecomodernist, which is a new label a lot of environmental thinkers are beginning to attach to themselves  because its a bit different from more traditional environmentalism, which thought we were somehow doomed or we were fundamentally a destructive species. We can turn this around  this and other problems as well, if we have a more pragmatic approach to politics, economist  and especially technology. We need to have a price on carbon, so that emitting carbon dioxide isnt cheaper than other energy sources. We need to invest heavily in research and development in zero-carbon sources, including next-generation nuclear renewable energies, especially solar. And we need to deploy them on an ever wider scale, with increased financing. We also need to have a political agreement  so theres a sense the whole world is moving in the right direction. All of those things are not just possible, but I think theyre fundamentally achievable, and likely. But we need to keep the pressure up on politicians and on everyone else.

Pope Francis: ?evolution?needed to combat climate change,"As a former teacher, Pope Francis knows how to deliver a stern lecture. On Thursday, he gave one for the ages. While slamming a slew of modern trends  the heedless worship of technology, our addiction to fossil fuels and compulsive consumerism  the Pope said humanitys reckless behavior has pushed the planet to a perilous breaking point. Doomsday predictions, the Pope warned, can no longer be met with irony or disdain. Citing the scientific consensus that global warming is disturbingly real, Francis left little doubt about who to blame. Big businesses, energy companies, short-sighted politicians, scurrilous scientists, laissez faire economists, indifferent individuals, callous Christians and myopic media professionals. Scarcely any area of society escaped his withering criticism. The Earth, our home, is beginning to look more and more like an immense pile of filth, Francis said. In many parts of the planet, the elderly lament that once beautiful landscapes are now covered with rubbish. Francis bracing manifesto came Thursday in the form of an encyclical, a letter traditionally addressed from St. Peters Square to the more than 1 billion Catholics across the globe. Derived from the Greek word for circle, an encyclical is among the churchs most authoritative teaching documents. Special coverage: How 2 degrees are key to climate change But Francis has set his sights far beyond the circle of his church. With an eye toward several key climate change summits scheduled for later this year, the Pope said his letter is addressed to every person living on this planet. I would like to enter a dialogue with all people about our common home, Francis said. The humble invitation belies the damning analysis of modern life contained in the 184-page encyclical, entitled Laudato Si. The archaic Italian phrase, which means Praised Be To You, appears in the Canticle of the Sun, a song penned by St. Francis, the patron saint of ecology. Read the full encyclical (PDF) Subtitled, On Care for Our Common Home, the encyclical was published Thursday in at least five languages during a news conference at the Vatican. The document was more than a year in the making, church officials say, and draws on the work of dozens of scientists, theologians, scholars from various fields and previous popes. We have a situation here, said Janos Pasztor, the U.N.s assistant secretary-general for climate change, in which science and religion are totally aligned. Pasztor was part of a team that convened with church officials at the Vatican this April. The Popes highly anticipated encyclical recycles some of the now-familiar themes of his papacy: an abiding concern for the poor, a scorching critique of the idolatry of money and a facility for using evocative language to describe complex conundrums. As the first Pope from the developing world, Francis brings a moral vision shaped not in the seminaries of Europe but in the slums of Buenos Aires, Argentina. With language ranging from the majestic (lyrical poetry in praise of nature) to the mundane (take the bus!), the Pope put his signature stamp on a controversial topic and his moral clout on the line. Laudato si is long on laments and short on specific solutions, though the Pope repeatedly urges deep thinking and dialogue to address the complex symptoms now plaguing the planet. In broad strokes, Francis calls for a drastic change in lifestyle, production and consumption from unsustainable habits to more mindful means of caring for our common home. What kind of world do we want to leave to those who come after us, to children who are now growing up? Francis asks. The question not only concerns the environment in isolation; the issue cannot be approached piecemeal. And while the Pope calls for practical steps like recycling and improving public transportation, he said structural injustices require more political will and sacrifices than most societies seem willing to bear. Nothing short of a bold cultural revolution could save humanity from spiraling into self-destruction, the Pope warned. Though it ends with a prayer, many parts of Francis encyclical seem profoundly pessimistic, particularly from a spiritual leader known for his hopeful messages of mercy and openness. People no longer seem to believe that happy days lie ahead, the Pope lamented Our care for the environment is intimately connected to our care for each other, he argues, and we are failing miserably at both. We are not faced with two separate crises, one environmental and the other social, Francis writes, but rather one complex crisis which is both social and environmental. The rich and powerful shut themselves up within self-enclosed enclaves, Francis argues, compulsively consuming the latest goods to feed the emptiness within their hearts, while ignoring the plight of the poor. The Popes 10 commandments on climate change The poor, meanwhile, find themselves on the run from natural disasters and degraded habitats, shunted to the bottom of the worlds pile of problems with decreasing access to its natural resources. Francis saves his most challenging questions for modern consumers, arguing that humanity has become enamored of another apple  and this time no Eve or serpent are around to take the fall. The temptation may have shifted from a forbidden fruit to cutting edge technology, but the sin remains the same: hubris. We are not God, the Pope warns, The Earth was here before us and has been given to us. Powerful quotes from the Popes encyclical Though Popes since Paul VI in 1971 have addressed environmental degradation, Laudato Si is the first encyclical to focus primarily on creation care, the Christian idea that God gave humans the earth to cultivate, not conquer. Even months before its publication, the encyclical drew criticism from conservatives and climate change skeptics, who urged the Pope not to put his moral weight behind the controversial issue of global warming. Many Catholics and environmentalists, meanwhile, eagerly awaited the encyclical. The Washington-based Catholic Climate Covenant, for example, plans to send homily hints to the 17,000 Catholic parishes in the United States for priests to use during sermons this summer. The group is also planning media events with bishops in Iowa, California, New Mexico and elsewhere. In the weeks before the encyclicals release, Protestant pastors and at least 300 rabbis in the United States also said they were willing and eager to embrace Popes call for environmental justice. A Brazilian group made even made a tongue-in-cheek trailer ahead of Francis encyclical, portraying the pontiff of a spiritual superhero gearing for battle against the forces of evil  energy executives. In another sign of the anticipation awaiting the encyclical, the news that an Italian magazine had published a leaked draft of the document online on Monday made the front pages of several American newspapers. From the first days of his papacy, Francis has preached about the importance of the environment, not only as a scientific concern but also a moral one. In his first homily as pontiff, Francis called six times during the short sermon for humans to protect creation. The encyclical published on Thursday goes well beyond any sermons, delving into fields familiar to any Catholic, such as Scripture and theology, but also wandering into sociology, politics, urban planning, economics, globalization, biology and other areas of scientific research. Broken into six chapters, Laudato Si begins by cataloguing a host of ills wracking the planet: dirty air, polluted water, industrial fumes, toxic waste, rising sea levels and extreme weather. The problem is aggravated, the Pope said, by a model of development based on the intensive use of fossil fuels. If present trends continue, Francis argued, the changing climate will have grave implications for poor communities who lack the resources to adapt or protect themselves from natural disasters. Many will be forced to leave their homes, while the economically and politically powerful mask the problems or respond with indifference, the Pope said. The poor may get a passing mention at global economic conferences, Francis says, but their problems seem to be merely added to agendas as an afterthought. Indeed, when all is said and done, the Pope said of the poor, they frequently remain on the bottom of the pile. Opinion: Listen to the Pope about climate Conservatives like Rush Limbaugh called Francis a Marxist after he released another statement, called an apostolic exhortation, in 2013. In the statement, the Pope called trickle-down economics crude and naive. Limbaugh renewed the criticism on Wednesday, accusing Francis of adopting communist way of doing things: Controlling mankind through ... governments backed by police or military power. Apparently undeterred, the Pope doubles down on his critique of modern capitalism  especially aspects of the free market  in Laudato Si. We need to reject a magical conception of the market, which would suggest that the problems can be solved simply by an increase in the profits of companies or individuals, he said. Whats more, the Pope called the idea that the invisible forces of the market can adequately regulate the economy the same kind of thinking that leads to the exploitation of children and abandonment of the elderly who no longer serve our interests. In one particularly searing section, Francis compared laissez faire economists to mobsters, drug lords, illegal organ harvesters and human traffickers. All are part of a throwaway culture, the Pope argues, that treats human beings as just another commodity to exploit. The Popes attack on the myth of progress is more surprising. But he connected his critique to a worshipping of earthly powers, where humans have usurped the role of God, imposing our own laws and interests on reality with little thought to the long-term consequences. Opinion: Message from Pope: Hey you, stop ignoring climate change In particular, he argued that our cult of human power and blind adoption of technology has been a Faustian bargain, offering a wealth of benefits, but at the risk of losing our souls. Life gradually becomes a surrender to situations conditioned by technology, he said, itself viewed as the principle key to the meaning of existence. It has become countercultural, Francis continued, to choose a lifestyle whose goals are even partly independent of technology. The omnipresent digital media feeds our information overload and mental pollution, the Pope said. Those, in turn, lead to an excessive self-centeredness that tends to shield us from direct contact with the pain, the fears and the joys of others and the complexity of their personal experience. Nobody is suggesting a return to the Stone Age, he continued, but we do need to slow down and look at reality in a different way. Despite his bleak view of our present situation, the Pope offered glimmers of hope near the end of his joyful and troubling reflection. Yet all is not lost, Francis said. Human beings, while capable of the worst, are also capable of rising above themselves, choosing again what is good, and making a new start, despite their mental and social conditioning. Is the Pope right on technology? Opposition to the Popes encyclical began several months before it was released. In April, the Heartland Institute, a conservative group skeptical of climate change, mounted a campaign to convince Pope Francis that global warming is not a crisis. The Pope is putting his moral authority behind the radical environmental agenda of the United Nations  and hes doing it after being told only part of the climate story, Jim Lakely, a Heartland spokesman, said in an email interview on Tuesday. Lakely said Heartland will contact hundreds of thousands of Catholics in the United States through mail and email countering the Popes message and giving them the truth about climate change. That may be a difficult task. More Americans trust Francis almost any other world or U.S. leader as a source of information on global warming, according to a survey conducted by Yale University and George Mason University. Still, the same poll showed that less than 10% of Americans view climate change as a moral issue. 5 key questions about the Pope and climate change According to a Pew Research Center study released on Tuesday, American Catholics are divided along partisan lines over climate change. More than 7 in 10 believe the planet is getting warmer, and nearly half attribute global warming to human causes. A similar number (48%) view it as a very serious problem, according to Pew. But while more than 80% of Catholic Democrats say there is solid evidence that the Earth is warming, just half of Catholic Republicans agree. And less than a quarter of Catholic Republicans believe that global warming is a man-made or poses a very serious problem. Christiana Peppard, a professor of ethics at Fordham University, said she is not surprised that more Catholics are unconvinced that climate change presents a moral imperative. Theres an idea that science exists in a realm separate from the way we live our lives, said Peppard, author of the book Just Water: Theology, Ethics, and the Global Water Crisis. But the Catholic Church has long taught that scientific facts, while reliable, dont answer deeper questions about human meaning and morality. For that, ethical reasoning and contemplation are important, Peppard said. On the 2016 campaign trail, though, the Popes eco-encylical seemed to be a tough sell. Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, who is Catholic, said the Pope should leave science to the scientists. At a town hall in New Hampshire this week, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a Catholic convert, said, I dont get economic policies from my bishops or my cardinals or my Pope. I think religion ought to be about making us better as people and less about things that end up getting into the political realm. Pope hands GOP climate change dilemma Other Catholics, though, were eagerly awaiting the Popes encyclical. In addition to Cardinal Peter Turkson of Ghana, the Vatican panel presenting Laudato Si included Metropolitan John of Pergamon, an Eastern Orthodox priest; John Schellenuber, founding Director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research; Carolyn Wo, the Chinese-American director of Catholic Relief Services; and Valeria Martano, an Italian historian and member of the Rome-based lay Catholic Community of SantEgidio. Woo said her assignment is to connect the encyclicals concerns to the business world. Over the past 20 years, said Woo, former dean of the University of Notre Dames Mendoza College of Business, some corporations have adopted more ethical approaches, and she expects a wave of letters from business leaders this week praising the Popes initiative. The bottom line is that we need business, not just some, but all, to do more, Woo said. They are the ones on the front lines. We need them on board. The Pope will also need world leaders to buy into his moral message, which will be key before a U.N.-sponsored climate summit in December, said Pasztor of the U.N. At the meeting, nations are expected to submit their plans for reducing greenhouse gases, and the Pope will likely repeat the encyclicals entreaties when he speaks at the U.N. General Assembly this September. Having such an important person as the Pope talking about this issue will reach a lot of people, Pazstor said, and at a crucial time.

The 5 telltale techniques of climate change denial,"John Cook: Climate deniers rely on a common set of techniques to dispute the scienceCook: Knowing deniers' tactics can help inoculate people from a misleading view of reality There is overwhelming scientific evidence that humans are causing global warming. Nevertheless, a small proportion of the population continues to deny the science. This can be problematic when the small number denying climate science includes half of the U.S. Senate. How do you identify climate science denial, and how do you respond to it? To address denial properly, you need to understand the telltale techniques used to distort the science. It turns out all movements that deny a scientific consensus, whether it be the science of climate change, evolution or vaccination, share five characteristics in common: Ninety-seven percent of climate scientists agree that humans are causing global warming. This has been found independently in a number of studies, including surveys of Earth scientists, analysis of public statements about climate change and analysis of peer-reviewed scientific papers. How might one cast doubt on the overwhelming scientific consensus? One technique is the use of fake experts. We see this in online petitions such as the Global Warming Petition Project, which features more than 31,000 scientists claiming humans arent disrupting our climate. How can there be 97% consensus when 31,000 scientists disagree? It turns out 99.9% of the petitions signatories arent climate scientists. They include computer scientists, mechanical engineers and medical scientists but few climate scientists. The Global Warming Petition Project is fake experts in bulk. The reason why theres a 97% consensus is because of the many lines of evidence that humans are causing global warming. Human fingerprints are being observed in heat escaping out to space, in the structure of the atmosphere and even in the changing seasons. Another denialist technique used to counter the weight of evidence is the logical fallacy. The most common fallacious argument is that current climate change must be natural because climate has changed naturally in the past. This myth commits the logical fallacy of jumping to conclusions. Its like finding a dead body with a knife sticking out of its back, and arguing that the person must have died of natural causes because humans have died of natural causes in the past. The premise does not lead to the conclusion. While many lines of evidence inform our understanding of climate change, another source of understanding are climate models. These are computer simulations built from the fundamental laws of physics, and they have made many accurate predictions since the 1970s. Climate models have successfully predicted the loss of Arctic sea ice, sea level rise and the geographic pattern of global warming. However, one technique used to cast doubt on climate models is the tactic of impossible expectations. Some people argue that climate models are unreliable if they dont make perfect short-term predictions. However, a number of unpredictable influences such as ocean and solar cycles have short-term influences on climate. Over the long term, these effects average out, which is why climate models do so well at long-term predictions. Signs of global warming have been observed all over our planet. Ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica are losing hundreds of billions of tons of ice every year. Global sea level is rising. Thousands of species are migrating toward cooler regions in response to warming. The ocean is building up four atomic bombs worth of heat every second. One way to avoid this overwhelming body of evidence is through the technique of cherry-picking. For example, a persistent myth is that global warming stopped in recent decades. This is done by focusing on one slice of our climate system  the surface temperature record. Further, it relies on cherry-picking short time periods. This ignores the long-term trend and more importantly, ignores the many warming indicators telling us that our planet continues to build up heat. The global surface temperature record is constructed by teams across the world, each compiling their own independent record. These different efforts, each using their own methods, paint a consistent picture of global warming. Climate science deniers reject this coherent evidence with conspiracy theories. The thousands of scientists across the world who develop these temperature records are regularly accused of faking their data to inflate the global warming trend. Of course, critics produce no evidence for a global conspiracy. In fact, a number of investigations into the scientists methodology has concluded that they conducted their research with robust integrity. How do the conspiracy theorists respond to each exoneration? By expanding their conspiracy theory to include the investigators! The link between conspiratorial thinking and science denial has serious and practical consequences. Conspiracy theorists are immune to scientific evidence, as any evidence conflicting with their beliefs is considered part of a conspiracy. The implication is that the most effective approach is not changing the mind of the unchangeable. Rather a more fruitful approach is communicating the realities of climate change to the large, undecided majority who are open to scientific evidence. A crucial part of the puzzle is explaining the techniques of science denial. This has the powerful effect of inoculating people against the misinformation of climate science deniers.

Obama unveils major climate change proposal,"The White House will unveil a major climate change plan Monday, according to a sourceObama to engage in ""all-out climate push,"" according to the White House The Obama administration unveiled a major climate change plan on Sunday aimed at a large reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the nations coal-burning power plants. On Monday, President Barack Obama started selling it to the public at a White House event. Today after working with states and cities and power companies, the EPA is setting the first ever nationwide standards to end the limitless dumping of carbon pollution from power plants, Obama said Monday from the White House, adding shortly thereafter Washington is starting to catch up with the vision of the rest of the country.  The Clean Power Plan is the final version of regulations by the Environmental Protection Agency, which President Barack Obama called the biggest most important step weve ever taken to combat climate change, in a video released by the White House on social media Saturday night. Were the first generation to feel the impact of climate change and the last generation that can do something about it, Obama said on Monday. Busted: 3 myths about Obamas climate plan (Opinion) Under the plan, the administration will require states to meet specific carbon emission reduction standards, based on their individual energy consumption. The plan also includes an incentive program for states to get a head start on meeting standards on early deployment of renewable energy and low-income energy efficiency. Power plants are the single biggest source of harmful carbon pollution that contributes to climate change, Obama said in the video. Until now, there have been no federal limits to the amount of carbon pollution plants dump in the air. Even before the rule was announced, many states announced plans to fight it, including some vows to take the administration to court over the new rules. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urged states not to comply with the plan in a letter to all 50 governors. Critics also said that the plan will bring unwelcome increases in electricity prices. This plan is all pain and no gain, said Luke Popovich, vice president of communications for the National Mining Association. Thats why state leaders across the country are coming to the same conclusion  that we should not sacrifice our power system to an unworkable plan built on a faulty interpretation of the law. Four things to know about global warming In a conference call with the press, Gina McCarthy, administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, said the plan would cost a total of $8.4 billion with total benefits expected to be $34 billion to $54 billion. Some special interest critics will tell you that it cant be done, McCarthy said on Sunday. Theyll say we have to focus on the economy at the expense of the environment. Theyll tell you EPAs plan will turn the lights off and send utility bills through the roof but they are wrong. A multi-million dollar campaign backed by the energy industry has sought to debunk the science of climate change, but polls show most Americans believe the planet is warming. Coal supplied 37% of U.S. electricity in 2012, compared to 30% from natural gas, 19% from nuclear power plants, 7% from hydropower sources such as dams and 5% from renewable sources such as wind and solar, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. EPA officials have conceded in the past that some of the dirtiest power plants now operating, such as older coal-fired plants, will end up shuttered as the nation shifts its reliance from traditional fossil fuel sources to cleaner alternatives. The impending battle ahead could be seen as a major legacy issue for Obama as he transitions into the last quarter of his presidency. There are few issues more important to the president, a senior administration official said, adding that Obama is likely to make the case that climate change is a moral, economic and national security obligation in the months ahead. The news of the Presidents plan was hailed on Sunday by Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Martin OMalley but was deeply criticized by Republican candidates. It will make the cost of electricity higher for millions of Americans, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, said Sunday at the Freedom Partners Summit in California. In break with Obama, Clinton skeptical about arctic drilling If theres some billionaire somewhere who is a pro-environmental, cap-and-trade person, yeah, they can probably afford for their electric bill to go up a couple of hundred dollars, Rubio said. But if youre a single mom in Tampa, Florida, and your electric bill goes up by $30 a month, that is catastrophic. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, also running for president, said on Sunday climate change will not be solved by grabbing power from states or slowly hollowing out our economy. The real challenge is how do we grow and prosper in order to foster more game-changing innovations and give us the resources we need to solve problems like this one, he said. Expecting a tough fight, the White House will launch an all-out climate push by the President and cabinet officials to fan out to sell the plan. In the coming weeks, Obama will travel to Nevada to speak at the National Clean Energy Summit and later become the first sitting President to go to the Alaskan Arctic.",02/08/2015,https://edition.cnn.com/2015/08/02/politics/obama-climate-change-plan/index.html
100 days to save the world,"Join a live Facebook chat with John Sutter at 12 p.m. ET on SaturdaySutter: December climate talks in Paris could yield real results Weve learned to be pessimists about climate change. Every so often, we hear news about world leaders meeting in some exotic-sounding location  Copenhagen, Lima, Durban, Kyoto  to try to hammer out an agreement to curb heat-trapping gases. We know the stakes are huge  nothing short of the fate of this planet  but its become difficult to expect much out of diplomacy. The meetings have been organized around a wonkish treaty called the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or, you know, U.N.F.C.C.C. for short. Theyre attended by pretty much every country in the world. Yet all, so far, largely have failed to really put the brakes on climate change  to stop us from careening toward 2 degrees Celsius of warming, which is regarded as the benchmark for dangerous, unmanageable climate change. The 1997 Kyoto Protocol, for instance, was signed but never ratified by the United States, and even global sweetheart Canada pulled out and failed to meet its pollution targets. More recently, in 2009, talks in Copenhagen, Denmark, amounted to a sort of climate wish list, Elizabeth Kolbert wrote in The New Yorker. We cant throw out that frustrating history, of course. But we can and should do our best to shake it off, Taylor Swift-style. World leaders are set to meet again 100 days from Saturday. This time in Paris. And, this time, against all odds, theres ample evidence things finally will be different. The Paris talks are called COP21 in U.N.-speak, for the 21st meeting of the Conference of Parties. That means this is the 21st time weve done this  gathered the entire world and tried to address the global climate crisis on something resembling the scale science says is required. Im hopeful that the 21st times the charm. Its true that a Paris agreement probably will fall short, on its own, of the international communitys stated goal of halting warming at 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit). People following the talks closely tell me that meeting the 2 degrees goal in Paris would be unrealistic. (Thats not going to happen, said Nathaniel Keohane, vice president for international climate at the Environmental Defense Fund, for example). But these talks, which aptly, if ominously, have been called our last hope for climate action, must be met with bold optimism. The window for significant progress on climate is only open every once in a while, said Jennifer Morgan, global director of the climate program at the World Resources Institute. And its open  its opening  right now. Here are five reasons for optimism ahead of the talks. This U.N.F.C.C.C.s COP21 meeting in Paris is, in part, taking a bottom-up approach to negotiation. That means that rather than hashing everything out at the actual meeting in December, the big countries are deciding, now, how much climate pollution they will agree to cut. This leaves other issues on the table in Paris but gives negotiators more of a starting point than has been common in the past. The United States, for example, has announced that it will cut heat-trapping pollution 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025. China will peak its carbon dioxide pollution by 2030. The European Union is pledging even deeper cuts: at least 40% reduction in emissions below 1990 levels by 2030. Maybe that all looks like numbers soup, but the point is this: The countries are showing their cards, and theyre doing that now. Thats part of what makes an agreement of some sort inevitable in Paris, said Jake Schmidt, international program director at the Natural Resources Defense Council. In Copenhagen (in 2009), frankly, most of the big emitters announced the targets days before the conference, (and there was) not time to digest them and figure out what it meant for the agreement. This time, everyone knows where to start the process. I recently spent a week in Woodward, Oklahoma, which is one of the most climate-skeptical places in the United States. A common refrain there: It doesnt matter what the United States is doing because China has the dirtiest air in the world and it doesnt care at all about climate change. Conclusion: Why should we bother if they dont? But that logic is it is based on a very dated perspective of the world, said Schmidt, from the Natural Resources Defense Council. China has become the biggest market for renewable energy technology in the world, he told me. Despite still being the worlds biggest carbon polluter, last year (China) added more solar than the entire U.S. capacity for solar to date. That China and the United States  two of the worlds biggest economies and biggest polluters  have both made real pledges to move away from fossil fuels is hugely significant. In the United States, President Barack Obama recently announced the Clean Power Plan, which aims to use the U.S. governments regulatory authority to curb pollution from coal-fired power plants. It really bends the curve in global emissions, said Bill Hare, founder and CEO of Climate Analytics, a nonprofit that tracks pollution reduction pledges against the 2 degrees goal. That is new. In November, China and the United States announced an agreement to curb carbon pollution. That watershed moment shows that increasingly, climate is going to be an area of cooperation between China and the U.S, said Keohane, from the Environmental Defense Fund. A decade ago, such cooperation would have been unimaginable. The point of these negotiations is to avoid 2 degrees Celsius of warming. That threshold is measured since the industrial revolution, and it may be disheartening to hear that humans already have helped warm the climate by 0.8 degrees Celsius to date. To stop warming short of the 2 degrees mark, leading scientists say, the world needs to be carbon neutral by 2050, meaning no net human emissions of carbon dioxide, said Morgan, from the World Resources Institute. Climate pollution also needs to peak around 2020 and then start declining. Thats five years from now. And were not on that trajectory. Current pollution reduction pledges for the Paris agreement put the world on a much more dangerous path, one leading to an expected 2.9 to 3.1 degrees Celsius of warming, according to the Climate Action Tracker, which measures the impact of the Paris pledges. (Without those pledges, the situation would be much worse, with global temperatures expected to rise 3.6 to 4.2 degrees, the tracker shows). Two degrees of warming, or more, could be catastrophic, sinking low-lying island nations, causing mass extinctions, greatly exacerbating drought and decreasing the availability of fresh water in key areas of the globe. But the Paris agreement could still make it possible for the world to get on a path to 2 degrees. Its clear to everyone the pledges are not going to be sufficient at this step to limit warming below 2 degrees. There are no analyses that will contradict that, said Hare, of Climate Analytics. One needs to ask the question: Well given that, is it still possible to get to 2 degrees? I think its clear it still is. ... To do so, people closely following the negotiations told me, the Paris agreement needs to accomplish a few things: It should send a strong signal that the world is moving away from a fossil fuel economy, and wont turn back; it needs to ensure that pollution pledges only will get stronger over time; it needs to ensure that countries meet again, as soon as five years from now, to ratchet up their commitments; and it needs to require countries to report on their progress transparently, and for those reports to be independently verified. Whats most important is establishing the foundation for meaningful, long-term action, Robert Stavins, director of the Harvard Project on Climate Agreements, told me via email. This is as much about the road through Paris as the road to Paris, said Morgan, from the World Resources Institute. Solving this problem is a multi-decadal effort. The international agreement is an important piece of that, but its not the silver bullet. Last year, I was one of an estimated 300,000 people who marched in New York for action on climate change. That sort of grassroots mobilization on this issue is unheard of  and organizers are going to try to replicate it for the United Nations climate talks in Paris, which start on November 30. People are demanding action. Theyre calling on universities and nonprofits to divest from fossil fuel interests, greening their portfolios and dealing a symbolic and financial blow to coal. Theyre telling governments that deadly, dirty air is incompatible with economic growth. And theyre raising their voices to demand that world leaders put us on track to halt warming short of 2 degrees. Theres reason to believe this enthusiasm with infiltrate the stodgy climate negotiations in Paris. Whats going to drive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in China? Its not going to be whether the (Paris) treaty is legally enforceable or not, said Keohane, from the Environmental Defense Fund. Its going to be whether its people demand cleaner air. They are, and it appears that China  and others  are finally listening. The difference between 2 degrees and 4 degrees of warming may not sound like much, but consider this: The World Bank has said there is no certainty that adaptation to a 4-degree world is possible. A 4-degree Celsius world is likely to be one in which communities, cities and countries would experience severe disruptions, damage, and dislocation, with many of these risks spread unequally, the World Bank says in a November 2012 report. It is likely that the poor will suffer most and the global community could become more fractured, and unequal than today. The projected 4-degree warming simply must not be allowed to occur  the heat must be turned down. Even turning the heat up by 2 degrees could be seen as too costly. Take the Marshall Islands. I traveled there this year to meet people who are being displaced by frequent floods in those low-lying Pacific islands. Some experts predict that the entire country, which is made up of atolls and islands barely above sea level, will flood at 2 degrees of warming. Global warming matters too much to give up hope. Its possible to reach this target, but Paris must send the world clear signals. The next step needs to be bigger and the subsequent step bigger, and then we can get into the 2 degree pathway, or below that pathway, said Hare, of Climate Analytics. Its disappointing were going to be below the 2 degree pathway at Paris, but i dont think thats reason to give up on that target. Im concerned, he said, but not pessimistic. Neither am I. We owe it to the planet to remain optimistic.",21/08/2015,https://edition.cnn.com/2015/08/21/opinions/sutter-climate-paris-two-degrees-100-days/index.html

John Sutter, CNN columnist Question from William Breyer, Indian Harbour Beach, Florida Answer by Jennifer Gray, CNN Meteorologist Answer: Yes, according to a recent study by Adelaide University in Australia. Why? Well, we know that carbon dioxide is increasing globally and the oceans absorb huge amounts of CO2 each year. When this happens, the pH levels of the ocean are reduced. Thats because CO2 is an acid gas and when it dissolves in water, including seawater, it forms carbonic acid. As CO2 dissolves into the oceans, it fundamentally alters ocean chemistry, making it more acidic. This acid addition is where the name ocean acidification comes from and is why ocean pH is declining worldwide. One marine ecologist who has studied the issue says warmer waters are creating higher metabolic rates that, in turn, are creating a bigger demand for food. Read more of Jennifer Grays detailed answer here Question from Sital Sathia, Chicago, Illinois Answer by Brandon Miller, meteorologist, CNN International Answer: Attributing extreme weather events to climate change is one of the most important aspects of climate change research. Its also controversial. The reason for the latter: Its difficult to prove a single weather event was caused by humans burning fossil fuels and warming the planet. After all, extreme weather has occurred all over our planet long before humans started interfering with the climate system. But scientists are clear that some extreme weather events are influenced by global warming. Was the recent, devastating flooding in South Carolina caused by climate change? We dont know for sure, at least not yet. More research is needed. But we know this event has the fingerprints of climate change all over it. This flooding contained a combination of several extreme weather events that we expect to occur more frequently as a result of global warming  including extreme precipitation (i.e. a lot of rain falling in a short amount of time) and coastal flooding. Read more of Brandon Millers detailed answer here Question from Torben rvad Jensen, Denmark Answer by John D. Sutter, CNN columnist Answer: A 2012 study shows that mealworms have a smaller carbon footprint, per kilogram of edible protein, than milk, pork, chicken or beef. Beef, for example, has a carbon footprint about six to 13 times the size of mealworms, per kilogram of edible protein, the study says. Dutch entomologist Dennis Oonincx, who published the study, told me the results likely would be similar for edible crickets  which are being grown on farms as a way to help combat global food insecurity. Scientific research has not quantified exactly how much crickets contribute to climate change, although Oonincx points out that crickets likely would have a slightly larger carbon footprint, similar to that of pork or milk. Read more of John Sutters detailed answer here Question from Wayne Stoll, Ladysmith, Wisconsin Answer by John D. Sutter, CNN columnist Answer: Climate change is a problem that can no longer be left to a future generation. Thats one religious leader  the Pope  speaking in front of the White House. But as Wayne Stoll, our reader in Wisconsin, points out in this weeks Two question, some conservative Christian leaders have not joined Pope Francis on this issue. Many of them dont see climate change, as he does, as a moral outrage  and cause for urgent action. Take the Cornwall Alliance, which wrote an open letter to Pope Francis in April urging him not to support efforts to rid the world of fossil fuels. Such policies, the group wrote, would condemn hundreds of millions of our fellow human beings to ongoing poverty. We respectfully appeal to you to advise the worlds leaders to reject them. The group, in its letter, also rejects mainstream climate science, saying computer models provide no rational basis to forecast dangerous human-induced global warming. These views seem to be reflected among some churchgoers, with conservative Christians being less likely to accept mainstream climate science that says the climate is warming and humans largely are to blame. And even among religious Republicans theres an apparent split between Catholics and Protestants. Catholic Republicans, for example, are more likely to say global warming is happening than their non-Catholic Republican counterparts, according to a survey by the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication. Catholics and nonevangelical Protestants in the United States, according to that group, also are more likely to say humans are causing climate change than evangelicals. So how do religious climate doubters justify their views? I got a window into that earlier this year after I spent a week in Woodward County, Oklahoma, which is highly religious and, statistically, is one of the most climate-skeptical places in the United States. I met some conservative Christians in Woodward County who see climate change as a sign of the end times. They think its happening, but they see it as Gods punishment for an upside down world, and therefore dont think we can or should do anything about it. Others seemed almost too humble to accept climate science. They said humans are too small  too insignificant in the face of the all-knowing, all-doing Creator  to actually alter the global climactic system. For others, rejecting mainstream climate science seems more a matter of politics. You can hear climate doubters in their own words in this video from Woodward: The underlying message in much of this: God is in control. Humans cant possibly be messing things up this bad. But theres a rebuttal to that argument. The answer to that is pretty simple: Its free will, Katharine Hayhoe, an evangelical Christian and climate scientist at Texas Tech, told NPR. God gave us the brains to make good choices, and theres consequences to the choices that we make. Meanwhile, religious leaders of all stripes continue to call for action. Muslim scholars, for example, recently issued the Islamic Declaration on Global Climate Change, which prods world leaders to move quickly slash carbon emissions to zero. (W)e have now become a force dominating nature, they write. Our species, though selected to be a caretaker or steward on the Earth, has been the cause of such corruption and devastation on it that we are in danger ending life as we know it on our planet. And theres diversity of thought among conservative Christians, too. It is Gods love that calls all of us to take on this challenge, says a letter posted on the website for the Evangelical Environmental Network, addressed to President Obama. That is why we write to offer our support and encouragement for your efforts to overcome the climate challenge. Perhaps more conservative religious leaders will start speaking up. Question from Randy McNamara, San FranciscoAnswer by John D. Sutter, CNN columnist Answer: We got yet another frightening glimpse this week at the CNN Republican debate of what some U.S. presidential contenders think (or dont think) of climate science. Heres a back-and-forth between moderator Jake Tapper and Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, a noted skeptic of the science saying the Earth is warming and were causing it. Tapper: Sen. Rubio, Ronald Reagans secretary of state, George Shultz, reminds us that when Reagan was president he faced a similar situation to the one that were facing now. There were dire warnings from the mass consensus of the scientific community about the ozone layer shrinking. Shultz says Ronald Reagan urged skeptics in industry to come up with a plan. He said, Do it as an insurance policy in case the scientists are right. The scientists were right. Reagan and his approach worked. Secretary Shultz asks, Why not take out an insurance policy and approach climate change the Reagan way?  Rubio: Because were not going to destroy our economy the way the left-wing government that we are under now wants to do. Were not going to. ... Tapper: Im citing (Republican) George Shultz. Rubio: Well, and I dont  he may have lined up with their positions on this issue. But here is the bottom line. Every proposal they put forward are going to be proposals that will make it harder to do business in America, that will make it harder to create jobs in America. ... Maybe a billionaire here in California can afford an increase in their utility rates, but a working family in Tampa, Florida, or anywhere across this country cannot afford it. The obvious irony: Florida, Rubios state, is among the most vulnerable to rising seas, which are associated with the increase in global temperatures caused by humans. A recent study found that if we burned all available fossil fuels, Florida would be almost completely underwater. Rubio: Jake, you ... called me a denier. ... Tapper: I called you a skeptic. Rubio: OK, a skeptic. You can measure the climate. You can measure it. Thats not the issue were discussing. Here is what Im skeptical of. Im skeptical of the decisions that the left wants us to make, because I know the impact those are going to have and theyre all going to be on our economy. They will not do a thing to lower the rise of the sea. They will not do a thing to cure the drought here in California. But what they will do is they will make America a more expensive place to create jobs. From that exchange, maybe you get a sense of how difficult it is to answer reader Randy McNamaras question about where these presidential candidates stand on climate change. As the science about climate change become abundantly clear  the climate is warming, with potentially disastrous consequences, and human fossil fuel emissions are the main cause  U.S. presidential hopefuls have gotten better at dodging attempts to classify them. It seems none wants to be labeled a denier or a skeptic, even if their policies suggest otherwise. Rubio, who does acknowledge climate change is happening, actually has been very clear in the past. I do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate the way these scientists are portraying it, he told ABCs Jonathan Karl in 2014. Other candidates have made similar, anti-science statements and then later tried to soften their stances. The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese to make U.S. manufacturing noncompetitive, Donald Trump tweeted in November 2012. He later told Tapper on CNNs State of the Union that the tweet was meant to be sarcastic. But Trump also told Tapper he is not a huge believer in the global warming phenomena. ... This stuff is exhausting, right? There are several candidates  among them Democrats Hillary Clinton, Martin OMalley and Bernie Sanders as well as Republican Lindsey Graham  who have clearly stated that they acknowledge the reality of climate science and (crucially) would work to curb fossil fuel emissions. When 90% of the doctors tell you youve got a problem, do you listen to the one? Graham told CNNs Dana Bash on State of the Union in June. At the end of the day, I do believe that the CO2 emission problem all over the world is hurting our environment. But the solution is a pro-business solution to a lower-carbon economy. Id encourage the others to make their positions that clear. And Id ask journalists to continue to push, as Tapper did Wednesday, for more-specific statements on whether these candidates believe humans are causing climate change by burning fossil fuels, and, if so, what would they do about it. The American public, including McNamara, our reader in San Francisco, deserves a much higher level of discourse on this crucial topic. Question from Mark D., Raleigh, North CarolinaAnswer by Brandon Miller, meteorologist, CNN International Answer: We hear the term scientific consensus bantered about a lot when discussing climate change, and the 97% number  which refers to the percentage of active climate scientists who believe people are causing climate change by burning fossil fuels  is widely cited. Theres a NASA page dissecting and touting the figure. Even President Barack Obama tweeted it. But where does this number actually come from? And who are these 97% scientists? First, heres where the number comes from: There are a few studies and surveys that have found an overwhelming majority of scientists who study climate change agree that the climate is warming and that humans are responsible for it. One of the largest and most widely referenced studies was published in 2009 by Peter Doran and Maggie Kendall Zimmerman. These researchers polled more than 3,000 Earth scientists, asking them simply 1) if they believed that the planet was warming, and 2) if human activity was a significant contributor in changing the global temperature. The scientists came from a variety of fields within Earth science (geology, oceanography, paleontology and meteorology, to name a few). Ninety percent had Ph.D.s and 7% had masters degrees. Nine in 10 of the scientists said global temperatures are rising and 82% said this rise is because of human activities such as burning fossil fuels and putting more heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere. But they didnt stop there. To gauge the view of the scientists with the most expertise, the authors also looked specifically at responses from climate science experts  meaning those who published 50% of their research in that field. For that group, the consensus was even more striking. More than 97% agreed that humans are causing the Earths temperature to rise. Two: Five techniques of climate change denial Researchers keep getting similar results. An exhaustive review of published research on climate change was performed in a 2013 study by John Cook. The study looked at nearly 12,000 published studies over 20 years across a number of scientific, peer-reviewed journals containing the words global warming and global climate change. Of those studies, approximately one-third stated a position on whether climate change was caused by humans, and, of those who stated a position on that subject, 97.1% of the research showed humans are causing the climate to change. Mark D., the reader in North Carolina who asked about the 97%, also wanted to know, specifically, whether its fair to say climate scientists have a bias ... simply because theyre climate scientists. Its an interesting point, but its worth noting that science is dedicated to independent thinking. Scientists test, replicate and question their hypotheses. And, perhaps counterintuitively, theres actually an incentive for them to try to disprove deeply held scientific theories. They havent been able to do that for climate change. When people say scientists promote climate change to get grant money, it is an immediate sign they do not understand how grants are funded, Marshall Shepherd, director of the Atmospheric Sciences program at the University of Georgia, and publisher of research studies on climate change, wrote in an email. It would actually be in the best interest of scientists to say to a funding source, We dont know if human-caused climate change is happening, so fund us to figure it out.  Two: The most climate-skeptical place in America Scientists are trying to question our understanding of this subject, and science is all about cataloging ongoing discovery. But our very best understanding of the science overwhelmingly indicates that the climate is changing and that humans likely are to blame. Thats shown both in the research and among the views of experts in climate science. To wrap up, consider this: More than 200 scientific associations from all over the world, including the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the World Meteorological Organization and the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, all support this consensus.",11/09/2015,https://edition.cnn.com/2015/09/11/opinions/your-climate-questions-two-degrees/index.html
Were South Carolina floods ?aused?by climate change?,"The most common question I receive as an international news meteorologist is this: Was [insert major weather disaster here] caused by climate change? One of these questions recently came my way from Sital Sathia, who has been following CNNs Two Degrees series on climate change from Chicago. Sathia, who is an environmental policy student, phrased the question this way: Is climate change associated with the treacherous natural disasters we are currently experiencing? Attributing extreme weather events to climate change is one of the most important aspects of climate change research. Its also controversial. The reason for the latter: Its difficult to prove a single weather event was caused by humans burning fossil fuels and warming the planet. After all, extreme weather has occurred all over our planet long before humans started interfering with the climate system. But scientists are clear that some extreme weather events are influenced by global warming. How do we decide whats normal and whats not? Lets look at the recent example of historic flooding in the Southeast, particularly South Carolina and North Carolina. The record rains are blamed for the deaths of at least 19 people and hundreds of thousands were put under a boil-water advisory because of the contamination of water supplies. Was this flooding caused by climate change? We dont know for sure, at least not yet. More research is needed. But we know this event has the fingerprints of climate change all over it. This flooding contained a combination of several extreme weather events that we expect to occur more frequently as a result of global warming  including extreme precipitation (i.e. a lot of rain falling in a short amount of time) and coastal flooding. The South Carolina governor called the event a one-in-1000 year flood, which means that the likelihood of this type of event occurring in a given year is about 0.1%. But according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, these return periods are decreasing, and the more we warm the planet, the more likely these events are to occur. This is because the more the planet warms, the more water vapor the atmosphere can hold, adding more rain to big storms. Therefore, this 1-in-1000-year event may become more like a 1-in-100 year event. Indeed, we have seen numerous high-profile examples of these extreme rainfall events recently, including those in France, Japan and Boulder, Colorado. The flooding in South Carolina was worsened by coastal inundation, particularly in Charleston, where a combination of strong winds, partly associated with nearby Hurricane Joaquin, and high tides caused ocean water to flood much of the city. Once again, there is a clear climate change connection to this flooding, as sea levels in Charleston have risen a foot in the past century, according to NOAA, which clearly added to the destruction this storm system was able to bring. This gives us a clear example of how coastal cities are being affected by climate change, especially during extreme storms such as those we saw in New Jersey with Superstorm Sandy. The IPCC produced a special report specifically on the role climate change plays in extreme events. Extremes have changed as a result of anthropogenic influences, the panel says, including increases in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. But the level of confidence varies depending on the type of event or weather. This has to do with the rarity of the event (the rarer the event, the harder it is to attribute it to global warming because the historical dataset is very limited), and the complexity of the dynamics required to produce the event. Heavy rain events and coastal flooding are among the easiest to link to climate change. Heat waves and droughts are somewhat easy to link, but are more difficult. One recent study looked into the role climate change is playing the California drought and found that, while natural variability is the largest factor in the current drought, [manmade] warming has substantially increased the overall likelihood of extreme California droughts. They pin the actual percentage as up to 27% of the three-year drought being caused by climate change. As science advances, this type of climate detective work may get easier still.

Two Degrees: Does climate change contribute to disease?,"A reader asks: Does climate change trigger disease outbreaks? Climate change has both direct and indirect effects on illness and disease, says UGA professor of environmental health Erin Lipp is a professor of environmental health at the University of Georgia. She specializes in climate change and human health. Shes answering this weeks audience-generated climate change question as part of CNNs Two Degrees series. CNN reader Tiffany Dennis from Atlanta asks, could climate change lead to more disease outbreaks and infections? The simple answer is yes, says Erin Lipp, professor of environmental health at the University of Georgia. But the cause behind this increase is often more complex than other ways in which climate affects human health, Lipp says. For example, heat waves will result in more heat-related illnesses and deaths. This is a direct effect of climate change. Climate change has a more indirect effect on infectious diseases, with climate and shifts in weather patterns influencing the pathogens (bacteria, viruses, etc.) and their hosts (insects or other animals), and consequently how humans are exposed. Opinions: ISIS wont derail Paris climate talks Several diseases are sensitive to climate, among them diarrheal diseases and those transmitted by insect vectors. For example, the tick that carries the bacterium responsible for Lyme disease has expanded its range northward in the United States and Canada over the past 20 years due to warming temperatures, according to a 2012 study published in the Journal of Applied Ecology. Another example is the Vibrio bacterium. The pathogen is found naturally in warm marine waters and is responsible for diarrheal disease (and sometimes bloodstream poisoning) following consumption of raw oysters or wound infections after swimming in seawater. These bacteria also have expanded their range due to warming coastal waters. The turn of this century saw Vibrio outbreaks extend as far north as New England and Alaska. Records from northern Europe also indicate that these bacteria are becoming more common. Vibrio infections are now considered to be an indicator of climate change by the U.S. Global Change Research Program. In addition to temperature, changes in precipitation patterns can help to mobilize pathogens and increase the chances for transmission to humans. Intense rainfall events, flooding and drought  which are expected to increase with projected changes in climate  can affect the introduction of fecal contaminants to recreational waters or waters used for drinking. For example, nearly 70% of waterborne disease outbreaks in the United States were preceded by heavy rainfall events (in the 80th percentile) from 1948 to 1994. These events can cause runoff from agriculture lands or overflows in sewage systems that can transport pathogens to water bodies. Clearly there are many factors that ultimately affect infections and outbreaks, but climate change can add an additional level of risk.

Will we write Earth? next chapter or its obituary?,"Susan Goldberg: Each of us can fight climate change just by changing some of our daily habits Will we write a new chapter in the progress of humankind? Or will we write the obituary of Earth? When National Geographic first sent some of the worlds best photographers and mapmakers on assignment more than 125 years ago, we didnt set to capture the before photos for an imperiled planet. But thats exactly what happened. Over the decades, from the Matterhorn to the Great Barrier Reef to the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, these intrepid explorers became the visual record-keepers of climate change. Today, that record is alarmingly clear. Since the late 19th century, Earths average temperature has increased 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit, melting glaciers and raising sea levels. As President Barack Obama noted this year, shrinking ice caps forced National Geographic to make the biggest change in its atlas since the Soviet Union broke apart. Meanwhile, roughly a fifth of the Amazon rainforest, which stores a quarter of the worlds carbon found on land, has been destroyed over the past 40 years. In 1980, scientists logged 291 catastrophic floods, droughts, storms and other weather events; last year, that number tripled to 904. Humans are a highly adaptive species. Just ask Greenlands Inuits who, in the words of one anthropologist, went from subsistence hunting to Facebook in less than a century. But our adaptability has limits. Climate change is affecting nearly everything. Its displacing entire cultures, posing challenges to our health, weakening our economies and threatening our national security. The question we face as journalists who chronicle the state of the planet is stark: Will we write a new chapter in the progress of humankind? Or will we write the obituary of Earth? As world leaders meet in Paris this month for the U.N. Climate Change Conference, it appears, thankfully, that the years of dithering and denial finally may be behind us. While some leading presidential candidates continue to question the science and impact of climate change, recent polls show that three-quarters of Americans now acknowledge that climate change is happening. Pope Francis has called climate change one of the principal challenges facing humanity in our day. Ten of the largest oil and gas companies in the world, from BP to Shell to Saudi Aramco, have expressed support for climate reforms. It is critical that we build on this momentum. For all the talk of alternative energy technologies, ultimately, the most important source of energy is all of us. Thats why all of us  individuals, businesses and governments  have a responsibility to fix the problems we have caused. Take personal consumption. Its easy to assume that one person cant affect our warming world, and thats part of what makes climate change such a daunting issue to tackle. But one person can make a difference. Leaving your car at home twice a week can cut 2 tons of carbon emissions annually. If the average American family did laundry with cold water, that could save 1,600 pounds of CO2 a year. As for all the phone chargers and other electronics that we plug in and dont use? Those consume the equivalent of a dozen power plants, meaning that simply switching on and off a power strip could save your household up to $200 a year while also helping to save the planet. It just goes to show that when it comes to climate change, theres no such thing as chump change. At the same time, scientists, business leaders and entrepreneurs alike are realizing the benefits of a green economy, whether its major U.S. corporations saving millions by cutting energy use to nascent businesses selling solar lights to off-grid vendors in India and Myanmar. Currently, just 13% of electricity in the United States comes from renewable technology. But if American industry truly commits to this undertaking, the United States could be to the Age of Climate Change what we were for the Information Age  the driver and beneficiary of a revolutionary economy. Finally, governments need to galvanize a national and international response to this defining challenge of our time. Whoever takes the oath of office in 2017 will not only need to negotiate and adhere to strict limits on carbon emissions, but he or she will need to encourage Americas transformation into a sustainable society. Already, weve seen countries such as Germany lead the way, generating more than a quarter of its electricity from renewable sources. In the United States, policymakers at every level will be responsible for upgrading outdated infrastructure, building smarter cities and spurring the development of wind, solar and other renewable technologies. The United States already has increased the power generated by wind and solar 15-fold since 2003. With the right investments and the right leadership, Stanford engineer Mark Jacobson calculates that the United States could completely wean itself off fossil fuels by 2050. The message of magazines past and future is clear. One way or another, we inhabitants of Earth need to cool it. The choice  and the opportunity  is ours.

Climate change is a form of terror,"Four months and 1,300 miles ago, Erlend Moster Knudsen started running. Starting line: Arctic Norway. Destination: a U.N. climate change summit in Paris. I met the aerobically inclined climate scientist on the road last week in northern France. He ran (he is on his fourth pair of shoes) while I biked behind him, struggling to keep up. Freezing rain and snow pelted our faces as we traveled past misty fields, tile-roofed villages and Edward Scissorhands shrubbery. The whole thing was exhausting, but Knudsen, a 29-year-old with sandy hair, a scraggly beard and a Spandex-meets-DayGlo wardrobe, wasnt fazed by any of it. He seemed to thrive on the Fargo-like conditions. I love the snow! he said, darting up a hill. These are difficult times, as I dont need to remind you. ISIS is on everyones mind, especially here in France, where at least 130 people were killed in a recent terror attack. Fear cloaks this country like a persistent fog, and many observers worry that the threat of terror will infect the upcoming U.N. climate change summit, called COP21, which begins Monday in a Parisian suburb. But spending a day with Knudsen gave me a healthy dose of optimism in addition to sore thighs. Theres ample reason to believe the U.N. talks will help shove the world off of fossil fuels and toward a cleaner future. All we have to do is what Knudsen recommends: Put one foot in front of the other, remember why were here, and carry with us an important collection of stories. Like Knudsens past several months, my year has been a prelude to the Paris summit. But with, you know, less running. Ive spent most of 2015 taking your questions about climate change and turning them into stories as part of CNNs Two series. If youve been reading along, you know that 2 degrees Celsius is the number at the center of the upcoming Paris negotiations. Pretty much every country in the world has signed a treaty saying that 2 degrees Celsius of warming, measured since the Industrial Revolution, is all we can tolerate. Cross that line, and were expected to supercharge droughts, make storms more intense, commit low-lying islands to a watery death as seas rise, push millions more into poverty and put many plants and animals at risk of extinction. Its not an exact trigger point (1.9 degrees of warming is monumentally less catastrophic than 2.1 degrees, for instance), but diplomats had to draw a line in the sand. And everyone agrees that 2 degrees of warming is too much. Yet we dont act like it. Weve already warmed the climate about 1 degree Celsius. Were essentially locked into 1.5 degrees of warming based on all of the pollution weve pumped into the atmosphere, primarily by burning fossil fuels for heat and electricity. And pollution-reduction pledges logged by more than 140 countries in advance of the Paris talks promise to slow warming only to an estimated 2.7 degrees by the end of the century. Signs of warming abound: 2015 promises to be the hottest year on record; a heat wave in India killed 2,300 people this summer; air pollution is killing far more people all the time; floods in the United States likely have been made worse by higher-than-normal tides; theres evidence that a drought in Syria helped create conditions that led to the rise of ISIS. We humans, however, are excellent at ignoring long-term global problems  like climate change. We focus on whats right in front of us. The recent terror attacks are tragic, and many lives will never be the same because of them. They should not be minimized. But climate change is another form of terror  and its one were wreaking on ourselves. Can we avoid climate apocalypse? Being pessimistic about that is understandable, especially since previous attempts to use international politics to fix the climate problem largely have failed. Before I spent a day with the running climate scientist, I spoke with Yvo de Boer, former head of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the group that gets diplomats together to talk about the climate crisis. De Boer famously was moved to tears when a previous round of climate negotiations started to collapse. Theres a certain risk that political ambition trips over bureaucratic complexities, he told me by phone. There is this 50-odd-page document, which still contains many areas of disagreement. That stands between the beginning of the Paris conference and a successful outcome at the end. Very often at these conferences, the devil is in the detail. My worst-case scenario, he continued, is the one that we seem to see at almost every climate conference, which is that it needs to go into significant overtime. With 2 degrees on the horizon, theres no time for delay. Recently, there was much optimism ahead of the Paris climate talks. China and the United States, the worlds two biggest polluters, have pledged significant cuts in carbon pollution. The Obama administration rejected the Keystone XL pipeline, which was a symbolic boost for efforts to get the world off of dirty fuels like oil and coal. The Pope has been helping people finally see climate change as a moral crisis, one that will hit the worlds poor the hardest. And solar power is getting much cheaper. But along came ISIS. Now, massive public demonstrations at COP21 have been canceled, and a malaise hangs over the entire process. COP21: Police, protestors clash in Paris as world leaders arrive Knudsen, the running climate scientist, thought about abandoning his Pole to Paris journey because of the terror attacks on November 13. He canceled public events hed planned in Brussels, and he knows that his arrival in Paris probably will be met with little fanfare. Hed imagined hundreds of people running with him into the French capital. Now hes not sure whether his arrival, probably later this week, he told me, will be noticed by much of anybody (You can follow his progress on the Pole to Paris website, as well as the path of a colleague biking from New Zealand). When I met him in Maubeuge, France, on November 23, he gave a talk to a room of 50 chairs, all but six of them empty. Its clear the worlds attention was elsewhere. In pictures: Climate protests around the world Great weather! Knudsen yelled back at me as we crested a snowy hill. He did that kind of thing all day. He somehow found energy to grin constantly and cheer me on while I sweated through six layers of clothing, struggling to do once, on a bike, what he does daily on foot. He told me hes always been drawn to extremely remote, cold places, which I guess makes sense for a Norwegian guy who studies the Arctic. His unyielding optimism could be annoying if it werent so genuine. It starts to become contagious. By the end of the day, I found myself happily swishing through puddles on the bike, trying to give back some encouragement to Knudsen and two friends  Zoe Favart, 25; and Oria Jamar de Bolsee, 24  who were joining him on this part of his European expedition. His sunny demeanor has a clear source. Each morning, before lacing up his shoes and putting on still-wet clothes from the day before, Knudsen asks himself two questions: Whats the goal of the day? And Why am I doing this? The answer to the first question often is fairly obvious: Today I want to survive, give an interesting presentation or tolerate a pesky CNN crew. The answer to the second is more interesting. It usually has something to do with the people Knudsen has met en route. Like Laila Inga, an indigenous woman in the Arctic who, he told me, is having trouble surviving as a reindeer herder because of changes in the climate. The snow is melting and refreezing more often, he said, making it difficult for reindeer to nuzzle through the ice to reach the vegetation hiding below. Knudsen feels a responsibility to carry Ingas story to Paris. I feel similarly obliged to be a vessel for stories from the front lines after visiting, on your behalf, places that will be destroyed by 2 degrees of warming (the Marshall Islands) as well as those helping us beat that goal (a reservation in Montana). I hope someone in Paris is ready to listen.

Officials from around the world reach climate change draft agreement,"NEW: World leaders and activists urge a firm commitment to making a differenceGovernment officials will work next week in Paris to get a complete, final agreementMany have called for action, though getting everyone on the same page is a challenge Negotiators from 195 countries agreed Saturday on a blueprint deal aimed at reducing global carbon emissions and limiting global warming, a significant but far from conclusive step in the multinational effort to keep climate change in check. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) posted on its website a copy of the draft agreement, which officials have been working on intensively for some time. The document addresses deforestation, food security, poverty and a host of other issues, with chunks of the document focused on what developed countries can do to reduce carbon dioxide missions by a yet to be determined level by 2050. This includes what they can do to help other countries. To this point, one line in the draft states, Developed countries shall provide developing countries with long-term, scaled-up, predictable, new and additional finance, technology and capability-building. Officials will now work through next week at the COP21 conference in Paris to craft a complete, final agreement. Doing so may not be easy, but that didnt stop those involved in the process from celebrating Saturdays announcement. One more step in writing of history, tweeted Christiana Figueres, the executive secretary of the UNFCCC. #ADP adopts the Draft Paris Outcome and forwards it to #COP21 for finalizing. Saturdays announcement comes days after leaders from around the world  including Russian President Vladimir Putin, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and German Chancellor Angela Merkel  gathered in the French capital for the conferences kickoff. At the time, U.S. President Barack Obama expressed optimism that a deal would be struck. I think were going to solve it, Obama said. I think the issue is just going to be the pace and how much damage is done before we are able to fully apply the brakes. Many officials have talked about the importance of doing something to slow the pace of global climate change, aiming specifically to hold global average temperatures short of a 2 degrees Celsius increase over pre-industrial global temperatures. Having legally binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions has long been seen as a priority to make this happen. But getting every country in the world on the same page  since even a few bad eggs could tilt the scales in the wrong direction, even if everyone else is doing their part  has proven difficult over the years. Its also complicated to implement measures that have effective consequences for those who dont do their part. Making sense of the UN climate conferences acronyms In comments posted Saturday to Twitter, Figueres gave a sense of urgency and optimism to this challenge when she said, We can. We must. We will act on climate change. Segolene Royal, Frances environmental minister, added that its not that people dont know what has to be done. They just need the will  politically and otherwise  to make it happen. We have the solutions to climate change, Royal said, according to another U.N. tweet. We just need to deploy them. This sentiment was echoed by U.S. astronaut Kjell Lindgren, who expressed hope that leaders from around the world will find common ground from his current home on the International Space Station. Whether youre a government, a business, a university or an individual, you can make a difference, he said. Back on Earth, in Paris, several speakers  including current Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo and former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg  similarly rallied people to the cause Saturday, which the U.N. characterized as Action Day. One of the speakers, actor Sean Penn, said, If theres something to move forward with forests, to reclaim the environment, to create economic opportunity and to protect these vital human rights, its in no longer being afraid to make commitments to do so. ... Join us ... in making a commitment and in being under the scrutiny of our children in 10 years from today.

Obama: Climate agreement ?est chance we have?to save the planet,"NEW: ""I believe this moment can be a turning point for the world,"" Obama saysThe final draft of the agreement reached at the Paris climate talks has been acceptedScientists and environmental activists respond with cautious optimism President Barack Obama praised a landmark climate change agreement approved Saturday in Paris, saying it could be a turning point for the world. The Paris agreement establishes the enduring framework the world needs to solve the climate crisis, the President said, speaking from the White House. It creates the mechanism, the architecture, for us to continually tackle this problem in an effective way. He praised American leadership but noted that all participating nations will have to cooperate. I believe this moment can be a turning point for the world, Obama said, calling the agreement the best chance we have to save the one planet that weve got. Though the plan was hailed as a milestone in the battle to keep Earth hospitable to human life, critics say it is short on specifics, such as how the plan will be enforced or how improvements will be measured. The accord achieved one major goal. It limits average global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial temperatures and strives for a limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) if possible. The agreement, put together at the 21st Conference of Parties, or COP21, doesnt mandate exactly how much each country must reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. Rather, it sets up a bottom-up system in which each country sets its own goal  which the agreement calls a nationally determined contribution  and then must explain how it plans to reach that objective. Those pledges must be increased over time, and starting in 2018 each country will have to submit new plans every five years. Many countries actually submitted their new plans before climate change conference, known as COP21, started last month  but those pledges arent enough to keep warming below the 2-degree target. But the participants hope is that over time, countries will aim for more ambitious goals and ratchet up their commitments. Another sticking point has been coming up with a way to punish nations that dont do their part, but observers say that was never really on the table. Instead, the agreement calls for the creation of a committee of experts to facilitate implementation and promote compliance with the agreement, but it wont have the power to punish violators. Another issue, according to observers, was whether there would be compensation is paid to countries that will see irreparable damage from climate change but have done almost nothing to cause it. The agreement calls for developed countries to raise at least $100 billion annually in order to assist developing countries. Members of the scientific and environmental activist communities responded with varying degrees of optimism. This didnt save the planet, Bill McKibben, the co-founder of 350.org, said of the agreement. But it may have saved the chance of saving the planet. Jennifer Morgan of the World Resources Institute anticipated a historic agreement that marks a turning point in the climate crisis. Even though the text has been agreed upon, theres still much more that needs to be done before the agreement goes into effect. The agreement was adopted by consensus during the meeting of government ministers. That doesnt necessarily mean all 196 parties approved it; French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, who served as the president of the conference, had the authority to decide if a consensus had been reached. Individual countries now must individually ratify or approve the agreement in their respective countries. And the agreement wont enter into force until 55 countries have ratified it. Those nations must account for 55% of total global greenhouse gas emissions. That means if the worlds biggest polluters dont authorize the agreement, enacting it could prove challenging. China and the United States, respectively, account for about 24% and 14% of total greenhouse gas emissions, according to the World Resources Institute. A senior administration official told CNN that Congress doesnt have to vote on the plan. This agreement does not require submission to the Senate because of the way it is structured, he said. The targets arent binding. The pieces that are binding are already part of existing agreements, the official said. One leading Republican criticized the agreement, saying it will place emissions restrictions on American industry while requiring the United States to give money to undeveloped nations. Once again, this administration is all too eager for the international community to review its commitments before even revealing those commitments to the American people, said Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. The United States has backed off full support of climate change measures in the past. The Kyoto Protocol on reducing greenhouse gas emissions was adopted in 1997. The Clinton administration signed the agreement but, fearing defeat, never submitted it to the Senate for ratification. In China, the Standing Committee of the National Peoples Congress is in charge of approving treaties. From Xie Zhenhua, Chinas chief COP21 negotiator, said, Although this deal is not entirely perfect and contains some content that needs to be improved, this doesnt prevent us from taking a historic step ahead. The agreement calls for a signature ceremony in April 2016, and requests that the U.N. Secretary-General keep the agreement open for signing until April 2017. Fabius released the draft worked out by negotiators Saturday morning. Later in the day, world leaders or their representatives approved it. A crowd erupted in applause once the agreements adoption was announced. Leaders around the world praised passage of the agreement. A month ago tomorrow, Paris was the victim of the deadliest terror attack in Europe for more than a decade, British Prime Minister David Cameron wrote in a Facebook post. Today, it has played host to one of the most positive global steps in history. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon hailed the draft. We must protect the planet that sustains us, Ban said. For that we need all hands on deck. In the streets of Paris, outside the conference, protesters demanded action. #ParisAgreement was trending on Twitter. Nous sommes la nature qui se defend! read one tweet, with a photo of one person dressed as a polar bear and another dressed as a penguin. We are nature that defends itself. Some demonstrators felt differently  they called the agreement insufficient and chanted its a crime against humanity. We have a 1.5-degree wall to climb, but the ladder isnt tall enough, Kumi Naidoo of Greenpeace said at a press conference. He did call the agreement a new imperative and positive step. Capping the increase in global average temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius was organizers key goal going into the COP21. That level of warming is measured as the average temperature increase since the Industrial Revolution. If that temperature threshold is not reached, the result may be superdroughts, deadlier heat waves, mass extinctions of plants and animals, megafloods and rising seas that could wipe some island countries off the map. The only way to reach the threshold, scientists say, is to eliminate fossil fuels. Scientists and policy experts say hitting the 2 degrees Celsius threshold would require the world to move off fossil fuels between about 2050 and the end of the century. To reach the more ambitious 1.5 degrees Celsius goal, some researchers say the world will need to reach zero net carbon emissions sometime between about 2030 and 2050.",12/12/2015,https://edition.cnn.com/2015/12/12/world/global-climate-change-conference-vote/index.html
There? no time to delay action on climate change,"We know whats required to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change, including super droughts, mass extinctions and underwater coastal cities: We need to ditch fossil fuels by 2050. That may sound like a distant target, but think about what a world without fossil fuels would look like: No coal, no natural gas, no oil. Or very little of these things, which now are staples of the global economy (even if a salmon is worth more than a barrel of oil these days). Mid-century is only 34 years away, which is one Beyonce-in-2016-sized lifetime from now. Thats enough time for enormous transformation and progress to take place (witness: Beyonce) but not enough that we can let ourselves doddle in the dirty-energy status quo. The urgency of the climate crisis is exactly why this weeks news that the U.S. Supreme Court temporarily blocked a key climate change rule is so disheartening. At question is the Obama administrations Clean Power Plan, which aims to significantly reduce pollution from power plants, especially those burning coal. SCOTUS voted 5-4 to stop the plan from being implemented until lower courts have time to review legal challenges to the policy. In other words: They stalled its implementation at a time when every month truly matters for our global march to a zero-greenhouse-gas-emission future. That doesnt mean the plan will die. Lower courts will move the issue forward as soon as June. (This all started by the way because a number of short-sighted states sued over the implementation of the plan). But it certainly does take wind out of the sails of U.S. climate change efforts. And all of this is to say nothing about what could happen to the plan if a climate-skepic Republican is elected as president in November. Climate activists have been quick to say the SCOTUS decision is only a bump in the road, and that the transition to cleaner fuel sources, like wind and solar, is irrevocable. But blocking the Clean Power Plan would send a massive symbolic blow to the worlds efforts to cut emissions and meet international targets for fighting global warming. In December, nearly 200 countries agreed to a U.N.-led plan to hold warming well below 2 degrees Celsius, which is measured as a temperature increase since the Industrial Revolution. To do that, the world has to get to zero net carbon emissions sometime between about 2050 and 2080. One key reason the Paris Agreement succeeded where many others failed is that the worlds two biggest polluters  China and the United States  both proposed ambitious pollution cuts. What the United States brought to the table to get China on board is the commitment to domestic action through the Clean Power Plan, said Anthony Hobley, CEO of Carbon Tracker Initiative, a London-based financial think tank that analyzes climate action. The rest of the world will be watching, he said. All climate change policies should be judged on how quickly they help the world get to zero net carbon emissions, and avoid 2 degrees Celsius of warming. The Clean Power Plan is far from a panacea, but it is essential to these international goals. Without this policy, it would become virtually impossible for the U.S. to catch up and achieve reductions consistent with the objective agreed in Paris of holding warming well below 2 degrees Celsius, said Marcia Rocha, project leader of the Climate Action Tracker, which measures the efficacy of plans to combat climate change. Not implementing the Clean Power Plan, she said in an email, would set the U.S. emissions to rise until 2025 (and 2030) and hence in the opposite direction of where they need to be heading. I do agree with climate-action advocates and economists who say the shift away from coal is happening regardless of policies like the Clean Power Plan. Theres always hope. Saying, as Wired did in a headline on Wednesday, that the Supreme Court may have nuked the Paris climate deal is hyperbolic. For one, the court decision is not yet final. And another: More than two dozen coal companies have declared bankruptcy in the last three years, according to the Carbon Tracker Initiative. That happened in part because of existing clean-air regulations, but moreover because of the cheap price of natural gas, which is out-competing coal. The trend line is only moving one way  away from coal and toward cleaner energy. But we must move as quickly as possible, and, absent a price on carbon pollution, the Clean Power Plan helps America do that. It helps us avoid the worst of climate change, supports clean energy economies also promotes public heath. (Air pollution kills more than 3 million people worldwide every year, according to the World Health Organization.) World leaders get this. So does the Obama administration. So do citizens of the United States. Majorities of the public in 23 of the 27 states suing the EPA (over the Clean Power Plan) actually support setting strict carbon dioxide emission limits on coal-fired power plants to reduce global warming and improve public health, according to the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication. If only those states would listen to the science and their citizens. Its in their interest  all of ours  to speed our way toward a cleaner, safer future. Add John D.

So ?was that climate change?,"Scientists are learning how to tie a particular storm, drought, flood or heat wave to Earth's long-term warming trendA researcher in the Netherlands says global warming may have helped cause February's abnormal warmingAnother says evidence shows that man-made warming worsened California's drought Like any good detective, Park Williams asks good questions. As a third-grader, for instance, the now-34-year-olds family took him on a road trip across the Rocky Mountains. He had to know: Why did the trees stop growing at a certain elevation? Why were there plants on one side of a mountain and desert on the other? In fifth grade, he heard a radio broadcast. A weatherman predicted that a drought in Northern California, where he grew up, would last for five more years. How did he know that? What sort of magical person was this who could somehow see into the future? Its perfectly fitting, then, that Williams, who now is a mussy-haired, unassuming climatologist at the Tree Ring Lab of Columbia Universitys Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, would be among a group of pioneering climate change sleuths who are trying to answer a critical and, until recently, unanswerable question: Was that climate change? Think of it as detective work for the fossil fuel era. Its climate forensics. While the broad trends of climate change, and our role in causing it primarily by burning fossil fuels, have been clear for decades, it was impossible until recently to tie a particular storm, drought, flood or heat wave to the long-term warming trend. Thankfully, thats changing. The days of saying no single weather event can be linked to climate change are over, said Heidi Cullen, chief scientist at the nonprofit Climate Central and a thought leader on this issue. For many extreme weather events, the link is now strong. Take the heat record that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration confirmed Thursday, for example. February 2016 was the most abnormally hot month in the history of weather records, which date back to 1880. But its just one month, right? Could it be a fluke? Well, theres actually an answer. Talk to Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, a climate researcher at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute, and hell tell you that, based on preliminary data from NASA, 0.9 to 1 degree Celsius of the abnormal warming seen in February came from global warming. Far less than that  0.2 to 0.3 degrees  is the fault of El Nino. So, yes. That was mainly us. And thats a relatively easy mystery to solve. Harder is pinning a specific weather event in a specific location on fossil fuel pollution. Thats where Williams comes in. His focus: drought. I visited him at Columbias Tree Ring Lab, which is upriver from Manhattan on a beautiful and wooded stretch of the Hudson River, to try to figure out how this works. The answer has something to do with the slivers of tree trunks that are packed into a closet in the lab. Theyre thinner than a pencil and much longer, drilled from tree trunks from places as far-flung as Pakistan, Indonesia and Alaska. Theyre filed into tiny drawers. Tree rings are a tool to travel back in time and understand how bad droughts can get, Williams told me. Each ring is an annual weather record. Wet years are fat rings; dry years thin. Researchers at the Tree Ring Lab are working to create an atlas of droughts around the world  when and where they happened, and how bad they were. This context helps climate sleuths like Williams decide how current droughts fit into the historical record. The more we know, the better we can say whats normal or abnormal now. (Other climate attribution researchers use computer models to simulate events with and without the presence of human-produced carbon dioxide in the atmosphere). One of Williams most recent cases: The 2012-to-2015 California drought. That drought, which cost the state $2.7 billion last year alone, was about a fifth more severe because of global warming, he found. You can do a little math and put that another way: About 17% of the drought was our fault. To get those numbers, Williams used computers and the historical climate record to dissect the drought into components like temperature, wind, precipitation and evaporation. A lack of precipitation  which he doesnt blame on humans  was the main driver of drought. But climate models show that California was hotter than it otherwise would have been during that period because weve polluted the atmosphere with carbon dioxide. So that extra heat didnt cause the drought, but it was enough to increase its severity. Sitting on a bouncy ball in front of his office computer, Williams pulled up two maps of California to make his point. On the left was reality: 39% of the state saw record-breaking drought, the worst of it represented with a wine-colored blob on screen. On the right, the counterfactual case, without carbon pollution. Only 29% of the state would have seen record drought. The wine-colored blob was slightly smaller. Among the areas hit harder because of global warming was the San Joaquin Valley, which produces much of the nations food crop (and in which I spent a lot of time in 2014). That small difference in temperature matters a lot out there. Williams grew up just north of that valley, near Folsom Lake, which became a symbol of the Western drought when it was reduced to just a puddle, as he described it to me. He told me he remembers driving across that lakes dam to get to elementary school as a child. He saw lake levels that were crazy-low then. Drought long has been a reality in the American West. But hes always curious: Are things different now? Why? How much? Science hasnt answered these questions with perfect precision. These findings, including Williams assessment of the drought, are the subject of debate. (The science of long-term climate change at the global level, meanwhile, is not; 97% of climate scientists agree were causing it, and our understanding is solid). But better computing power and knowledge of the historical climate are helping advance this type of climate attribution research. Theres, of course, a chance that lawyers will grab hold of these concepts and try to sue polluters over the effects of climate change. Yet that might not be such a bad idea. Theres ample blame when it comes to global warming. All of us in the industrialized world are at fault. But the more powerful concept may be the one that also seems to drive Williams: understanding. If we use climate forensics to understand how were changing the planet, then we might also wake up to the fact that there are proven and simple fixes to this crisis. Our fingerprints are all over the weather these days. Im thankful science is starting to show us exactly where. Add John D. Sutter on Snapchat. Follow his Facebook posts.

"Changing opinions on climate change, from a CNN meteorologist","Although climate change is thought of as simply a political football, it has been a heated topic among meteorologists for years. I, for one, have changed my conclusion over time on whether humans are responsible for the increased heat content of the Earth. I write this article not to change your mind about global warming; I simply want to show you why I changed mine. Early in my scientific studies at Nebraska, most believed that humans could never pollute this massive globe enough to make a measurable difference. As a student, I learned to never exclude any possibility until ultimately that possibility is proven false. It was called skepticism, not denial, and skepticism is a key foundation of the scientific process. In the 80s and 90s there seemed to be many other potential causes of climate change, not only humans. Volcanoes, solar fluctuations, city heat-islands, concrete production and yes, even the cattle population. The list went on and on and seemed endless. I wondered if all these potential causes were given adequate consideration? We also thought the ocean might be in more trouble, because it absorbs the CO2 and creates carbonic acid and changes the waters pH. In 2009 an American Meteorological Society survey showed that only 24% of on-air meteorologists agreed with the statement, Most of the warming since 1950 is VERY LIKELY human induced. I did not agree because I did not like the term VERY LIKELY. I did not yet have the entire picture. I had not excluded all other possibilities. I wasnt denying human-caused climate change, but I remained skeptical. 2010 was a turning point for me. That year was the hottest year on record, even though there was a La Nina present, a process that should have cooled the planet. Down went the other potential causes: There were no volcanoes producing huge amounts of CO2. The sun was not getting hotter. Satellite-derived temperature readings ruled out the heat-island effect. Even The Pause (the so-called period post-1998 that showed very little warming of the planet for about 15 years) had been shattered. They are all now called zombie theories, long since debunked myths about climate change that skeptics will continually bring up to counter the facts of man-made climate change. Then in 2013 the CO2 concentration crossed 400 parts per million and I knew the globe was in trouble. No longer was I only concerned with ocean acidification, it seemed the ocean was not capable of absorbing the massive quantities of CO2 that humans were emitting. The plants were not absorbing CO2 fast enough through photosynthesis and converting it to oxygen. I was no longer a skeptic. Humans were polluting the atmosphere to a point of no return. I had finally excluded all other possibilities. Had I flip-flopped? Well, that is what it would be called in politics. But in science, it is just an evolution of understanding. I concluded that my original theory of it could be something else wasnt likely the case. As I tell my 11-year-old, Its OK to be wrong as long as you learn from your mistakes. The records continue to be shattered every year. The 15 hottest years on record have been since 2001 except for 1998. 2016 will likely be the hottest year on record, breaking the old record set in 2015, and the beat goes on. With each year, with each major disaster, it becomes harder to be a skeptic of man-made climate change  and that is why I am not one.",24/08/2016,https://edition.cnn.com/2016/08/24/opinions/chad-myers-climate-change-weather/index.html
Trump won? deter us on climate change,"Gemedo Dalle: ""Limiting global warming to below 1.5 degrees Celsius can and must be done""New research affirms transformational impact of keeping warming below 2 degrees, he says Even the recent outcome of the US elections cannot stop those of us dedicated to battling climate change. No country has said it will walk away from global action. To the contrary, countries including China, members of the European Union, Japan and Saudi Arabia have all reconfirmed their commitment to implement the Paris Agreement. Others, such as Australia, Pakistan and Italy, have even joined the agreement in the days since the US elections. French President Francois Hollande and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon have called on President-elect Trump to drop his campaign pledge to cancel the Paris Agreement; Ban called the Paris Agreement unstoppable. Together they send a resounding message: The countries of the world will forge on. Those that do will be better off by skipping all the downsides of a 19th century development model characterized by the burning of fossil fuels to achieve economic growth, while cashing in on more jobs, more growth and a higher quality of work and life. Climate change poses an existential threat to vulnerable countries around the world. Inaction in the face of worsening climate shocks risks moving the UNs Sustainable Development Goals beyond our reach. Tackling climate change, on the other hand, presents opportunities. The case for highly ambitious efforts on climate change is now so compelling that addressing global warming is no longer about burden sharing on emission cuts. It is now about securing the most benefits by taking action. When the world came together to produce the Paris Agreement in December 2015, all nations agreed to limit warming to well below 2 degrees. In that pact, now already in force, we committed to pursue efforts to ensure temperatures would even be half a degree lower at just 1.5 degrees, only just above the warming we have experienced to date. Half a degree Celsius  it doesnt sound like much, but it is a number that could transform the face of the world as we know it. At the first global talks after the Paris Agreement, held in Marrakech, Morocco, this month, we are presenting new research from the United Nations Development Program, and science and policy institute Climate Analytics, as commissioned by the more than 40 member countries of our Climate Vulnerable Forum. The report, the Low Carbon Monitor, demonstrates with great clarity just how much of a difference half a degree can make. If we pass 1.5, new weather extremes will gravely imperil countries like the Maldives and the Marshall Islands as well as large, populated low-lying territories in Bangladesh, Vietnam and Egypt, with sure-fire submergence under rising seas. Going beyond 1.5 degrees of warming means the virtual disappearance of the worlds coral reefs within the lifetime of most people alive today. It would also increase heatwave spells for multiple regions by an entire month yearly and raise risks of crop yield losses for key breadbasket areas of Africa and Central America by 10-15% in the coming decades. Keeping warming down also does more than reduce risk; its benefits can save lives. Greenhouse gas emission controls will help tackle the problem of air pollution, which already causes more deaths than alcohol or tobacco. The need to curb emissions also motivates expansion of renewable energy. Current policies would still leave over 1 billion people without electricity by 2030. In fact, to achieve universal access to energy 14 years from now, 60% of new energy must come outside of traditional grids. The logistical and infrastructure advantages of renewable energy are plain for all to see. The required action to keep us below 1.5 is just too ambitious, some say. Well, Costa Rica has gone more than 200 days in the past year with 100% of its energy production derived from renewable sources. In fact, it is possible that keeping warming below 1.5 degrees might spur greater economic growth. According to the new estimates released in the report, it could raise global economic output by $12 trillion by 2050 in particular because countries would avoid so many of the devastating impacts associated with higher levels of warming. The benefits of tackling climate change can also be passed on to workers. Producing energy from coal or oil creates the least possible jobs, whereas sustainable biomass or renewable hydro-energy have among the highest employment contributions. Ambitious climate policies could thereby double global energy jobs come 2050. For all to have access to these benefits, the least developed, low- and middle-income developing countries like Ethiopia, Costa Rica or the Philippines still require partnerships with more advanced countries, investors and industrial pioneers to access new clean energy technologies, to bridge investment shortfalls when they leave the polluting carbon path, and to develop skills and know-how that remain the domain of large and advanced economies. Renewable energy costs are already substantially lower than just a few years ago. Already they are competing at cost with carbon-intensive energy in a low-price oil market still distorted by hundreds of billions of dollars of fossil fuel subsidies. According to the Low Carbon Monitor report, if all embrace low emissions development, renewable energy could be five times cheaper or more by 2050, a vision of a low-cost energy future we believe everyone wants and deserves. Limiting global warming to below 1.5 degrees Celsius can and must be done. We will make it happen not just to survive, but also to thrive.",16/11/2016,https://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/16/opinions/wont-quit-on-climate-change-dalle-opinion/index.html
"Back to the beginning: The sweat lodge ceremony, as intended","Smoke curls toward the sky as the sitting elder lifts the sacred pipe, lowers it to the ground and moves it around him. Hes recognizing the Creator, honoring Mother Earth and calling on spirits to lend support. Ancient songs and drumbeats fill the simple dome-like structure. Constructed of gray willow branches and covered in black canvas, it sits low to the ground. The flap over the entry we crawled through has been closed, ushering in darkness. Medicinal water infused with juniper is poured over the red-hot rocks in a pit at the center. Fifteen of us sit on the ground, encircling this only source of heat. The temperature rises, and together we go back to the beginning. Ive come to Canada to experience an authentic sweat lodge ceremony under the guidance of an internationally respected teacher. The sweat lodge, he says, represents a return to our mothers womb, and the rhythm of the drums is her heartbeat. The water and steam are meant to purify those who enter, allowing each of us to emerge reborn. That is the basic intention of the sweat ceremony, an indigenous custom thats been preserved for thousands of years by Native Americans and Canadas First Nations people. The ancient practice is meant to birth new life. That may have been the objective when James Arthur Ray, then a self-help guru, led 55 people into a sweat lodge near Sedona, Arizona, in October 2009. Instead, three participants died after spending hours inside. Nineteen others were hospitalized. Ray, who was sentenced to two years in prison for felony negligent homicide, is now free and attempting to reinvent himself. His story is the subject of CNN Films Enlighten Us: The Rise and Fall of James Arthur Ray, which premieres Saturday at 8 p.m. ET on CNN. According to Native American and First Nations elders, Ray offered a gift that wasnt his to share. He put a price tag on that which shouldnt be sold, charging people nearly $10,000 for a four-day spiritual warrior retreat that culminated in the sweat lodge disaster. If you appropriate something that doesnt belong to you, theres a consequence, says elder Dave Courchene Jr., 66, who leads our sweat lodge ceremony. Im not opposed to having people, having anyone, experience the ceremony in the lodges that we do. I welcome that. But what I will not relinquish is the right of leadership. That right to lead ceremonies is one he earned only after years of learning and searching. Courchene grew up north of Winnipeg on the Sagkeeng First Nation reserve (the preferred term for reservation in Canada), at a time when the Canadian government prohibited the spiritual practices that defined his people. Missionaries imposed their own beliefs, and efforts at forced assimilation took a national toll. Even though he descends from a line of chiefs, he says, he, too, was robbed of the knowledge passed on by his ancestors. As a child, he didnt attend ceremonies, hear the drums or the ancient songs. As we drive along a nearby road, he points to where the local residential, or boarding, school once stood. Young First Nations children often were plucked from their families and their traditions. They faced punishment if they dared to speak their language. And accounts of sexual and physical abuse ran rampant. Residential schools like this one dotted the Canadian landscape, starting in the 1930s. They were funded by the government and run by churches. The last one closed in the mid-1990s. The intent was to get rid of the Indian, Courchene explains. To educate the Indian to think and be like the colonizer themselves. His father was feared by the churches, Courchene says, and managed to keep him out of the residential school. But Courchene grew up haunted by the stories others shared and wasnt immune to attempts at assimilation at the government-run day school he attended. He also experienced discrimination firsthand. He couldnt sit with the white kids in the local movie theater. If he was standing in line in a store and a white person showed up, he had to step aside. In hospitals, his people were relegated to a separate section. All this stoked a fury that simmered inside him, one that began to bubble up in the politicized environment of the 1970s, he says, when indigenous people began to find their voices. He had the foresight to turn to a grandmother  the term used for elders who are women. She saw right through him. Ill never forget what she said to me, he says. You have a lot of anger in you, and that is not the way to live. With anger, you will darken your heart, and you will poison your blood. We want you to have a free spirit, but that spirit has to be grounded with values that make you a good human being. So we will begin by taking you to the beginning. He was in his early 20s when he took his first step into a sweat lodge. This was the beginning of my journey, Courchene says. It was the beginning of knowing who I was. In the years that followed he would learn from countless elders, participate in a multitude of ceremonies and spend days at a time on vision quests, during which hed fast and hope to discover his purpose. On one quest 35 years ago, he received the vision that became his lifes work: to share ancient indigenous teachings. In 2002, with the help of donations and the sweat of volunteers, he built the Turtle Lodge, a rustic and secluded educational center. It sits on the Sagkeeng First Nation reserve, about a 90-mile drive from Winnipeg, in a region thats been home to the Anishinaabe people for longer than can be measured. Shaped like a turtle, the symbol of truth for First Nations people, the center smells of pine. Hand drums hang on poles, and sacred eagle feathers dangle from rafters. Symbolic artwork decorates the circular walls. Here, people young and old, indigenous and otherwise, from places near and far, have benefited from knowledge keepers. Anywhere from 1,500 to 2,000 people pass through each year to attend ceremonies and learn from elders. They come to soak in teachings at no cost. Its the sort of safe space Courchene wished was available when he was growing up. Today, in the Anishinaabe language, hes known as Nii Gaani Aki Inini (Leading Earth Man). He has shared stages with the likes of the Dalai Lama, addressed the United Nations and spoken at international summits. Hes traveled the globe leading ceremonies and sharing his peoples wisdom. A totem pole stands at the entrance of the Turtle Lodge property. It was a gift from the Lummi Nation, a Native American tribe in Washington state. It arrived earlier this year after traveling across North America  Turtle Island to native peoples  to receive their stories. It even stopped at Standing Rock, the reservation where protesters (who call themselves water protectors) have gathered to try to block the Dakota Access Pipeline. On a recent Friday morning, several hundred visitors stream past the totem pole and into the Turtle Lodge for a free one-day gathering hosted by the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs. The topic is climate change. Parked cars are scattered across the frozen muddy grounds, between the totem pole and portable toilets (there are no bathrooms inside). Tomorrow, when the visitors are gone, Courchene will head to a nearby health center to lead me and others in the sweat ceremony. But for now, hes preparing for this larger gathering. Those who arrive have answered invitations, coming from cities as close as Winnipeg and as far as Ottawa, Canadas capital more than 2,000 miles away. They are judges and politicians in suits, and academics and environmental activists in jeans. They serve on energy boards, represent nonprofits and work for an oil pipeline company. They are students of all ages and persuasions, and they take their seats in peace and prayer. Young men from local First Nations communities sit in a circle, singing and beating on drums. Theyre bringing the session to order and, they trust, lifting its message to the universe. The crowd stands from their folding chairs in reverence as elders light their pipes to invoke the presence of ancestors. A sacred fire burns outside the lodge, providing a doorway to the spirits. Songs during a water ceremony honor that which is sacred and is life. Courchene and the others impart lessons from their ancestors, wisdom to help lead balanced lives and honor the land. Around them  in sculptures, on drums or in artwork  are reminders of the seven sacred laws or teachings, animals that represent what they hold most important. Among them are the turtle signifying truth, the buffalo for respect, an eagle for love, a bear for courage. The goal, according to the elders, isnt to impose beliefs on anyone but to be heard for what they have to offer. For too long their teachings were silenced, and here  standing in their place of strength and not in the halls of a government building  they can say their piece and speak up on behalf of Mother Earth. As the mother of life, Mother Earth gives birth, and gives us everything we need to live  the food, the water, the medicines, the clothing, the shelter, and most of all, the love, kindness and teachings that a mother gives to her child, Courchene tells the gathering. Hes reading from The Great Binding Law, a statement of responsibility penned by Manitoba elders last year. It resulted from concerns about climate change, talks about an oil pipeline coming through the territory and other environmental issues. It also came in response to political leaders who sought their counsel. Today it is printed on scrolls and distributed, a gift to everyone in the room. We are all in this together, Courchene continues. Today we call on all nations of the world to join us in the spirit of our original instructions to care for Mother Earth together, and find true peace. Helping to manage todays gathering is Dr. Sabina Ijaz, 43, a family physician who offers volunteer administrative help at the Turtle Lodge. She grew up in Toronto and moved to the area in 2002 so she could be closer to the sort of teachings that saved her life more than 20 years ago. Shed just finished her first year of undergraduate studies in Hamilton, Ontario, when a car wreck nearly robbed her of her dreams. She was a back-seat passenger, on her way to a wedding, when the vehicle rolled nine times down an embankment east of Toronto. Rescue workers had to use the Jaws of Life to extract her. Ijaz was left with a brain injury. She suffered from seizures, had difficulty concentrating and trouble with her memory. She returned to school and tried her best to keep up, but she couldnt  and dropped out. A friend who was in medical school was heading to a nearby reserve to take part in a workshop led by a traditional healer. Ijaz was intrigued and asked to come along. She grew enamored with what she saw and kept returning to learn more. Shed been raised by a Catholic mother and a Muslim father, and though shed found meaning in both traditions as a child, shed since put faith aside. The indigenous healer brought her back. She said to me, It doesnt matter how you pray. Theres only one Creator. He has many names and there are many ways to reach the Creator. The most important way to reach him is through your own heart. Ijaz began to pray again, and the depression that had weighed her down since the accident finally lifted. Then came the sweat lodge ceremony that changed everything. Two female healers in the sweat lodge worked on her, pouring sacred water on their hands and touching her head in the areas where she was having trouble. They prayed for her. They said the hot rocks represented grandfathers, and that their spirits had arrived to make her well. Afterward, she stood at the sacred fire outside and sprinkled tobacco into the flames, offering a prayer of gratitude to the Creator. Suddenly she could feel the wind blowing from the west. It rushed by and through her and, she says, took with it all that had ailed her. Standing outside the sweat lodge, my thoughts were like the wind, she recalls. They were completely free. When she saw her doctors later, she says, scans showed that the areas of her brain that had been injured were healed. She returned to school and got straight As. For a year afterward, shed wake up each morning at 4 a.m. and weep because she was so happy to have her life back. She went on to study medicine but never let go of what shed experienced. Ijaz saw in the indigenous people a highly evolved relationship with the natural world and the spiritual world, a connection with the sacredness of life that theyve maintained, in spite of all their suffering. That connection, however, is one that needs to be restored, especially for young indigenous people, Courchene and other elders say. Too many of their young people are city bound, walking on concrete instead of land. They are surrounded by violence, drugs and alcohol, not nature and animals. They spend more time looking at technology than they do the stars and the moon. They listen to loud music but not the wind. The struggles they face, including suicide rates that are five to seven times higher than nonindigenous Canadian youth, are seen as lasting repercussions from the residential schools, or what Courchene calls one of the darkest periods in our history. Many First Nations people were robbed of their identities, which left them lost and caused intergenerational suffering. They didnt know how to love children, he says, because they hadnt been shown love themselves. The Turtle Lodge offers a place for young people to glean the wisdom of their ancestors and reclaim what rightfully belongs to them. Its a mission that speaks to Erica Daniels, a Cree whose family originated from the Peguis First Nation. She was born, raised and still lives in Winnipeg but makes frequent trips to the Turtle Lodge. The 25-year-old filmmaker is the force behind a youth cultural program called Mikinack Gi Na Ma Kawin, or Turtle Teachings, which provides an entree for young people to connect with elders and stake a claim to their identities. I grew up very disconnected from the culture, and I always felt like a big part of me was missing, she says. It really affected me in my everyday life not knowing where I came from. She saw the poverty of indigenous people around her, the struggles with addiction, the rates of incarceration and suicide. She let the stereotypes of her people and their problems influence how she felt about herself. She was ashamed. But when she began to learn about her rich culture, she felt love and an enormous sense of pride. It was a revelation she needed to share. Through her cultural outreach program, started in 2012, shes arranged meetings with elders, picked medicinal plants with participants and taken them to a variety of ceremonies, including sweats  anything we can be a part of so we feel a connection to elders and these sacred lodges. So far more than 50 indigenous youth have come through Daniels program. They only show up when theyre ready, she says, and for that reason the door is always open. Two young men who walked through that door join us in the sweat lodge ceremony. They each have stories of running with gangs, trying to find a sense of belonging. Now, instead, they share excitement about going on their first vision quest, maybe next summer. The sweat ceremony consists of four rounds, marked by four songs. In the first we offer prayers for all of humanity, the second for our respective races of people, the third for our families and the fourth for ourselves. Between rounds, Courchene shares pieces of wisdom. After the second round, he announces that the spirits came to offer one of the young men  Donavan Sutherland, 16  a spiritual name. Its his first and one hes been waiting for. He is Pagamashi Kinew, or The Eagle Comes Flying Towards You. After the ceremony, Donavan gets in Daniels car and heads back to the Turtle Lodge. As the car pulls onto the property, he spots a bird in a nearby tree. Its a bald eagle. Just as Donavan steps out of the car, the eagle flies toward him and swoops past  leaving him, and those hes with, both awestruck and moved. When do you ever see eagles? the city boy says, still excited about an hour later. Theres a part of me I didnt know before. Finding that part of himself, with the help of an ancient sacred ceremony, is exactly what his ancestors would have wanted.",01/12/2016,https://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/01/us/canada-sweat-lodge/index.html
"Trump nominees say climate change is no hoax, but still invite skepticism","Trump once called climate change a ""hoax"" invented by the ChineseTrump's picks to lead the EPA, Interior and State department say climate change is real President-elect Donald Trumps pick to lead the Environmental Protection Agency told the Senate he doesnt believe climate change is a hoax. The nominees for secretary of state, energy and interior said the same thing. But what they also all added, using very similar language, is that they arent certain about the level of impact humans are having on global warming and remain skeptical about the need for urgent action on climate change. This despite the strong consensus among scientists that greenhouse gas emissions are a prime driver of global warming and associated impacts such as rising sea levels. The questions from Democrats in the hearings are based off Trump once calling climate change a hoax invented by the Chinese. His nominees all disagreed with that notion. I do not ... I do not believe climate change is a hoax, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt told the Senate Environmental and Public Works Committee Wednesday. Then, he disagreed with the scientific consensus around climate change. I believe the ability to measure with precision the degree that human activity is impacting the climate is subject to more debate on whether the climate is changing or whether human activity contributes to it, Pruitt said when pressed by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. As Trump comes into office with a call for increased production of oil, gas and coal  and prepares to attempt to roll back some of President Barack Obamas environmental regulations, the issue is of prime concern to Democrats. When Interior secretary nominee Ryan Zinke hedged during his hearing Tuesday, Sen. Al Franken, D-Minnesota, pounced I want to be honest with you, Zinke said. We both agree that the climates changing. We both agree that man is an influence. A major influence, Franken responded. Im not an expert in this field, Zinke said. To me thats a cop-out, Franken said. Im not a doctor but I have to make health care decisions. Trump, too, has also more recently acknowledged some connectivity between human activity and climate change. And just like his Cabinet picks, Trump has argued that there is an ongoing debate about how much man-made emission of greenhouse gases have contributed to the changing climate. And he has made clear that he is more concerned about the economic effects of restricting the fossil fuel industry than the environmental and human cost of climate change and its effects. It also depends on how much its going to cost companies, Trump said during a November meeting with New York Times reporters and editors after his election. Energy secretary nominee Rick Perry said Thursday that he believes the climate is changing and that some of it is naturally occurring, but some of it is also caused by man made activity  and also brought up the economic issue. The question is, how do we address it in a thoughtful way that doesnt compromise economic growth? Perry said, adding later that he is committed to making decisions based on sound science and that also take into account the economic impact. Rex Tillerson, the ExxonMobil chief nominated for secretary of state for his part, said during his confirmation hearing he believes the risk of climate change does exist, the increase in greenhouse gas in the atmosphere are having an effect and vaguely offered that action should be taken. But Tillerson gave no indication of what that action would look like or whether it would be a priority  and also questioned the science. The increase in the greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere are having an effect. Our ability to predict that effect is very limited, he said, a statement at odds with scientists assessments of most climate change effects. Tillerson, for his part, took steps in his leadership of the worlds largest oil company to acknowledge the reality of climate change and supported global action on the issue.",18/01/2017,https://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/17/politics/donald-trump-cabinet-picks-climate-change/index.html
Scientists highlight deadly health risks of climate change,"Former Vice President Al Gore hosted a controversial Climate & Health Meeting on ThursdayFuture climate change events will cause premature deaths, experts said The future is expected to hold more deadly heat waves, the fast spread of certain infectious diseases and catastrophic food shortages. These events could cause premature deaths  and theyre all related to climate change, according to a panel of experts who gathered at the Carter Center in Atlanta on Thursday for the Climate & Health Meeting. The Climate & Health Meeting was organized to replace the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions climate change conference, which was postponed in January, ahead of President Donald Trumps inauguration. The Trump administration did not explicitly ask for the move, CNN reported in January. Although Trump has said that there is some connectivity between human activity and climate change, he also has expressed doubts about the climate crisis. The meeting became a subject of controversy as Trump prepared to take office last month. However, the meeting allowed experts to sound alarms about the deadly health risks associated with climate change. Between 2030 and 2050, climate change is projected to cause about 250,000 additional deaths per year from heat stress, malnutrition and the spread of infectious diseases like malaria, according to the World Health Organization. The extreme weather events calculated by the insurance industry have obviously been increasing, former US Vice President Al Gore said in a keynote speech at the meeting. As Ive said on other occasions, every night on the television news now is like a nature hike through the Book of Revelation. The majority of climate scientists  97%  agree that climate change is real and human pollution is largely responsible. Some scientists question whether the WHO projection might be an underestimate, especially since approximating future death rates has proved to be difficult. Yet many agree that the number of climate-related deaths is expected to rise. Those WHO statistics are just from some very specific health outcomes where we have some known working equations and models to do it, said Dr. Jonathan Patz, a professor and director of the Global Health Institute at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who participated in the meeting. Some of the questions about how many deaths will climate change cause, it may be unanswerable as far as a specific number, but when you look at the multiple pathways through which climate disrupts all sorts of health outcomes, it could be enormous, he said. Those numbers from WHO, I think, were an example but a drop in the bucket as far as really what the impacts could be. Of all climate-related causes of death, heat stress is responsible for the most deaths in the United States, Gore said. He hosted the event along with the American Public Health Association and more than 50 organizations representing scientists, policymakers and activists. Mortality increases 4% on average during these heat waves, he said. Data from the US Natural Hazard Statistics show that heat caused the most weather-related fatalities, on average, between both 1986 and 2015 and 2006 and 2015. However, flooding caused the most weather-related deaths in 2015 alone. Globally, flooding on a global basis has first place, Gore said. An increase of thousands to tens of thousands of premature heat-related deaths in the summer is projected each year by the end of the century, according to a climate and health assessment released by the US Global Change Research Program. Last year was Earths hottest year on record since record-keeping began in the 1880s, according to the World Meteorological Organization. There is a clear warming trend, and that threatens health. It threatens our health. The Earth is warming because of our concentrations of greenhouse gases. The rate of warming in the last 30 years outpaces anything in the prior 1,000 years, said Kim Knowlton, senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council and assistant clinical professor at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, during a panel discussion at Thursdays meeting. Heat waves, which are extreme heat events that last several days, are the No. 1 cause of US weather-related fatalities on average over the last 30 years, more than tornadoes, more than floods, more than lightning, she said. Along with heat, the spread of infectious diseases can pose a higher risk of death, and high temperatures can play a role in the spread of such diseases. Climate change can impact human infectious disease via the pathogen itself, via the host or by creating conditions for transmission, according to a study published in the journal Environment International last year. The study involved reviewing research on climate change and health published between 1990 and 2015. For instance, warmer and wetter weather can provide ideal conditions for disease-carrying mosquitoes to flourish, promoting the spread of mosquito-borne diseases. This might have occurred recently in the spread of the Zika virus. Although a combination of factors played a role in the Zika outbreak, changes in the environment caused by climate change can influence the spread of mosquitoes carrying the virus, according to a document from the CDC (PDF). From November to January, there have been 5,000, or 4,000 or more, cases of Zika in Puerto Rico, Gore said during his keynote speech at the meeting. The CDC does an outstanding job, but there were budget constraints and political maneuvering, and no need to get into that here, except to make the point, we need better monitoring, he said. We need the kind of disease surveillance that will help the public health experts prepare for this and mobilize their resources. Gore also mentioned how many plants, especially crops, suffer from climate impacts. More extreme weather events, from high temperatures to flooding, can prevent crops from growing and reduce yields, but higher CO2 levels could also affect the foods you eat. Essential nutrients like zinc, iron, copper, magnesium and calcium could decrease significantly in the food crops that we rely upon, and this is not because of higher temperatures; this is because of higher CO2 levels, Gore said in his speech. Elevated CO2 has been associated with reduced protein and nitrogen content in alfalfa and soybean plants, resulting in a loss of quality, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. Despite the controversy surrounding the meeting, Gore and other presenters seemed pleased with the turnout. They tried to cancel this conference but it is going forward anyway, Gore said in a statement January 26. Today we face a challenging political climate, but climate shouldnt be a political issue. Health professionals urgently need the very best science in order to protect the public, and climate science has increasingly critical implications for their day-to-day work, he said in the statement. With more and more hot days, which exacerbate the proliferation of the Zika virus and other public health threats, we cannot afford to waste any time. The Carter Center is a nonprofit founded by former President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn Carter, to fight disease, hunger, poverty, conflict and oppression around the world. Carter offered use of its facilities for Thursdays Climate & Health Meeting. In a guest appearance at the meeting, Carter said that while considering the possible opinion or disapproval of Congress, the CDC has to be a little bit cautious politically; the Carter Center doesnt. Experts hope efforts to reverse climate change effects also will benefit public health  and death rate projections. Its very hard to quantify worldwide death rates from climate change. We can do it in relatively small ways, malaria, hunger, severe storms, but the really big killers are likely to be dropoffs in nutrition, infectious diseases that are a result of both spreading vectors and of poor nutrition, population dislocation and migration, said Dr. Howard Frumkin, a professor at the University of Washington School of Public Health, who participated in the meeting. What will determine the projected number of deaths, he said, will be depending on how good a job we do in dealing with climate change.",17/02/2017,https://edition.cnn.com/2017/02/16/health/climate-change-deaths-health-al-gore-bn/index.html
Is there a link between climate change and diabetes?,"A study links diabetes and climate change, but researchers say the findings do not imply causationHeat waves, infectious diseases and food shortages are among climate change-related public health concerns Scientists have long warned that rising global temperatures may impact public health in a devastating way because climate change is associated with deadly weather events, the spread of infectious diseases and even food shortages. Now, researchers are looking at whether climate change might be linked to another public health concern: Type 2 diabetes. Between 1996 and 2009, as outdoor temperatures rose across the United States, so did the prevalence of diabetes, according to a study published in the journal BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care on Monday. We were surprised though by the magnitude of the effect size, said Lisanne Blauw, a researcher at Leiden University Medical Center in The Netherlands and lead author of the study. We calculated that a 1-degree Celsius rise in environmental temperature could account for more than 100,000 new diabetes cases per year in the USA alone, she said. Future research into the effects of global warming on our health status is therefore of great importance. However, this observational study simply reveals an association between climate and diabetes, not a causation. Among the factors known to cause Type 2 diabetes are being overweight or obese and having a family history of the disease. I think calorie consumption and weight are probably the biggest by a country mile, said Dr. Adrian Vella, an endocrinologist who has researched Type 2 diabetes at the Mayo Clinic. He was not involved in the new study. I think the general message always should be that association studies do not actually imply causation, he said of linking climate change and diabetes. Currently, about one out of every three Americans will develop Type 2 diabetes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For the new study, researchers analyzed data on the incidence of Type 2 diabetes in the United States, including the territories of Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, between 1996 and 2009. The data came from the CDCs Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. The researchers also analyzed data on the mean annual temperature per state using data from the National Centers for Environmental Information. Global data were analyzed, too. Information on fasting blood glucose levels and obesity was gathered through the World Health Organizations Global Health Observatory online database. The researchers found that for every 1-degree Celsius increase in outdoor temperature, there was about a 4% increase of the total diabetes incidence in the United States per year between 1996 and 2009, Blauw said. An increase of 1 degree Celsius is equivalent to an increase of 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit on the Fahrenheit temperature scale. The worldwide prevalence of glucose intolerance rose by 0.17% per 1-degree Celsius increase in temperature, the researchers found. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to assess the association of outdoor temperature with diabetes incidence and the prevalence of raised fasting blood glucose on a national and global level, the researchers wrote. Although more research is needed to determine why  and how  this correlation even exists, the study posed one hypothesis that involves the way cooler temperatures can activate a type of body fat called brown fat, or brown adipose tissue. The function of brown fat tissue is to burn fat to generate heat, which is important to prevent a decline in body temperature during cold exposure. Therefore, we hypothesize that brown fat plays a role in the mechanism underlying the association between outdoor temperature and diabetes, Blauw said. In warmer climates, brown fat may be less activated, which may causally lead to insulin resistance and diabetes. On the other hand, Vella said that brown fat doesnt have that much of an impact on metabolism in humans. In humans, brown adipose tissue likely explains about 1% or 2% of energy expenditure in cold situations, and shivering explains far more, so its an exaggeration, he said. Between 1996 and 2009, I believe the environment has changed, he added. Lots of things changed that might change diabetes incidence, right? The actual population composition changed a little bit. The caloric consumption of that population likely changed. We dont know about physical activity. In 2012, an International Diabetes Federation report indicated that Type 2 diabetes and climate change may be interconnected public health concerns. Climate change threatens the fresh food supply, which may negatively impact the diets of those with diabetes, according to the report (PDF). Also, deadly heat waves may weaken overall health due to dehydration. In hotter temperatures, dehydration and heatstroke increases morbidity and mortality in people with diabetes. People with diabetes are predisposed to cardiovascular events during heat waves and higher mortality from heart attack on days of high air pollution, according to the report. Meanwhile, an increased prevalence of diabetes may lead to more carbon emissions being generated by the health care systems treating those patients. Diabetes-related complications  such as (cardiovascular disease), stroke and renal failure  cost lives and money. Hospitalizations from such complications are also energy-intensive and increase (greenhouse gas) emissions, according to the report. Last week, the Medical Society Consortium on Climate & Health released a medical alert report titled Climate Change Is Harming Our Health (PDF). The report outlined how, across the country, climate change may lead to deadly heat waves; worsened outdoor air quality; hazardous extreme weather events; food-related infections; water-related infections; mosquito- and tick-borne infections; wildfires; and higher levels of depression, anxiety and PTSD among flood victims and farmers. In the executive summary, the authors wrote, We  physicians in medical societies representing over half of the nations doctors  see a need to share our growing understanding and concern about the health consequences of climate change with all Americans.",20/03/2017,https://edition.cnn.com/2017/03/20/health/climate-change-type-2-diabetes-study/index.html
Where climate change is threatening the health of Americans,"A report maps where in the US certain climate change-related health risks are prevalent""Americans consider climate change as an 'over there' problem,"" one expert says As President Donald Trump looks to curb the governments enforcement of climate regulations, experts are concerned about how the action might impact public health. The current federal political climate in the United States bodes ill for the future of the worlds climate and by extension for the health of people around the world, Americans included, said Dr. Mona Sarfaty, director of the program on climate and health at George Mason Universitys Center for Climate Change Communication. Sarfaty helped prepare a report, released last month by the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health, that mapped how climate change threatens the health of people across the United States and how those threats vary by region. Extreme temperatures and weather events, poor outdoor air quality, contaminated food and water, mosquito- and tick-borne infections, wildfires and stresses on mental health are the climate-related health risks identified in the report by practicing physicians. Theres a gap between the publics understanding of the health implications of climate change and physicians understanding of the health implications of climate change, Sarfaty said. Most people are not aware that climate change is a danger to their health, and physicians see that risk. Globally, about 12.6 million people die each year due to environmental risk factors such as pollution, extreme weather or climate-related disease, according to the World Health Organization. Between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause 250,000 additional deaths per year around the world, according to the WHO  including in the United States. I think Americans consider climate change as an over there problem or confined to poor countries, said Dr. Jonathan Patz, a professor and director of the Global Health Institute at the University of Wisconson-Madison, who was not involved in the consortiums report. Climate change is already influencing the frequency of heatwaves, flooding events and famines, as well as epidemics of vector- and waterborne diseases, he said. But in a globalized world, an increase in disease anywhere in the world can affect us all. People along the East Coast might be at a greater risk of mosquito- and tick-borne infections as the climate becomes hotter and more humid, creating an ideal breeding environment for those disease-carrying insects, according to the report. Mosquitoes can transmit dengue fever, Zika and West Nile virus, which has spread across the country and is popping up in outbreaks periodically, recently in Texas and Louisiana, Sarfaty said. Although a number of factors played a role in the recent Zika virus outbreak, climate-related changes in the environment might have influenced the spread of mosquitoes carrying the virus, according to a document from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (PDF). Extreme weather along the East Coast, especially in the summer, also has resulted in the spread of bacterial infections, Sarfaty said. When increased rainfall leads to flooding, there can be a mixing of stormwater and sewage that leads to bacterial contamination in the water. This has been a problem in recreational lakes in the Midwest, Sarfaty said. Bacterial contamination also can impact crops, leading to an increase in food-related infections. Warmer ocean water also makes a difference. Along the coast, there are cases of bacterial contamination in shellfish in the warmer months that have those waters more likely to cause infection when people swim there, especially if they have open cuts in their skin, she said. There have been some cases off the coast of Florida where people have gotten skin infections. Sarfaty added that areas along the Mississippi and Ohio rivers, such as in Missouri and Ohio, have experienced increased flooding in recent years, which also has led to a risk of contaminated water and water-related infections. There was an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in Wisconsin some years ago that was related to one of these rain events, she said. Both the East and West coasts of the United States are threatened by extreme summer heat, flooding, storms, drought, poor air quality that can impact breathing, allergies and the mental health problems that come with dealing with those health threats, according to the consortiums report. When people are displaced from their homes because of floods or extreme storms ... this loss of home and separation from family and community leads to mental health impacts that can be reflected in substance abuse, alcoholism, domestic strife or violence, depression or anxiety, Sarfaty said. Meanwhile, the Great Plains and Midwest face a slightly different mix of climate change-related health impacts. Poor air quality, extreme weather and wildfires threaten the Great Plains, while food- and water-related infections and mosquito- and tick-borne diseases threaten the Midwest, according to the consortiums report. Youve got Lyme disease spreading west into the Midwestern states, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, certainly spreading further north into Canada and also south into Virginia. ... The tick that carries Lyme disease is now found in many more counties than it was before, Sarfaty said. Changes in climate also have affected some crops and food sources in the Great Plains and Midwest, according to the consortiums report. One of the more recent findings that has been surprising to me is the increasing evidence that a carbon dioxide-enriched atmosphere is actually leading to crops that have lower nutritional value, Sarfaty said. So its impacting the nutritional value of grains. Thats something which has been increasingly documented, and of course its very worrisome because the population depends on the growth of grains as a staple in our diet, she said. Most climate scientists agree that humans are causing the planet to warm by polluting the atmosphere with heat-trapping greenhouse gases. Carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas emitted through human activities, such as burning fossil fuels like coal, natural gas and oil at power plants. Fossil fuel pollutants can generate particulate matter, a complex mixture of tiny particles and liquid droplets in the atmosphere. Once inhaled, these small particles can impact your heart and lungs, with serious health effects. The most widespread health problems that physicians reported to us are lung and heart conditions related to poor air quality, Sarfaty said of the consortiums report. Between 60,000 to 80,000 Americans still die early from exposure to particulate air pollution, stemming mostly from burning fossil fuels, said Patz, the professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. This consortium also defines the reduction of fossil fuel combustion as one of the best interventions we can do to immediately improve our health, be it through clearer air quality to promoting physically active commuting in cities, he said. Trump signed an executive order last month to review and possibly eliminate the Environmental Protection Agencys Clean Power Plan, which was intended to regulate and cut greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. The Industrial Revolution played a major role in expanding the use of burning coal, and humans have increased the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by more than a third since the Industrial Revolution, about 150 years ago, according to NASA. This atmospheric impact on the climate has worsened allergy symptoms, Sarfaty said. Ragweed plants are very widespread on the East Coast and into the Midwest and a very common cause of allergies. Those plants actually have more potent allergen in them when they grow in higher-carbon-dioxide atmospheres, Sarfaty said. One of the things that were beginning to hear is that, Oh, we dont have to worry about carbon dioxide, because carbon dioxide is plant food. Well, it turns out that carbon dioxide is actually causing more virulent allergens, she said. Sarfaty also said allergies and some other climate-related health effects tend to be more widespread than regional. Extreme heat and wildfires are two that have swept most of the country. From 1999 to 2010, there were more than 7,000 heat-related deaths in the US, an average of about 618 per year, according to the CDC. As for wildfires, the threat appears more along the West Coast, but there have been recent flareups in other parts of the country, according to the consortiums report. Last year, a wildfire raged through eastern Tennessee, leaving 14 people dead and 175 injured, and destroying more than 2,400 homes, businesses, and other properties. Large wildfires now burn more than twice the area they did around 1970, according to the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. Just a 1-degree Celsius rise in the planets average global temperature is expected to produce up to a 400% increase in areas burned by wildfires, according to a 2011 report from the National Research Councils Committee on Stabilization Targets for Atmospheric Greenhouse Gas Concentrations. Smoke plumes from wildfires can impact the health of residents 100 miles away, Sarfaty said. They can cause increases to emergency rooms for all kinds of respiratory conditions and for cardiac conditions as well, including heart attacks and episodes of heart failure, she said. Air quality worsens with rising heat and/or wildfires; longer, more severe allergy conditions; and injuries related to extreme weather events, she said. These most common conditions seen by physicians and associated with climate change are becoming so widespread that its hard to cast them as strictly regional vulnerabilities. Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said that as the climate continues to change, the health of more Americans could be affected. The wildfire risk on the West, the infectious disease risks in the Midwest and the East Coast are striking differences, Benjamin said. More people will find themselves directly impacted as environmental conditions get worse. We have the opportunity to address this now, he said. At some point the climate changes become more difficult to reverse and many of the events like floods, severe storms and toxic air become so severe that communities will become uninhabitable. A threat to inhabitability looms over other parts of the world. As a result of climate change, scientists predict that areas in the Middle East and North Africa could become uninhabitable in the summers by 2100. This may exacerbate humanitarian hardship and contribute to migration, according to a study published last year in the journal Climate Change. Yet as mainstream medical societies are recognizing how much climate change threatens our health, communities can prepare for these health impacts, Patz said, giving a nod to the consortiums report. To be honest, I am not surprised by any content in the report and am extremely encouraged by mainstream medical societies now recognizing how much climate change threatens our health, he said. What stood out to me is how these medical societies are already prioritizing prevention or mitigation of climate change as a major component to the response from the health-care sector.",13/04/2017,https://edition.cnn.com/2017/04/13/health/climate-change-health-risks-us-map-explainer/index.html
"As the seas around them rise, fishermen deny climate change","People live and die by the water in southern Louisiana. The Gulf of Mexico, the rivers, lakes, and massive marshes that look more like sea than land, are woven into their identity. Theyre always there. The water brings food, livelihoods and culture. But it also takes. Rising seas have swallowed more than 1,800 miles of coastline in the last 78 years, according to the United States Geological Survey. That puts residents here at the forefront of areas affected by climate changes. But among four people who spend most of the day outside, whose lives are dependent on the weather, who stare at the same horizon each day, there is little agreement on what climate change will bring, or even if it exists. Leo Dotson is among the skeptics. Hes been shrimping in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, for 54 years and hell admit the coastline has changed. Its moved, he says. But that has nothing to do with man-made climate change, he adds. Dotson gets red in the face, repeating that scientific studies showing climate change as affecting weather patterns or warming the Earth are simply wrong. The 67-year-old owner of Dyson Seafood is out on the water every single day. Hes seen nothing out there to indicate climate change is having a disastrous impact on the region. Seven days a week, the powerful weather in the region permitting, Dotsons boats go up and down the Gulf of Mexico coast, dragging large trawls along the seafloor to scoop up shellfish. I work outside in the weather on a boat, and its all pretty much been the same for me, Dotson says, standing on Jetty Pier in Cameron, gesturing toward the ocean. The climate is exactly the same as when I was a kid. Summers hot, winters cold. Any changes to the coast are simply the world changing back and forth, he says. Greenery has given way to water and with a rising sea level and sinking land, whats left is more prone to flooding. Cameron Parish and the surrounding Chenier Plain are considered an extremely vulnerable coastline by Tulane University researchers. Scientists say climate change, with warming temperatures and rising seas, are what intensifies that vulnerability. They can point to a 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) increase in average temperatures since the Industrial Revolution, when humans started burning fossil fuels. They can point to last year being the hottest on record, to 16 of the top 17 hottest years occurring since 2000 to show the climate is changing. But in this parish where fisherman and shrimpers thrive, some people feel differently. Cameron is home to the highest percentage of people in a county who believe climate change doesnt affect plants or animals, according to a recent Yale University study. Of the 4,500-plus who live here, more than 36% share those views. The county also places in the top 10 when it comes to those who dismiss climate change overall. Dotson doesnt believe climate change would negatively impact the fishing industry on the Louisiana coast. Not based on what hes seen. It doesnt concern me. What is science? Science is an educated guess, Dotson says defiantly. What if they guess wrong? Theres just as much chance as them to be wrong as there is for them to be right. Could anything change Dotsons mind on climate change? Only a very specific scientist. If he was 500 years old, and he told me its changed, I would probably believe him, Dotson says. But in my lifetime, I didnt see any change. Jeff Poe is reeling in speckled trout on his fishing boat with his 29-year-old son, Nick, who is helping run the family business, Big Lake Guide Services. Poe has led fishing tours on Calcasieu Lake and the marshes surrounding the Gulf of Mexico since 1984. The brackish mix of fresh and salt water in Calcasieu Lake, like much of the Southeast Louisiana coast, has created historically a rare paradise for oysters to thrive. But the oyster population has been declining since 2009, despite the states various attempts at restoration. Poe, who lives and dies with the weather and who has seen the lake level rise where he takes his boat out each day, does not buy the argument that were witnessing irreversible changes. Yes, the oysters have been dying, but that may not be caused by the changes in the sea level or how much saltwater is in the lake. Yes, climate change is happening, but it can change and go the other way, too. And if hes wrong, well what could humans do about it? He doubts whether limiting carbon dioxide emissions would actually lower the temperature enough to make a difference. And why should they try, based on a prediction alone? You know I like my AC, I like running around in a boat like this, my livelihood depends on having gasoline to use at a reasonable price, he says. All things told, Poe is not alarmed. Tulane Earth scientist Krista Jankowski could not disagree more. She refers to this area as ground zero when it comes to sea-level impact. Jankowski recently published a study on the imminent threat facing the states wetlands, which showed sea-level rise occurs here four times faster than the national average. Even if she cant sway minds, Jankowski still hopes to get action. The reluctance of some people in coastal Louisiana to accept that there are big challenges ahead is, in my opinion, a reflection of a societal focus on the present and very short-term as opposed to thinking about even 20 to 50 years out, Jankowski says. Even if we cant agree on the source, can we at least agree that something has to be done based on the changes that we do see? And the problems that are coming up? The problems arent just coming. Down the coast, theyve already begun. Two-hundred miles east of Cameron, in the Mississippi Delta, pilot Charlie Hammonds has been flying since the 1950s, when he was 15. Today as he glides over the wetlands around Houma, he sees dead trees submerged in saltwater. His cockpit has given him a vantage point over the last 50 or 60 years to see a cancer spread across the land. Scientists and locals all agree the fragile wetlands are an extremely complicated ecosystem. And they will admit there are many possible reasons for changes, in addition to the sea levels rising. Tulanes Jankowski concedes the land itself is sinking because of the settling of materials brought by the Mississippi River over the last several thousand years. But she says the massive amount of data obtained for the unprecedented Tulane study has left absolutely no doubt in her mind that sea-level rise is also playing a big part. Fishing, shrimping, crabbing and oystering villages like Cocodrie, Chauvin, and Dulac now have to prepare for the worst. It is a scenario that Native American families on Isle de Jean Charles have already experienced. Eight generations of Biloxi Chitimacha-Choctaws have called the area home since the 1830s. Their land shrank from 2,200 acres to around 350 acres. About 70% of the population has left. Chris Brunet is one of about 70 people who chose to stay, for now. Hes watched the island die before his eyes. Large trees in full bloom used to fill his yard. They slowly withered and rotted away, and are now gone. It didnt happen overnight, Brunet says. It was like a slow process, but then. Wow. The paradise where his grandparents caught wild fish 100 years ago is gone. He believes natural factors, human factors, and oil and gas industries nearby destroyed it. I believe that the Gulf of Mexico is such a powerful force that it wants to make its way north. And that man did play a part in bringing it to a more rapid process to what it is today, Brunet says. Brunet, 51, says the focus now must shift toward moving so future generations can survive. How to prepare is also on the mind of Jonathan Foret back in Houma, where he shows children around his South Louisiana Wetlands Discovery Center. As they discuss the possibility their homes, like those on Isle de Jean Charles, may also melt away into nothing but memories in a scrapbook, he thinks of a Bible story as a symbol. Just like Noah, weve been given some information about what is going to happen in the future, and we can prepare for that future, or we can decide to dismiss the facts, Foret says. What we decide to do will directly impact the future of our families and our communities. Me, Im going to build a boat. Facts dont change based on my ability to stomach them.",21/04/2017,https://edition.cnn.com/2017/04/20/us/louisiana-climate-change-skeptics/index.html
EPA removes climate change information from website,"EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has expressed doubt about the reasons for climate changeThe EPA's associate administrator for public affairs said the agency wants ""to eliminate confusion by removing outdated language"" The EPA removed most climate change information from its website Friday, saying in a press release that language on the website is being updated to reflect the approach of new leadership. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has expressed doubt about the reasons for climate change, saying in a CNBC interview in March that he was skeptical of the role carbon dioxide plays. I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do, and theres tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact, Pruitt said. So, no, I would not agree that its a primary contributor to the global warming that we see. J.P. Freire, the EPAs associate administrator for public affairs, said the agency wants to eliminate confusion by removing outdated language first and making room to discuss how were protecting the environment and human health by partnering with states and working within the law. Visitors to the website now find most climate change information is being updated, although the page that addresses climate change in the water sector still reflects a basic assessment that global warming is affecting water and precipitation. These impacts are likely to affect the programs designed to protect water quality, public health, and safety, the web page says. Environmental groups were dismayed by the EPAs removal of climate change information from its website. Speaking at the DC protest on climate change issues Saturday, a Sierra club spokesperson told CNN the move is a sad reflection on the priorities of Donald Trump and EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. If they havent gotten the message yet, theyre about to get it today. The American people want a government to fight for the health of this planet and for climate action to help protect all families in America.",29/04/2017,https://edition.cnn.com/2017/04/29/politics/epa-climate-change-website/index.html
"Climate confusion is back, and it? dangerous","Until Friday night, the eve of the Peoples Climate March on Washington, the US government website EPA.gov/climatechange explained how humans are warming the planet by burning fossil fuels and why that is a huge deal for us and for future generations. Now the page carries an Orwellian message: This page is being updated. Thank you for your interest in this topic, the message continues. We are currently updating our website to reflect EPAs priorities under the leadership of President [Donald] Trump and [US Environmental Protection Agency] Administrator [Scott] Pruitt. Its been clear for months, if not years, what Donald Trump and his appointees think of climate change. At worst, they call it a hoax. At best, they say its overblown  no big deal. We need more science, they claim, while also moving to strip government science agencies of funding. They want us to keep debating the climate crisis while they make it worse. That is troubling, not only because Trumps retrograde fossil-fuel policies are likely to contribute to all the bad things that come along with human-induced global warming, from worsening droughts to faster-rising seas and mass extinction. It is troubling because Trump and his administration are gaslighting the American public on the science of climate change. Following a playbook that seems to be written by the tobacco industry, the Trump administration and other prominent skeptics inject uncertainty and confusion into climate policy where it doesnt belong. And the strategy appears to be working. Climate confusion is back into the American zeitgeist. In addition to the website changes, which the administration has acknowledged and will be fully apparent only after the EPA posts replacements for the former climate change websites, a US House committee held a March 29 hearing giving voice to climate skeptics who say its unclear to what degree humans are causing global warming. While it is true that no science is absolutely certain (its science, so its always asking new questions of itself and evolving), the overwhelming majority of climate scientists  at least 97%, according to peer-reviewed studies  say humans are causing warming by polluting the atmosphere with heat-trapping gases, primarily by burning fuels like coal, oil and natural gas. Burning those fuels releases carbon dioxide and other gases. Their heat-trapping properties have been understood since the 1800s. Former NASA scientist James Hansen testified to Congress about the perils of the global warming in 1988, nearly 30 years ago. And the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change declared in 2014, after extensive review of the best science, that the buildup of these gases in the atmosphere, caused by humans, is extremely likely to have been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century. In other words: Nearly certain. Worth betting on. Extremely likely. Yet, Trump and others who hold the megaphone these days fixate on the thinnest slivers of doubt. On Friday, the same day as the EPA website changes (which also included the removal of some other climate change-related websites for revision, including one on the Clean Power Plan), The New York Times ran a debut op-ed by columnist Bret Stephens. In the piece, Stephens seemed to rationalize skepticism about climate change and its potentially dire outcomes. Claiming total certainty about the science traduces the spirit of science and creates openings for doubt whenever a climate claim proves wrong ... None of this is to deny climate change or the possible severity of its consequences, Stephens wrote. But ordinary citizens also have a right to be skeptical of an overweening scientism. The implication seems to be: Take climate change with a grain of salt; assume its real but ... maybe not? Or maybe its consequences are overblown. Its reasonable to acknowledge there are probabilities and uncertainties inherent in scientific predictions. Its dangerous, however, to overstate uncertainty and use it to justify inaction. All the best science tells us that more greenhouse gases are dangerous for the planet, posing an expensive and potentially existential threat to life as we know it. Some climate scientists have responded by canceling their subscriptions to The Times. The Times has denounced the critics of its decision [to hire Stephens] as left-leaning, Stefan Rahmstorf, a professor of physics of the oceans at Germanys Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, wrote in a letter to The Times. This is an insult to me and was the final straw to cancel my subscription. There is no left-leaning or right-leaning climate science, just as there is no Republican or Democrat theory of gravity. I have several good climate scientist friends who have been lifelong Republicans. Their understanding of climate change does not differ from mine, because it is informed by the evidence. CO2 traps heat  more CO2 means a warmer climate, he continued. That is basic physics, borne out by the history of climate. Denying these well-established facts is about as smart as claiming the Earth is flat, and best left to cranks, ideologues and fossil fuel lobbyists. Dana Nuccitelli, an environmental scientist, wrote in The Guardian that people should think about these probabilities like they think about smoking. Each time we smoke, Nuccitelli wrote, we increase the odds of developing cancer a little bit more. The future outcome is uncertain  we dont know exactly if or when the disaster of cancer will hit  but we know were making it more likely every time we smoke, and the smart move is to mitigate that risk by cutting down on the cigarettes as quickly as possible. With climate change, each time we add more carbon pollution to the atmosphere, we increase the odds of a climate catastrophe a little bit more. The smart move is to mitigate that risk by cutting down on our burning of fossil fuels as quickly as possible. Stephens piece is akin to criticizing doctors and anti-smoking groups for being too mean to the tobacco industry, and for not focusing on the uncertainty about exactly when the chain-smoking patient will develop cancer. Trump and the rest seem to want us to keep smoking the planet  despite well-proven risks. Yet, government spin doesnt change reality. It doesnt have to change our perception of it, either.",02/05/2017,https://edition.cnn.com/2017/05/01/politics/sutter-epa-nyt-doubt-climate-change/index.html
Climate change expected to make turbulence stronger and more frequent,"With climate change, you can expect a bumpy ride, scientist says""Severe turbulence"" expected to increase by 149% Climate change is expected to affect your life in some surprising ways in the coming decades. From worsening pollen allergies to lowered sex drives, raising the planets temperature by continued greenhouse gas emissions has wide ranging impacts  but did you know that global warming may also make your plane ride significantly bumpier? There is a growing amount of research that shows that as the planet warms from climate change, the second half of this century will see an increase in turbulence, especially along the heavily-traveled transatlantic routes in the Northern Hemisphere (like routes between Europe and North America). Climate change is strengthening the north-south temperature difference that drives the jet stream, according to Dr. Paul Williams of the University of Reading in the UK. A stronger jet stream is less stable and means more clear-air turbulence, Williams told CNN. Clear-air turbulence is the most common cause of your in-flight roller coaster, and can result in significant injuries, such as earlier this week on a Aeroflot flight from Moscow to Bangkok, Thailand. Williams and his colleagues most recent research, published last month in the journal Advances in Atmospheric Sciences showed that turbulence of all severities increases in model simulations of a warming climate  but the largest increase is seen in severe turbulence  the kind that hit the Aeroflot flight. Increases in light and moderate turbulence will not injure anyone, but they will cause anxiety amongst nervous fliers. Williams said. On the other hand, the 149% increase in severe turbulence that we have calculated does have the potential to cause more serious injuries. Clear-air turbulence (CAT) is caused by rapid changes in speed or direction of air movement. This occurs most commonly in and around an invisible current of rapidly moving air called the jet stream, which can be found at a height similar to where commercial planes fly, around 30,000-40,000 feet above the ground. The jet stream generally follows the boundary between hot and cold air, and is strongest when the difference between the hot and cool sides is the strongest, which occurs during the winter months. The idea behind the climate change and turbulence link is fairly straightforward. If climate change influences the intensity and position of the jet stream, the turbulence resulting from that jet stream would be impacted. Human-produced emissions contribute heavily to climate change. There may be a bit of high-level irony here: The aviation industry is a significant emitter of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Williams said theres evidence the rate of turbulence injuries has risen significantly since the 1980s, even after correcting the statistics to account for the growth in aviation, but he stopped short of saying that it is caused by the warming we have already seen. We need to interpret this evidence more carefully, Williams said. According to current projections, future changes in the jet stream will cause significant disruption to aviation. The consensus of the climate models is that global climate change will cause the [average] position of the jet stream to shift closer to the poles in both hemispheres, according to Dr. Jason Furtado, an assistant professor of meteorology at the University of Oklahoma. Furtado, who researches how climate change will influence the upper levels of the atmosphere, said, The strength of the jet stream is also anticipated to increase, as the temperature change with latitude in the upper troposphere [which is where planes fly] increases in the future. This would be a double whammy to aviation. An increase in the speed of the jet stream would increase the turbulence in and around it, meaning more incidences of aircraft hitting these pockets of severe clear-air turbulence. Potentially more concerning would be the movement of the jet stream closer to the poles. In the Northern Hemisphere, this would mean a shift to the north, putting the jet stream right in the path of the North Atlantic Tracks, a sort of highway in the sky that marks the frequently traveled routes across the Atlantic between Europe and North America. Not only would climate change make the turbulence more frequent and intense, it would cause it to potentially impact thousands of more flights a day, based on current routing. And theres this: Increased turbulence would likely mean airliners will try to avoid certain areas, resulting in added fuel and other costs. A stronger jet stream might make trips from Europe to North America longer and more expensive (more fuel needed). On the flip side, the reverse route would be faster and cheaper. While Williams studies have focused on the transatlantic routes in the Northern Hemisphere, he feels the impacts will be felt globally. I would expect the same conclusions we have reached about the North Atlantic to apply to other mid-latitude flight routes around the world (in both northern and southern hemispheres). We are currently crunching the numbers for these routes, Williams told CNN. But dont cancel your post-2050 flight travels just yet, according to Furtado, there are some questions as to the robustness of the poleward/strengthening jet stream findings in some of the latest climate model runs. Furtado told CNN the conclusion of a poleward and strengthening jet stream might vary regionally and seasonally, and is something climate scientists need to study and understand further.",03/05/2017,https://edition.cnn.com/2017/05/03/world/climate-change-and-turbulence/index.html
"What does Trump believe about climate change? His aides won? say, and you can? ask him","Trump announced his Paris accord decision ThursdayHis staff can't seem to answer whether he believes climate change is real President Donald Trumps top aides apparently have no idea whether he believes humans have a role in climate change or if its even real. And seemingly wont ask him. Days after the question was first posed, the White House still will not answer if Trump believes that climate change is a hoax. Trumps personal views on climate change have been in the spotlight since the President opted to leave the sweeping, multi-national Paris climate agreement during a Rose Garden ceremony on Thursday. But a series of top Trump aides have dodged, spun and obfuscated when asked whether the President believes climate change is happening. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said earlier this week he didnt know whether Trump believes climate change is happening. Honestly, I havent asked him that, Spicer said. I can get back to you. On Friday, Spicer was asked again. I have not had the opportunity to specifically talk to the President about that, he said. Scott Pruitt, Trumps administrator at the Environmental Protection Agency, said Thursday on CNN that the debate over the Paris agreement is not about whether climate change is occurring or not. He did not answer whether Trump, as he has said before, believes climate change is a hoax. Pruitt again would not answer when asked twice in Fridays White House briefing, saying that was not what the decision was focused on. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke told CNNs New Day on Friday that while he doesnt believe (climate change) is a hoax, he was unable to answer whether Trump agrees. I do not speak for the President, Zinke said, later adding that he had not asked him. At no point was Zinke able to shed light on Trumps climate change views. You should ask him that and I hope you have a chance, Kellyanne Conway, a top Trump confidante and White House adviser, said Friday on ABC. When pressed, Conway said Trump believes in clean air, clean water, a clean environment and believes we have to negotiate better deals for this country. And Gary Cohn, Trumps top economic adviser, deflected when asked the same question by CNN on Thursday. I am answering what the President is committed to, he said, later adding, You are going to have to ask him. You are going to have to actually ask him. Journalists would love to. But Trump has largely avoided answering questions in recent weeks. The last formal questions the President took were when he met with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos on May 18. His last  and only  full news conference as president was in February. Trump, long before he was president, said that climate change was a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. He has also long cast himself as someone who doesnt believe in global warming, suggesting that the scientific fact is a belief, not a fact. Im not a believer in man-made global warming, he told Hugh Hewitt in 2015. But the problem we have, and if you look at our energy costs, and all of the things that were doing to solve a problem that I dont think in any major fashion exists. But his own White House aides have suggested that his view on climate change are irrelevant when talking about the Paris climate agreement, an accord meant to combat rising temperatures and carbon emissions. Can we stay on topic please, a White House official said during a background briefing after Trumps announcement. I have not talked to the President about his personal views on whether  I was not with the President on his trip, the official added. I did not talk to the President about his personal views on what is contributing to climate change.",02/06/2017,https://edition.cnn.com/2017/06/02/politics/donald-trump-climate-change-belief/index.html
A massive climate change study is canceled ?because of climate change,"Arctic sea ice has traveled farther south than normal along Newfoundland's northeast coastAn icebreaker has been repeatedly diverted to take part in rescue operations A $17 million study of climate change in the Canadian Arctic has been nixed for now  because of climate change. A team of scientists from the University of Manitoba and four other schools were in the middle of the first leg of a four-year study of how climate change is affecting the areas around the Hudson Bay, the university said in statement. The study, named BaySys, started last month, and the scientists were traveling on the Canadian Research Icebreaker CCGS Amundsen. But because of warmer temperatures in the Arctic, hazardous sea ice is traveling farther south than usual. The Amundsen, which is part of the Canadian Coast Guard fleet, has been diverted several times because its ice-breaking capabilities have been needed to help out in rescue efforts along Newfoundlands northeast coast. All of the delays and concerns about safety forced the cancellation of the studys first leg. Considering the severe ice conditions and the increasing demand for search and rescue operations and ice escort, we decided to cancel the BaySys mission, said Dr. David Barber, expedition chief scientist and BaySys scientific lead. A second week of delay meant our research objectives just could not be safely achieved. The challenge for us all was that the marine ice hazards were exceedingly difficult for the maritime industry, the (Canadian Coast Guard) and science. Barber and his team confirmed that a large portion of the sea ice they were seeing off Newfoundlands coast was indeed from the Arctic. Climate-related changes in Arctic sea ice not only reduce its extent and thickness but also increase its mobility meaning that ice conditions are likely to become more variable and severe conditions such as these will occur more often, Barber said. The ironic events wont scrap the entire project though. The studys second leg, due to take off early next month, is still on, said fellow researcher Dr. Louis Fortier, the scientific director of the Amundsen and ArcticNets science programs.",16/06/2017,https://edition.cnn.com/2017/06/16/world/climate-change-study-canceled-trnd/index.html
Climate change could lower the quality of your coffee,"Rising temperatures cause coffee beans to ripen too quickly and lose complex flavorsBy 2050, the global demand for coffee will double. But there will be half as much suitable land to grow it on What will it take for people to care about climate change? For some, the thought of a crummier cup of coffee in the morning just might do it. A new study finds that Ethiopia, the worlds fifth-largest coffee producer, could lose up to 60% of its suitable farming land by the end of this century because of climate change. The study, published Monday in Nature Plants, found the combination of low rainfall and rising temperatures could have substantial effects on the coffee-growing areas in the country. As temperatures steadily climb, so does the demand from coffee junkies, who might not be able to find a cup of joe thats up to their standards. According to a report from World Coffee Research, the demand for coffee will have doubled by 2050, but the suitable land to grow it on will be cut in half. And the effects of climate change dont just lower how much coffee is produced  they can also hamper its quality. In areas with lower temperatures, coffee quality is generally higher, World Coffee Research spokeswoman Hanna Neuschwander told CNN. Cooler temperatures allow the coffee to ripen more slowly  and that means more time to develop more complex flavor elements like acidity and sweetness. But when temperatures rise, as they have slowly been doing in Ethiopia for years, the warmth causes the coffee to ripen too quickly, which means less flavorful beans. A shift in quality is the main difference consumers will see. Even though a decline in suitable farming land would logically lead to a decline in supply, Neuschwander said its not likely that coffee drinkers will see any hike in price. Even if production drops in one country, such as Ethiopia, prices could drop at the same time in other major coffee-exporting countries, like Brazil or Vietnam, Neuschwander said. It takes a lot longer for consumer effects to travel, Neuschwander said. Its a very distorted market as a commodity market. Coffee junkies may not see any big changes in price, but the impact on Ethiopias economy could be huge. Arabica coffee production makes up about one quarter of the countrys total export earnings. Fifteen million people, or 16% of the population, make a living through coffee farming. Most of those coffee farmers are smallholders, according to World Coffee Research. Smallholders manage modest, usually family-owned farms, which means they might not have the resources available to adapt to these climate changes. With less ability to adjust, they are more likely to stop growing coffee altogether. The problem is coffee producers arent paid enough, so helping them adapt to a very difficult complex, changing situation like you see with climate change and extreme weather events is very, very difficult to do, Neuschwander said. Ethiopian coffee farmers have noticed climate changes that have harmed production, including warmer nights, a shorter wet season, irregular precipitation patterns and more extreme weather. And theres science to back up the farmers observations: Research cited in the Nature Plants study shows an uptick in warmer days in various areas where coffee is grown. On top of the observable effects, Ethiopias average annual temperature increased by 1.3 degrees from 1960 to 2006. Thats a rate of .28 degrees per decade, and that average could push up temperatures another 3.1 degrees by the 2060s. Ethiopia has also seen big changes in precipitation. Since the mid-1970s, rainfall has decreased by 15% to 20% in the southern part of the nation, and droughts have become more common in all parts of the country for the last 10 to 15 years. None of this is great news for lovers of Ethiopian coffee, who may eventually want to look to other countries for their coffee fix.",21/06/2017,https://edition.cnn.com/2017/06/21/world/coffee-climate-change-trnd/index.html
Scientists fear WH will bury federal climate change report,"Scientists worry that the White House will intervene before it's publishedDraft assessment concludes that Americans are already feeling the effects of climate change A not-yet-released federal report on climate change finds that humans are already witnessing the effects of a warming globe  and the reports authors are fearing that the White House will intervene before its published. The average temperature in the United States has risen rapidly and drastically since 1980, with the most recent years being the warmest of the past 1,500 years, according to a previous draft of the special science section of the National Climate Assessment published by The New York Times Monday. The draft posted by the Times was the third draft and was previously posted for public review between December 2016 and February 2017. CNN is told the version of the draft that is awaiting Trump administration approval has since been revised twice, although the main findings of the report are still in line with the findings in this older version of the draft. The report was reviewed by scientists from 13 federal agencies and concludes that Americans are already feeling the effects of climate change. Evidence for a changing climate abounds, from the top of the atmosphere to the depths of the oceans, that draft report reads. A White House official said it will withhold comment on any draft report before its scheduled release date. The assessment is mandated through the 1990 Global Change Research Act. Lead scientists pull together the report and it goes through several rounds of comments, including a critique by the National Academy of Sciences earlier this year. In that review, NAS said the draft report is impressive, timely and generally well-written, and cited its breath, accuracy and rigor. However, scientists involved in the current report are wary that the findings of the final report may not see the light of day. Were in some uncharted waters here, said an author of the report who asked not to be named. Its either going to become an official US government report, or it wont be, in which case we would have to find another outlet for it. The author said that in gathering the report, their guidelines were to provide our best assessment to the present state of knowledge and literature on science itself. The fear about the final destination of the years-long report comes from the overall message emanating from the Trump administration. We have yet to see any pushback, theres been no muzzling, but the uncertainly comes from an obvious place, the author said. If the administration is backing out of the Paris agreement and theres not a strong backing of the idea of human caused climate change, than our report will most surely come into conflict with some of those stated ideas. Andy Rosenberg, director for the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists said the fear is not necessarily a new one. The process has continued to go along. There hasnt been any change in the time line of the process, but given the statements from the administration and from administration officials, theres concern that [the report] will either be edited or held back, he said. Rosenberg has been previously involved in authoring another part of the National Climate Assessment and said the threat to the findings is very real. They could hold back the report, they could in some way modify the conclusions  its a government report, technically they have the power. Whether they have the right is the question, he said. The Global Change Research Act says there has to be a report but the timing isnt mandated in the law.",08/08/2017,https://edition.cnn.com/2017/08/08/politics/climate-change-report/index.html
"Donald Trump doesn? think much of climate change, in 20 quotes","On Monday night, the New York Times published a draft copy of a report from 13 government agencies that affirms climate change is real and human actions are having an effect on the warming of the planet. The Times story notes that scientists say they fear that the Trump administration could change or suppress the report. Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt is an outspoken climate change skeptic, who does not believe carbon dioxide is a major factor in global warming. Trump himself has been an aggressive critic of climate change for years. A search of the invaluable Trump Twitter Archive turns up 106 tweets in which Trump mentions global warming and 36 in which he used the phrase climate change. All of those mentions express serious skepticism about the phenomenon. Trump has tweeted dozens of times about how it is so cold wherever he is and how that debunks the idea the climate is changing. He was also fixated for a time on the idea that scientists were changing the preferred nomenclature from global warming to climate change. I mined through all of those tweets as well as a number of statements Trump has made about climate change. The 20 most dismissive are below in rough chronological order  starting in 2012 with his oldest comments. 1. The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. 2. Its freezing and snowing in New York  we need global warming! 3. Its freezing outside, where the hell is global warming?? 4. I wonder if the Rutgers coach who had the audacity to yell at the player is a proponent of global warming? 5. We should be focused on magnificently clean and healthy air and not distracted by the expensive hoax that is global warming! 6. Wow, its snowing in Isreal and on the pyramids in Egypt. Are we still wasting billions on the global warming con? MAKE U.S. COMPETITIVE! 7. Ice storm rolls from Texas to Tennessee - Im in Los Angeles and its freezing. Global warming is a total, and very expensive, hoax! 8. Give me clean, beautiful and healthy air - not the same old climate change (global warming) bullshit! I am tired of hearing this nonsense. 9. Obama said in his SOTU that global warming is a fact. Sure, about as factual as if you like your healthcare, you can keep it. 10. When will our country stop wasting money on global warming and so many other truly STUPID things and begin to focus on lower taxes? 11. Its late in July and it is really cold outside in New York. Where the hell is GLOBAL WARMING??? We need some fast! Its now CLIMATE CHANGE 12. Just out - the POLAR ICE CAPS are at an all time high, the POLAR BEAR population has never been stronger. Where the hell is global warming? 13. Its really cold outside, they are calling it a major freeze, weeks ahead of normal. Man, we could use a big fat dose of global warming! 14. Wow, 25 degrees below zero, record cold and snow spell. Global warming anyone? 15. Record low temperatures and massive amounts of snow. Where the hell is GLOBAL WARMING? 16. I believe in clean air. Immaculate air. But I dont believe in climate change. 17. Im not a believer in man-made global warming. It could be warming, and its going to start to cool at some point. And you know, in the early, in the 1920s, people talked about global cooling...They thought the Earth was cooling. Now, its global warming...But the problem we have, and if you look at our energy costs, and all of the things that were doing to solve a problem that I dont think in any major fashion exists. 18. Well, I think the climate change is just a very, very expensive form of tax. A lot of people are making a lot of money. I know much about climate change. Id bereceived environmental awards. And I often joke that this is done for the benefit of China. Obviously, I joke. But this is done for the benefit of China, because China does not do anything to help climate change. They burn everything you could burn; they couldnt care less. They have veryyou know, their standards are nothing. But theyin the meantime, they can undercut us on price. So its very hard on our business. 19. Im not supposed to be using hair spray. But think of it. So Obamas always talking about the global warming, that global warming is our biggest and most dangerous problem, OK? 20. I did not. I did not. I do not say that. (see #1) Correction: This post has been changed to correct the year in which Trump denied saying the Chinese created the concept of climate change.",08/08/2017,https://edition.cnn.com/2017/08/08/politics/trump-global-warming/index.html
Trump administration doesn? want to talk about climate change,"Many are avoiding explicitly answering whether the government needs to be more focused on climate change Instead some say the focus needs to be on preparedness and resiliencyClimate change is a ""longer discussion on another day,"" said WH budget chief Mick Mulvaney Last year was the Earths warmest recorded year, the third year in a row to set a new record for global average temperatures. Rising temperatures are likely to increase the intensity and impact of major storms, scientists say, yet in the wake of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, the Trump administration has resisted talking about climate change at all. Several key administration officials have been on message this week declining to discuss the issue and how to address the causes of global warming and increased greenhouse gas emissions. Mick Mulvaney, the director of the White Houses Office of Management and Budget, said climate change is a longer discussion on another day and a big topic for the media. Ill be more than happy to have a longer discussion on another day about climate change, man-made climate change, Mulvaney told CNNs Jake Tapper on The Lead Wednesday. What we are focusing on right now is taking care of the folks who survived this disaster who need our immediate help, he said. Theres plenty of time later on to have those discussions, and I know we will because climate change is clearly a big topic for the media, but we will continue to focus our attention on the folks who need it right now. Both FEMA administrator Brock Long and acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke avoided explicitly answering in CNN interviews Tuesday whether the government needs to be more focused on climate change because of hurricanes such as Harvey and Irma. Both instead said the focus needs to be on preparedness and resiliency. Regardless of what causes disasters, its our job within the Department of Homeland Security and FEMA to manage the consequences, Long told CNN. The only way we become resilient as a nation is we have to create that true culture of preparedness among our citizenry, which we do not have, and then we also have to look how we move forward when it comes to infrastructure protection. Duke echoed Longs thoughts on the need for resiliency, a term frequently used during the administrations storm response. We live in a changing world, and as the FEMA administrator said, we always have to look at not just the response, but the preparedness and the resilience, said Duke. And I think its important that as we come together as a country, we look at the changes in our world and make sure that in planning and response, that we are adapting properly. Pushed about whether the administration should also be looking at the cause of the storm, Duke responded I  you know, the data, I dont know what it particularly indicates. We havent had a major storm like this in a quite a while. Duke added that she had to talk to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration about whether the storms were an anomaly year or a trend year. Global warming will likely cause tropical cyclones to intensify on average globally and add to a larger potential for destruction according to NOAA. Tom Bossert, White House adviser on Homeland Security, was equally remiss to talk about the likely causes of the two hurricanes at a White House briefing Monday. Causality is something outside of my ability to analyze right now, he said. Theres a cyclical nature to a lot of these hurricanes. We continue to take seriously the climate change, not the cause of it, but the things we observe. He added that the White House would have to perform a trend analysis in the future  insinuating that hurricane systems are cyclical and not tied to global warming. President Donald Trump, who pulled the US out of the Paris climate accords earlier this year, has previously called global warming a hoax. When asked whether Trumps personal opinion on climate change has changed at all, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said, I dont think that its changed over the last several weeks, adding that she remains unsure whether the President is reconsidering the Paris deal following the hurricanes. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt told CNN in an interview about Hurricane Irma on Thursday that the time to talk about climate change isnt now  saying the question was insensitive. Heres the issue, Pruitt said. To have any kind of focus on the cause and effect of the storm; versus helping people, or actually facing the effect of the storm, is misplaced. In addition to the administrations efforts to wipe mention of climate change from the federal agency websites, it has proposed cutting EPA funding intended to assist coastal communities in preparing for the impacts of climate change as well as rolled back regulations meant to advise on building against rising sea levels.",12/09/2017,https://edition.cnn.com/2017/09/12/politics/trump-climate-change-silence/index.html
"Yes, climate change made Harvey and Irma worse","The right time to talk climate change is now. It might seem premature when people in the Caribbean, Florida and Texas are still mucking out their flooded homes. And no, changes in our planets atmosphere did not cause Hurricanes Harvey or Irma. But the consensus among scientists is that the effects of climate change, such as rising sea levels and warmer oceans, made those storms far more destructive than they would have been in previous decades. The short version is, climate change makes these very bad storms worse, said Sean Sublette, a meteorologist with Climate Central, a nonprofit group that studies climate change. Its not the proximate cause of the storm, but it makes these bad storms worse. And in the case of a really bad storm, climate change can make it totally disastrous or catastrophic. The data on how our warming planet specifically impacted Harvey and Irma wont be known for quite some time. It can take months and even years to collect and analyze that information. But the science is this: Hurricanes thrive over warm water and strengthen in intensity; oceans have warmed on an average 1 to 3 degrees Fahrenheit over the past century, and sea levels have risen about 7 inches during that time. Throw in compound flooding  the combination of rising sea levels from global warming, storm surge and extreme rainfall  and you have the perfect mix for record flooding. We saw this in greater Houston from Harvey and along the 240-mile stretch of the Atlantic coast from Jacksonville, Florida, to Charleston, South Carolina as a result of Irmas storm surge and heavy rains. Both storms were massive in scope. Harvey dumped a record 51 inches of rainfall as it sat over Texas and Louisiana, saturating the region with 27 trillion gallons of water in six days. Irma was the strongest Atlantic-basin hurricane ever recorded outside the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, spending three days as a Category 5 hurricane, the longest Category 5 on record. Irma maintained winds of 185 mph or above for a total of 37 hours, the most ever for a storm. If this isnt climate change, Miami Mayor Tomas Regalado said as Irma bore down on Florida, I dont know what is. Last week, Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, said it would be insensitive to talk about global warming as Irma took aim at Florida. Other administration officials also refused to address the matter. When asked Thursday whether the recent hurricanes had changed his views on climate change, President Trump said, weve had bigger storms than this  contradicting the hyperbolic language he had used to describe Irma days earlier as it neared Florida. In the past, Trump has said climate change is a hoax. But scientists said that talking climate change amid major storms is in their DNA. In August 2016, prolonged rainfall caused catastrophic and deadly flooding across southeastern Louisiana. A team of scientists studied the storm and determined within weeks that climate change had made it at least 40% more likely to occur. But the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration last month called it premature to conclude that human activities have had a detectable impact on Atlantic hurricane activity, although it added that global warming by the end of the century will probably make tropical storms more intense. Katharine Hayhoe, director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech University, agreed that now is not the time to lecture hard-hit Florida and Texas residents about hurricane preparedness or how their energy consumption might impact the planet. But now is absolutely the time to be having this conversation about climate changes real-time effects, she said. The most dangerous myth that we have bought into as a society is not the myth that climate isnt changing or that humans arent responsible, she said. Its the myth that It doesnt matter to me. And thats why this is absolutely the time to be talking about the way climate change amplifies or exacerbates these natural events. This brings it home. Sublette and Hayhoe said they are all too familiar with the arguments of climate-change deniers. People point to images of devastating hurricanes from the early 1900s as examples of how extreme weather has always been part of coastal living. Or they say things like, You cant even get a weekly forecast correct, let alone predict stuff happening decades from now. But Hayhoe said people shouldnt cherry-pick scientific facts or think that their beliefs somehow trump reality. You can say you dont believe in gravity, but if you step off a cliff, youre going down, she said. Hayhoe and other climate scientists say its important to emphasize their belief that climate change didnt cause Harvey and Irma. No scientist ever said that, Hayhoe said. What you will find is that were basically saying the same thing, which is that climate change exacerbates those risks posed by the storms. For example, Tropical Storm Allison dumped more than 30 inches of rain over Texas in 2001, causing widespread flooding around Houston. But Harvey was an even bigger storm, fueled by warmer waters, than was Allison. As a result, it dumped more than 50 inches of rain on the region, causing massive flooding stretching more than 150 miles from Houston to Lake Charles, Louisiana. Are Irma and Harvey affected by climate change? Absolutely, said CNN senior meteorologist Brandon Miller, who has studied global warming for more than a decade. But everything in the atmosphere now is impacted by the fact that its warmer than its ever been, Miller said. Theres more water vapor in the atmosphere. The ocean is warmer. And all of that really only pushes the impact in one direction, and that is worse: higher surge in storms, higher rainfall in storms. Theres some debate among scientists as to whether future tropical storms will be stronger or more frequent. The intensity, frequency and duration of North Atlantic hurricanes have increased since the early 1980s, according to the most recent National Climate Assessment, a periodic report by a team of more than 300 scientists and other experts. The 2014 report also found that the frequency of the strongest storms  Category 4 and 5 hurricanes  has increased in recent decades. But other scientists say the evidence is less conclusive. The historical Atlantic hurricane record does not provide compelling evidence for a substantial greenhouse warming-induced long-term increase (in storms), said Ryan Maue, a research meteorologist at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. In the future, most scientists say, there wont necessarily be more hurricanes  just the potential for more hurricane-related flooding and destruction. More than 90% of the people doing the research are in very good agreement about whats going on, Sublette said. As we go forward in time, theres going to be a tendency for the hurricanes that do form to have heavier rain and, perhaps, stronger winds. Asked whether its appropriate to talk about climate change while hurricane victims are suffering, Sublette said, The public wants to know, the public has the right to know, and the public wants answers. I think its up to us to give the most scientifically accurate information possible. Hayhoe added, You can say, I dont believe in climate change, but the planet is warming, humans are responsible, and the risks are becoming increasingly serious and even dangerous.",15/09/2017,https://edition.cnn.com/2017/09/15/us/climate-change-hurricanes-harvey-and-irma/index.html
Let? stop debating climate change and start combating it,"Michael Mann: Findings from the National Climate Assessment underscore the serious and ever-growing threat of climate change If we shift the discussion from whether climate change is occurring to how to reduce carbon pollution, we can work to keep global warming in check With the news Tuesday that Syria has officially joined the Paris climate agreement, the United States, under President Trump, will stand as the lone dissenting country when diplomats gather in Germany this week to hammer out the details for implementing the accord. Meanwhile, back at home, the Trump administration must now also confront the newly released US National Climate Assessment, a massive report assembled by hundreds of our nations best scientists, led by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Unlike most science reports, which research the unknowns, the National Climate Assessment is dedicated to assessing the current body of existing science to establish what is known, and how well we know it. The report is the gold standard when it comes to what we know about climate change and its impact in the United States. Its findings underscore climate changes growing and catastrophic threat, including new science that indicates sea levels could rise potentially more than 6 feet by the end of the century  if we continue down our fossil-fueled business-as-usual path. Scientists like me spend most of our time researching and debating the unknowns. The known just isnt that interesting. When it comes to climate change, experts agree (a) that it is occurring and (b) whats causing it  greenhouse gas emissions, aka carbon pollution, mostly from smokestacks and tailpipes. Not surprisingly, then, the leading edge of science has long since moved on to more subtle questions like just how much sea level rise we could see by the end of the century, as well as exactly how quickly hurricanes are intensifying in our warming climate and precisely what role extreme drought and heat are playing in the unprecedented recent wildfires. As the latest science makes clear, uncertainty is not our friend. In the case of sea level rise, we are learning that ice sheets may be more vulnerable to near-term warming, yielding considerably more near-term melt and sea level rise than we had previously estimated. The problem is that the Republicans who are currently in power in Washington, DC are stuck debating the knowns. They have grown more intransigent, raising questions that were literally answered decades ago. That predicament was most recently on display in testimony in front of the US Senate by Congressman Jim Bridenstine, a Republican politician from Oklahoma nominated by President Trump to lead NASA, one of our nations premiere science agencies. When asked about the cause of climate change, Bridenstine could not even cite NASAs own science fingerprinting the role of greenhouse gases in driving warming. Instead he pointed to factors such as solar cycles (in reality, their impact is very small and if anything had a very modest cooling effect in recent decades that slightly offset global warming). When it comes to leading NASA, we must regretfully conclude that Bridenstine has The Wrong Stuff. In this light, and with the United States now standing alone as a dissenter from the Paris accord, the timing of the US National Climate Assessment report could not be better. The report concludes that based on extensive evidence ... it is extremely likely that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th Century. The report also concludes that this period is now the warmest in the history of modern civilization  specifically, the warmest period over at least the past 1,700 years. The report goes on to specify that not only are human activities the dominant cause of global warming, but that those activities are also most probably responsible for ALL of the warming observed over recent decades. The climate would most likely be cooling slightly, due to a downward trend in natural factors, were it not for the overwhelming influence of human activities warming the planet. Sea level rise is a good example of the choices facing us. The National Climate Assessment reports that an extraordinarily rapid shift to a clean energy economy would limit sea level rise by 2100 to about 2 feet. Alternatively, if we continue down the business-as-usual path, sea level rise could exceed six feet by 2100. In these projections you can see that, due to the delay in curbing carbon pollution, we are now facing sea level rise over the coming decades what will cost us tens of billions, if not more. Further delay that commits us to sea level rise of just six feet would, according to calculations released by the real estate firm Zillow based on a 2016 study, swallow about 1.9 million US homes  about 2% of all US homes, worth a combined $882 billion  by the end of the century. Fortunately, the report also points out that we still have a choice. With significant reductions in carbon pollution, we can hold warming in check. But how we go about doing that is an open question. Thats what policymakers in Washington should be arguing about. Continuing to argue about whats causing the planet to warm is the moral equivalent of arguing over whether wood burns while a fire is climbing up out of the basement of your house. Its time Republicans stop arguing and got out the hoses instead.",08/11/2017,https://edition.cnn.com/2017/11/07/opinions/climate-report-opinion-mann/index.html
"Far-fetched fixes for climate change, from solar shields to air-scrubbing","In the battle against climate change, efforts to reduce emissions of harmful gases like carbon dioxide have consumed most of the headlines. But many scientists say that simply minimizing man-made pollution is not enough to limit global warming to two degrees Celsius, as agreed in the 2015 Paris climate agreement  humans must also devise other means to help cool the planet. Theres no shortage of imaginative proposals to achieve this goal. Some involve sucking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere; others, including a giant space-based solar shield, would reduce the amount of sunlight that reaches Earth. While many of these solutions are considered radical and impractical, others have been operational for years. But given their often high costs, significant side effects, vast scale and international impact, theres plenty of skepticism about the viability of the existing options. Theres no way around reducing emissions, said Stefan Schaefer, climate engineering program leader at the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies in Potsdam, Germany. Without that, none of the techniques can do anything useful. None of them can be a silver bullet, he added. But investing some money to research these approaches makes sense. Here are some of the existing technologies and a look at how realistic they are. While some projects remove carbon dioxide at its source  such as power stations or gas fields  before it enters the atmosphere, direct air capture (DAC) involves taking CO2 out of the air and storing it, often in underground reservoirs. Chemical techniques for capturing CO2  such as scrubbing (using an alkaline to absorb CO2)  are already being used in power stations and could be transferable to DAC projects. Other suggested methods include using artificial trees to suck up carbon or building towers that suck in air and filter out the CO2. Pros: Cons: How realistic is it? Unlike some other technologies, DAC has made it beyond the drawing board. The worlds first commercially operational DAC plant opened in Switzerland in May. Fans suck air into filters that absorb carbon dioxide. The gas is then piped into greenhouses and used as fertilizer to grow crops. But Schaefer is skeptical about the scope of this technology: The question with direct air capture is: how much can it actually achieve? How much CO2 can it actually remove from the atmosphere? And to what extent would you have to scale it up to impact the global climate? Building hundreds or thousands of DAC plants would take vast amounts of energy and materials and produce CO2 in the process, contributing to the problem the plants are meant to help solve. Richard Darton, emeritus professor and co-director of the Oxford Geoengineering Programme at the University of Oxford, is more hopeful. He said that if the plants themselves use renewable energy to run, their carbon footprint could be very small. It may seem outdated, but tree planting is a vital tool in the battle against climate change and one of the simplest possible solutions. While reforestation reintroduces trees to land only recently deforested, afforestation means planting trees in areas that have been without forests for a long time (or have never supported forests). Trees take in and store carbon dioxide, reducing the concentration of the gas in the atmosphere. Pros: Cons: How realistic is it? A useful first step is to stop cutting down trees in the first place, Schaefer said. Thats still happening on a large scale. Darton agrees, and he sees great value in encouraging afforestation on land thats suitable. But the new areas of forest have to be vast to influence global climate  generating the problems described above  and the positive effects are not permanent. Theres always the problem that over the lifetime of the forest, carbon will go back into the atmosphere, said Darton. It may gain us the decades we need, but over the long term its not a solution. Adding more lime or other alkaline materials into the ocean could be another way of removing CO2 from the air. This technology is known as ocean alkalinity enhancement. Rocks such as limestone or silicates would be ground up and dispersed in the ocean to increase its ability to store carbon. The limestone is first quarried then broken down into quicklime at high temperatures in a process that also produces carbon dioxide. But if that quicklime is then dumped into seawater, scientists say it can absorb around twice as much CO2 as was released in the first reaction. Pros: Cons: How realistic is it? More and more people are becoming interested in this technology, explained Schaefer, who said that tackling ocean acidification is something that few other geoengineering options can do. But both Schaefer and Darton are fearful of the effects on the worlds seas. Many of us are quite nervous about distributing chemicals into the maritime environment, said Darton. We dont know an awful lot about the sea and how it will react to changes in chemistry. To make any significant inroads in carbon reduction, ocean alkalinity enhancement would have to be deployed on a very large scale. Darton said more research was needed into the longer term effects of this approach. Im doubtful that this is something we could or should do in the long term, he said. Back in 1989, American James Early suggested putting a giant sunshade in space to offset the effect of greenhouse gases in the Earths atmosphere. He envisioned a glass refractor so large and heavy it would have to be built on the moon. More recent proposals designed to reduce the amount of sunlight reaching our planet include a swarm of thin metallic reflecting discs, a Saturn-like ring of dust particles injected into space from Earth, or a superfine mesh of aluminum threads. Scientists estimate that reducing the amount of sunlight reaching Earth by just 2% could offset the effects of CO2 levels in the atmosphere doubling. Pros: Cons: How realistic is it? Right now this is far more science fiction than anything else, said Schaefer. At some point in the future it might be something people would consider, but thats a long way down the road. Any space-based solar shield would face huge financial costs and logistical problems, he explained. Darton pointed out another problem, common to solar radiation management projects. If you turn them off, all the modeling shows that the temperature rises very rapidly, he said. If we implement these technologies, were wedded to them. Aerosols are tiny particles  less than a millionth of a meter wide  suspended in the atmosphere. Man-made aerosols exist in hairspray and spray paint, but they come from natural sources too. Many natural aerosols found in the atmosphere scatter light from the sun, sending some of the suns energy back into space. This process exerts a cooling effect on the earths climate. By artificially injecting sulfate particles  a type of aerosol  into the atmosphere using fighter planes or giant balloons, scientists could increase the amount of sunlight sent back into space and intensify the cooling effect. Pros: Cons: How realistic is it? Schaefer doesnt think well see this technology within the next few years. In fact, it would be a very concerning development, he added. The technical side of things doesnt seem that difficult to resolve, Schaefer said, but what seems much more difficult is the social and political side. Thats basically insurmountable. Even if one country funds and implements an aerosol program, the consequences could be felt around the world. Who would take responsibility for harms caused by such an intervention? Schaefer asked.",29/11/2017,https://edition.cnn.com/2017/11/29/world/climate-change-geoengineering/index.html
Paris Agreement two years on: Who is taking the lead on climate change?,"Paris Agreement struck two years ago this weekPresident Trump pulled US out in MayAll other countries committed to climate pact Two years ago this week, representatives from close to 200 countries gathered in the French capital and pledged to take decisive action on climate change. The Paris Agreement pushed signatories to reduce their carbon output and halt global warming below two degrees Celsius by the end of the century. The deal was heralded as the end of the era of fossil fuels and a victory for all of the planet over the days that followed. Yet under 18 months later the United States, the worlds largest economy and second biggest carbon emitter, confirmed it was pulling out of the agreement. While former President Barack Obama described the Paris accord as best chance we have to save the one planet that weve got, his successor, President Donald Trump, has been far from as complimentary. The climate pact was shaped around voluntary commitments reviewed and reassessed every five years. But Trump has stated he sees the agreement as unfair to the US and bad for American jobs. As things stand, the US will be the only country in the world not signed on to the accord when it completes the lengthy withdrawal process in 2020. Mark Lynas, a British author, journalist and environmental activist who focuses on climate change, says Trumps decision has only served to galvanize the rest of the world. Its also left the stage clear for other leaders to come to the fore on the issue. French President Emmanuel Macron invited scientists, entrepreneurs and NGO workers to move to his country shortly after Trump announced the US would be walking away from the Paris text. Macron also vowed to Make Our Planet Great Again, a pointed play on Trumps Make America Great Again slogan. Elsewhere, Indias prime minister Narendra Modi said it would be a morally criminal act for the world not to do its part on climate change. Both the European Union and China, meanwhile, have vowed to push forward with the Paris Agreement. Chinese President Xi Jinping even spoke of his country becoming a torch bearer for ecological issues at the Chinese Communist Party Congress in October. At the recent COP 23 event in Bonn, Germany, representatives from over 190 countries gathered to discuss the next stages of implementation of the Paris Agreement and how commitments could be increased. Cassie Flynn, a global climate change adviser at the UN Development Programme, says these developments show that the momentum around the Paris Agreement certainly continues. A lot of the worlds smaller and less developed nations are also stepping up to the plate and pushing to lead on the issues, Flynn adds  a fact emphasized by Pacific island nation of Fiji presiding over COP 23. According to Climate Action Tracker, the world remains a significant way off meeting its emission reductions goals even with American cooperation. The independent group of research bodies, which estimates the cuts countries need to make to prevent two degrees of warming, calculates a jump of 3.2 degrees before the end of the century when existing pledges are factored in. The head of the UN Environment Agency, Erik Solheim, acknowledged as much last month when he wrote that current pledges cover no more than a third of the emission reductions needed. Lynas says it has been much more difficult to transition away from fossil fuels than anyone thought while scaling up renewables has not happened as fast as envisioned. This makes him concerned about the difficulties ahead in ensuring the two degrees target is met even with the political will to do so. Flynn, however, is more optimistic. She believes Paris has provided the basic framework required for countries to work together. However, ambitions need to be increased as quickly as possible ... (to) keep our emissions down and increase our resilience to climate change, she adds. Some believe US withdrawal could still affect how the Paris pact develops. Rob Bailey, research director on energy, environment and resources at the UKs Chatham House think tank, says one of the key reasons a meaningful agreement was struck in Paris was American and Chinese cooperation. This made clear early on that the two biggest polluters in the world  China accounts for 28% of global carbon emissions from fuel combustion and the US 15%, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists  were on board. With America gone, Bailey questions whether China can be as ambitious without the dynamic created by another major partner like the US. He highlights the difficulties engulfing other potential partners such as the EU which is politically preoccupied with the likes of Brexit and the refugee crisis. Lynas, however, believes that China has signaled it will exploit its role as a global leader on this issue and would find support from the most of the rest of the world should it do so. Taking the lead on climate will also likely play well domestically for President Xi given pollution is a major issue in many cities, Lynas adds. Former President Obama recently described the leaders of cities, states and non-profits as the new leadership on climate change. Obama was speaking at an event in Chicago where mayors from around the world signed on to a charter that looked to emulate the Paris agreement from a city rather than nation-state level. Many American mayors and governors have rejected Trumps isolationism on the issue. Former mayor of New York City, Michael Bloomberg, and California governor, Jerry Brown, founded Americas Pledge  an initiative that aims to bring together states, cities, businesses, universities, and citizens to ensure the US delivers on its Paris Agreement goals. Lynas says that cities in the US are keep(ing) the flame alive for the time being while Flynn also highlights the work done in other major cities like London and Paris as they aim to reduce emissions. On top of that, she points to the realization among private firms and some of the worlds biggest businesses that addressing climate change is simply good business. Even with major companies, cities and nation states on board, however, its clear the battle to meet the ambitious targets of the Paris Agreement is only just beginning.",12/12/2017,https://edition.cnn.com/2017/12/12/world/climate-change-paris-agreement-two-years/index.html
Three ways MLK speaks to our time,"Every hero becomes a bore at last. Thats a famous line from the 19th century philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson, but it could also apply to a modern American hero: the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. As the nation celebrates Kings national holiday Monday, its easy to freeze-frame him as the benevolent dreamer carved in stone on the Washington Mall. Yet the platitudes that frame many King holiday events often fail to mention the most radical aspects of his legacy, says Jeanne Theoharis, a political science professor at Brooklyn College and author of several books on the civil rights movement. We turn him into a Thanksgiving parade float, hes jolly, larger than life and he makes us feel good, Theoharis says. Weve turned him into a mascot. Many people vaguely know that King opposed the Vietnam War and talked more about poverty in his later years. But King also had a lot to say about issues not normally associated with civil rights that still resonate today, historians and activists say. If youre concerned about inequality, health care, climate change or even the nastiness of our political disagreements, then King has plenty to say to you. To see that version of King, though, we have to dust off the cliches and look at him anew. If youre more familiar with your smartphone than your history, try this: Think of King not just as a civil rights hero, but also as an app  his legacy has to be updated to remain relevant. Here are three ways we can update our MLK app to see how he spoke not only to his time, but to our time as well: When former Attorney General Eric Holder spoke at a King commemorative event in 2011, he described King in an unusual way: King, he said, helped plant the seeds for what would become our nations now-thriving environmental justice movement. People dont think of King as an ecological activist. He didnt live long enough to see the environmental movement take off. He died just a few months before the Apollo 8 astronauts took the iconic Earthrise photo over the moon, which is often credited with sparking widespread environmental awareness.. But he still inspires environmental activists because they say he was so eloquent in articulating a core belief of their movement: the interconnected nature of life. One of the most difficult challenges climate change activists face today is convincing political and business leaders to act on behalf of future generations and people in other parts of the world. King, though, offers a great example of how to address this challenge, some say. He constantly talked about the interconnectedness of life. In his A Christmas Sermon on Peace just five months before his assassination, King delivered one of his most famous quotes: All life is interrelated. We are all caught in an inescapable network of mutuality. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly. We are made to live together because of the interrelated structure of reality. Some even describe King as an ecological hero. Activist and author Drew Dellinger says Kings insight is profound. Thats the essence of ecology, says Dellinger, who wrote an essay for Common Ground magazine entitled, Martin Luther King Jr.: Ecological Thinker. The first law of ecology is that everything is connected. Other environmental activists have noticed King as well. In his essay, Dellinger cites Larry L. Rasmussen, author of Earth-honoring Faith and a professor emeritus of social ethics at Union Theological Seminary, describing King as one of the great ecological thinkers of the 20th century. King wrote more about nature and the fragility of life on Earth than people realize, says Dellinger. King once warned that cities are gasping in polluted air and enduring contaminated water. Dellinger also cites this quote from King: It would be foolhardy for me to work for integrated schools or integrated lunch counters and not be concerned about the survival of the world in which to be integrated. When he was pouring through Kings sermons and books, Dellinger says, he discovered constant references to science and nature. He came across notecards written in Kings hand rhapsodizing about all this galaxy of wonder and stars that guide sailors in storms. Theres a connection between what King was saying in the 1950s and 60s and this explosion of ecological thinking that emerged around 1970, where everyone was saying its all about interconnectedness, Dellinger says. Gwendolyn Keyes Fleming, a former EPA regional administrator who wrote about Kings environmental legacy, says King also inspired a generation of activists in the 1970s and 80s who fought to remove landfills that had been placed near communities of color. If you go back to the beginnings of the environmental justice movement, a lot of those folks were active civil rights advocates at the time, says Keys, now a partner in the DC law firm of Van Ness Feldman. Even Congressman John Lewis said that environmental justice is one of the modern civil rights issues of our time. There was a time in American politics when calling someone a socialist was a slur. Not anymore, at least for many younger Americans who are developing a distrust of capitalism. One of the most popular politicians in recent times is Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a self-described Democratic Socialist who almost captured the Democratic nomination for president. A 2016 Harvard University poll said 51% of young Americans  18- to-29-year-olds  oppose capitalism. And a poll conducted the next year by YouGov and the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation found that most American millennials preferred to live in a socialist country than a capitalist one. The reasons why some millennials prefer socialism have been documented. Lingering scars from the Great Recession; staggering student debt; the greatest economic inequality since before the Great Depression  all have contributed to an unease about capitalism. King had similar misgivings. Many historians describe him as a democratic socialist, someone who, according to the Democratic Socialists of America, believes the economy should be shaped to meet public needs and not to make profits for a few. King called for universal health care and education, a guaranteed annual income and the nationalization of some industries. He was a big supporter of unions, and while there was no Fight for 15 campaign to raise the minimum wage during his time, he once said even menial workers should make enough so they can live and educate their children and buy a home and have the basic necessities of life. When King was assassinated in 1968, he was about lead a multiracial army of poor people into Washington to force the nations political leaders to address poverty. He saw that changing the laws was important but that was not in itself sufficient, says Jerald Podair, a history professor at Lawrence University in Wisconsin. There had to be some sort of redistribution of economic power. How radical was Kings vision? He spelled out it on many occasions: In 1968, he told a church audience: It didnt cost the nation a penny to open lunch counters. It didnt cost the nation a penny to give us the right to vote. But it will cost the nation billions to feed and house all of its citizens. The country needs a radical redistribution of wealth. In a 1966 speech to his staff, he said: There must be a better distribution of wealth, and maybe America must move toward a democratic socialism. In 1964, after traveling to Norway to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, King said: In both Norway and Sweden, whose economies are literally dwarfed by the size of our affluence and the extent of our technology, they have no unemployment and no slums. There, men, women and children have long enjoyed free medical care and quality education. This contrast to the limited, halting steps taken by our rich nation deeply troubled me. Even one of King s most utopian visions  a guaranteed income  is getting serious discussion today because of fears that automation will erase many jobs. Theres even a new proposal to give every newborn in the US Baby Bonds, accounts between $500 and $50,000 that parents couldnt touch until their kids turn 18, as a way to combat inequality. There are those who say King gravitated toward socialism later in his life. But like many Americans today, he saw its possibilities first as a young man. In a letter to his future wife, Coretta Scott, a 20-something King wrote: I imagine you already know that I am much more socialistic in my economic theory than capitalistic ... So today capitalism has outlived its usefulness. It has brought about a system that takes necessities from the masses to give luxuries to the classes. Reverend Dr. Chickenwing. A religious Uncle Tom. A traitor and a chump. Thats how one prominent black leader described King when he was alive. That leader was Malcolm X. While his denunciations of King and other leaders is well known, heres a remarkable fact: There is virtually no record of King making a personal or petty attack against Malcolm X or any other black leaders who criticized him. This could be an important lesson at a time of bitter political divisions, which are often made worse by social media. Two contemporary leaders in the civil rights movement recently got involved in a Twitter feud that turned personal. The clash between Harvard professor Cornel West and award-winning Ta-Nehisi Coates revolved around political philosophy. But it became so heated that Coates ended up deleting his Twitter account. King received a cascade of petty insults from Malcolm X and other black leaders during his time, but Kings faith tempered his response, says Podair, the historian. He was a Christian minister, and he talked about trying to love segregationists, and if you try to have empathy for your enemies, you can also do that with your rivals in civil rights organizations, says Podair , who writes about race in his latest book, City of Dreams: Dodger Stadium and the Birth of Modern Los Angeles. There was also a pragmatic side to Kings reluctance to get pulled into public feuds. It preserved alliances and kept the door open to new allies  including Malcolm X. After Malcolm broke with the Nation of Islam in 1964, he started reaching out to King and other civil rights leaders. He traveled to Selma, Alabama, in 1965, where King was leading the march to Montgomery, to offer support. A friend of Malcolm once said the former Nation of Islam leader believed King would be the most responsive of all civil rights leaders to his efforts to reconcile. He had come to believe that King believed in what he was doing, A. Peter Bailey told CNN in 2010 He believed in nonviolence; it just wasnt a show. He developed respect for him. I heard him say you have to give respect to men who put their lives on the line. The respect was mutual. When King later learned that Malcolm X had come to Selma to support him, he was quoted as saying, Hey, that Malcolm is a beautiful brother. He always had a deep affection for Malcolm, says Jacob Udo-Udo Jacob, a visiting international scholar in international studies at Dickinson College in Pennsylvania. Malcolm obviously challenged and did say many unkind words about Kings philosophy of nonviolence, but their disagreements never turned personal or nasty. Kings magnanimous nature didnt just help him deal with other black leaders insults. It also helped him deal with something people today may find hard to believe: He was persistently unpopular during his lifetime, says Theoharis, the Brooklyn College political science professor and author of A More Beautiful and Terrible History: The Uses and Misuses of Civil Rights History. One of the things that people erase from history is how unpopular and scared of Dr. King most Americans were at the times, she says. Im not just talking about in 67 and 68, but Im talking about in the early 60s. Theoharis cites Kings most transcendent moment: The 1963 March on Washington and his I have a Dream speech. Polls showed that most Americans didnt approve of the march, and the following year  well before the 1965 Voting Rights Act was passed  a New York Times poll showed that most Americans thought the civil rights movement had gone too far. The US government thought King was so dangerous they treated him like an enemy of the state. We now see his March on Washington speech as the greatest American speech of the 20th century, she says, but were uncomfortable grappling with the fact that this is the moment that the FBI decided to have wall-to-wall surveillance of Dr. King. Today we have wall-to-wall celebrations about King. Hes now on par with American titans like Presidents George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. Americans write tributes and sing songs about how much King has changed America. But heres one more uncomfortable thought that also explains why King remains so relevant: The country is still divided by many of the same issues that consumed him. On the last night of his life, King told a shouting congregation of black churchgoers that we as a people would get to the Promised Land. That kind of optimism, though, sounds like it belongs to another era. What we have now is a leader in the White House who denies widespread reports that he complained about Latino and African immigrants coming to America from shithole countries; a white supremacist who murders worshippers in church; a social media landscape that pulsates with anger and accusations. Kings Promised Land doesnt sound boring when compared to todays headlines. And maybe thats whats so sad about reliving his life every January for some people. Fifty years after he died, Kings vision for America still sounds so far away.",12/01/2018,https://edition.cnn.com/2018/01/12/us/mlk-relevance-today/index.html
EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt suggests climate change could benefit humans,"Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt suggested Tuesday that climate change could benefit humans, despite scientific evidence to the contrary. In an interview with KSNV in Las Vegas, Pruitt conceded that climate change is a reality and humans have contributed to it to a certain degree. However, the EPA administrator cast doubt on its negative long-term implications. Is it an existential threat? Is it something that is unsustainable, or what kind of effect or harm is this going to have? I mean, we know that humans have most flourished during times of what? Warming trends, Pruitt said. I think theres assumptions made that because the climate is warming, that that necessarily is a bad thing. Do we really know what the ideal surface temperature should be in the year 2100? In the year 2018? I mean its fairly arrogant for us to think that we know exactly what it should be in 2100. The current scientific consensus, according to NASA, is that humans are the primary drivers of climate-warming trends, and that it is proceeding at a rate unprecedented over decades to millennia. Some of the long-term effects of climate change include a continuing increase in global temperatures, more droughts and heatwaves, stronger and more intense hurricanes, and rising sea levels. According to the US Global Change Research Programs National Climate Assessment, climate change presents a global public health problem, with serious health impacts predicted to manifest in varying ways in different parts of the world. Public health in the US can be affected by disruptions of physical, biological, and ecological systems, the report explains. Health effects of these disruptions include increased respiratory and cardiovascular disease, injuries and premature deaths related to extreme weather events, changes in the prevalence and geographical distribution of food- and waterborne illnesses and other infectious diseases, and threats to mental health. The US has seen a stark shift in its approach to climate change under the Trump administration and at the EPA under Pruitts leadership. Pruitt has shied away from robust action on climate change, and the phrase climate change was not included in the agencys four-year plan.",08/02/2018,https://edition.cnn.com/2018/02/08/politics/scott-pruitt-climate-change/index.html
"11,000 years ago, our ancestors survived abrupt climate change","Hunter-gatherers survived abrupt climate change eventsData combined human activity and climate record analysisClimate change would impact modern lives in different ways, expert says Imagine if, instead of heat this summer, we were faced with a sudden, dramatic cold front that lasted the next 100 years. That is what our hunter-gatherer ancestors lived through 11,000 years ago. Findings from a Middle Stone Age site named Star Carr in North Yorkshire, England, show that our ancestors resiliently survived the century-long drop in temperature, according to a new study in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution on Monday. How they responded to such abrupt climate change could hold key insights for us as we face a different kind of climate change, the researchers said. Paleoclimatologists, who study climates of the past, know that Earths climate was not as stable for our ancestors as it has been for us. These abrupt, harsh changes could mean life or death, often forcing whole populations to move if they wanted to survive. For example, one well-studied event 8,200 years ago was a sudden cold shift that lasted over a century, recorded in Greenland ice cores and within the fossil record across Europe, the researchers said. It occurred when the North American ice sheet decayed after the last ice age and released meltwater into the North Atlantic Ocean, disrupting the currents that brought heat to Western Europe. This triggered large-scale population crashes in northern Britain and large cultural changes in southern Europe, they said. In studying the Star Carr site, the researchers learned that two events there 9,300 and 11,100 years ago resulted in temperature decreases of 10 and 4 degrees Celsius. The population at Star Carr, some of the earliest people to recolonise Britain after the last ice age, must have been highly resilient to climate instability, capable of persevering and maintaining a stable society in spite of these environmental stresses, Ian Candy, study author and professor of geography at the Royal Holloway University of Londons Centre for Quaternary Research, wrote in an email. These conclusions really change the way that we think about the interaction between prehistoric societies and climate change. The abrupt climatic events seen at Star Carr are as large, if not larger, in magnitude as the (event 8,200 years ago) and yet here we confidently show that the populations at Star Carr were resilient to the impact of such events. These hunter-gatherers had a lot of skills and knowledge of how to use the natural resources. They could make shelters and houses and hunt, fish and collect plant materials. It must have been a lot colder and harsher conditions to live in but they had structures and used fires to keep warm, and seem to have had access to animals such as red deer. The climate change would have cooled both summer and winter temperatures. This also wouldve affected the landscape and caused it to be more unstable, pausing the development of the woodland environment the hunter-gatherers depended on. During the first event, the site was populated on only a very small scale. The researchers have no way of knowing whether the climate change event was the cause of this. But during the second event, Star Carr was a home to many hunter-gatherers, and despite the climate shift, they did not change their way of life or abandon the site. And according to the researchers, red deer  which provided the people with skins, meat and other products  would not have been affected by the temperature change, meaning the hunter-gatherers still had access to them. Star Carr has been a treasure trove for researchers from around the world since it was first excavated in the late 1940s. This site, at the edge of a former lake basin, includes the oldest evidence for carpentry in Europe: large wooden platforms made from wood worked with flint tools. Eleven thousand years ago, it wouldve been open landscape made up of grasslands, shrub and woodlands. It is also the site of the earliest evidence for built structures in Britain, including raised circular wooden structures thought to be houses. And rare artifacts, like a plentiful number of red deer antler headdresses and masks, are intriguing. Bones, flints, shale beads and antler headdresses have been recovered at what wouldve been in the lakes edge of these former wetlands. The reed swamp wouldve been rich in plants and animals, before the standing water became more shallow and boggy. The peat has helped preserve the artifacts, but its deteriorating as the water table changes. The researchers were assessing the damage done at the site due to these changes and racing to recover artifacts before they were lost, Candy said. At the moment this site remains unique because of the wealth of data found there, Candy wrote. We have now found over 30 antler headdresses from the site  there are no other sites in the UK where these have been found and only a few are known from a couple of sites in Germany: so they are extraordinarily rare. It is not often you find sites with this level of preservation  usually only the stone tools survive  and whilst stone tools can still tell us a lot about past lives, the organic remains provide a much more detailed picture. The researchers discovered the detail of the climate change events by building a record of what happened at the site. Lake deposits, fossilized plants and animals, radiocarbon dating, ash from volcanic eruptions and other archaeological data allowed them to match the climate record alongside human activity at the site for the first time. But they didnt find human bones, which leaves the researchers wondering how these hunter-gatherers dealt with their dead. The findings at Star Carr change how the researchers look at hunter-gatherer populations. Generally it was thought that hunter gatherers were fairly mobile, Candy said. We now know they built structures very early on after the end of the Ice Age, and that they were fairly settled. The antler headdresses are most intriguing. They seem to have been used and deposited in the shallow waters both during the climatic downturn and after it. We cant ever be sure what they were used for, but a lot of work has gone into making them and from ethnographic analogy one possibility is that they were used by shamans as part of their costumes. Resilient ancestors who could survive climate change events and cope with extremes sounds promising  but there are other factors to consider when looking ahead to our own changing world, Candy said. The total population and the density of these prehistoric populations would have been tiny in comparison to Britain at the present day, Candy said. Our current population puts a much greater pressure on the resources that we are reliant on, many of which will be effected by future climate change. Furthermore, the people of Star Carr were part of a tradition that had experienced dramatic climate shifts at the end of the last age, extreme climatic instability was part of their way of life. In contrast, our society has existed through many centuries or even millennia of stable climates, we have no experience of sudden large-scale change. Whereas our ancestors lived through transformations of landscape and ecology, climate change would impact many more things that affect our daily life, said Sam White, history associate professor at The Ohio State University. White, who has written about environmental and climate history, was not affiliated with the new study. For our modern society, there are so many more people at risk and more vulnerabilities to consider: modern infrastructure and cities at risk of rising sea levels, agriculture unsuited for warmer seasons and more drought, moving disease vectors, lost biodiversity and ecosystem services, and so on, White wrote in an email. Its good to hear stories of adaptation and resilience, and not just crisis and collapse. But we need to be cautious with either. Mark Carey, a professor of history and environmental studies at the University of Oregon, pointed out that its key to focus on the fact that societal change and climate change are a complex relationship, and that societal changes are not always in direct response to climate change. Such analyses of past climate-society dynamics can illuminate where and why problems emerged or successes occurred in response to abrupt climatic changes, such as this case at Star Carr, said Carey, who was not involved in the new research. The depth of archaeological and climatic evidence presented in this study takes us in a positive step to show how societies adjust in the face of abrupt climatic change. It also sets up the next level of research to probe decision making and cause-effect dynamics, allowing researchers to go beyond the correlation of events (climate change and societal change) and toward causal explanations for how and why societies persevere in the face of climate change. Dagomar Degroot, professor of environmental history at Georgetown University and co-founder of the Climate History Network, is among the researchers finding evidence of resilience in the face of past climate change events. Studies of this kind show correlation much better than they reveal causation, so its difficult to know how exactly the people of Star Carr successfully endured even the most extreme climate changes, wrote Degroot, who was not involved in the study, in an email. Still, these dramatic results suggest that, in the wake of the great Ice Ages, past climate changes rarely determined the course of human history in a straightforward way. In my opinion, this article has great significance for our understanding of anthropogenic global warming. Though climate change will play a major role in shaping our future, humans are also adaptive and capable of rapid solutions, Degroot said. With that said, vulnerability to climate change is about the scale and speed of climate change, on the one hand, and the characteristics of a society, on the other, he said. In this last sense, our plight is most different from that of our ancestors at Star Carr. We live well beyond the carrying capacity of our planet, in ways the resilient inhabitants of Star Carr certainly didnt. Only time will tell regarding our own future response to the various impacts of climate change. Whether we have the potential to show the same resilience to sudden extreme climate change as the people of Star Carr is yet to be tested, Candy said.",26/03/2018,https://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/26/health/climate-change-hunter-gatherers/index.html

Climate change has loomed over my every life decision, every time I try to plan for the future. When I think of the future, I cant assume stability or safety. When I think of adulthood, I see my home being flooded, I see deathly heat waves, droughts, famine and intense, deadly storms. I see insects, allergens, and diseases spreading to places where they shouldnt naturally be. I see countless people dying from toxic drinking water, food full of chemicals, and air thick with pollutants. I see millions upon millions of refugees fleeing homes in regions that have become uninhabitable. I see wars and conflict over dwindling resources. Theres never been a time in my life when the scientific consensus was not that humans were changing the earths climate. My life, and that of my entire generation, is full of ifs. I want to see all the worlds natural wonders  if those natural wonders will still be around when Im an adult. I want to serve in political office  if our democracy will still be intact.

"Pediatricians are concerned about climate change, and here? why","Children worldwide are estimated to bear 88% of the burden of disease tied to climate changeA new paper calls for more research and preparedness plans to address deadly health risks Doctors have long raised alarm about the potential health risks of climate change, but it turns out that children are particularly vulnerable. Children are estimated to bear 88% of the burden of disease related to climate change, according to a paper published Tuesday in the journal Pediatrics. The new paper highlights some studies on the implications of climate change for childrens health and then calls for the world to better prepare for these health risks, not just in the future but in the present. We already have seen the impacts, said Dr. Kevin Chan, chairman of pediatrics at Memorial University and head of child health at Eastern Health in Canada, who co-authored the paper. Chan pointed to Hurricanes Katrina, Harvey and Irma as examples of climate change-related weather events that have affected childrens health, along with extreme heat waves and emerging infectious pathogens such as the Zika virus. During pregnancy, Zika infection can cause a serious birth defect called microcephaly, a condition in which a babys head is smaller than expected and the brain has not developed properly. There is no treatment for microcephaly that can return a childs head to a healthy size or shape. Alerts of an outbreak of Zika, spread mostly by mosquitoes, emerged in 2015 and continued through 2016. Some studies suggest that increased climate instability has contributed to the emergence and spread of mosquito-borne infections like Zika. Absolutely, that was one that disproportionately affected children, Chan said of Zika. The basic message is that climate change is occurring, and I think it disproportionately affects the most vulnerable populations, and that includes children, he said. In the new paper, Chan and co-author Dr. Rebecca Pass Philipsborn, a member of the pediatrics faculty at the Emory University School of Medicine, cited a separate study that found that deaths due to diarrhea, malaria and nutritional deficiencies among children younger than 5 accounted for 38%, 65% and 48% of all global deaths, respectively, in 2015. That study was published in The Lancet in 2016. The new study reports that those causes of death can be climate-sensitive. For instance, certain changes in climate can make it more suitable for the transmission of malaria, a mosquito-borne disease caused by a parasite transmitted through the bite of infected mosquitoes. Similarly, climbing temperatures have been tied to an increased incidence of waterborne bacterial infections that cause diarrhea. When compared with a future without climate change, an estimated 48,000 additional deaths due to diarrheal illness are projected among children younger than 15 by 2030, according to the World Health Organization. As for nutritional deficiencies, about 95,000 additional deaths due to childhood undernutrition are projected for 2030, according to the WHO. Extremely high seasonal temperatures and extreme weather events could damage crops, impacting the food supply and thus childhood nutrition. In their paper, Chan and Philipsborn also referenced studies on childrens vulnerability to extreme heat, droughts and air pollution. A separate report, published last year by the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health, mapped how those climate change-related events and others threaten the health of people across the United States  and those threats can vary by region. Dr. Mona Sarfaty, executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health and director of the program on climate and health at George Mason Universitys Center for Climate Change Communication, said the the sources for the new Pediatrics paper are credible and well-known to experts on climate change and health. The danger to children is real and is already witnessed by physicians in the US, said Sarfaty, who was not involved in the paper. Children suffer more heat impacts because they spend more time outside. They are more vulnerable to the heat-related increases in air pollution that come from fossil fuel exhaust, because their lungs are still developing. Outdoor play also makes them more prey to insect vectors carrying dangerous infections, she said. The doctors in our societies are seeing these problems today, and they will undoubtedly get worse if we dont decisively address climate change. Though the new paper highlights the current body of research on climate change and childrens health, Chan said that more research could help physicians better understand and prepare for the health impacts of climate change. Specifically, what we wanted to highlight was, theres very little research and evidence around children, Chan said. A lot of the research is very, very broad and tends to look more at adult populations. I dont think they factor in the specific impacts on children themselves, and I think more research is needed in that arena, he said. We really need more efforts into addressing climate change to protect our children. In 2015, the American Academy of Pediatrics published an updated policy statement on global climate change and childrens health, calling for health facilities to reduce their carbon and environmental footprints and for politicians to promote energy efficiency, among other recommendations. Climate change is a rising public health threat to all children in this country and around the world, former academy President Dr. Sandra G. Hassink said in a news release at the time. Pediatricians have a unique and powerful voice in this conversation due to their knowledge of child health and disease and their role in ensuring the health of current and future children, she said.",08/05/2018,https://edition.cnn.com/2018/05/08/health/climate-change-children-pediatrics-study/index.html
Record-breaking summer marches on to the beat of climate change,"Summer has brought record heat waves this month on four continents""The impacts of climate change are no longer subtle,"" one expert says The summer of temperature extremes just keeps going, with record heat waves this month on all four continents that occupy the non-tropical Northern Hemisphere where it is now summer. On Monday, Japan recorded a temperature never before reached on the island nation since reliable records began in the 1800s. Kumagaya, a city only 40 miles from Tokyo, hit 41.1 degrees Celsius (106 degrees Fahrenheit) in the midst of a multiweek heat wave that has killed at least 44 people. The extreme temperatures are also affecting other countries in East Asia: South and North Korea have set heat records with temperatures climbing near 40 C (104 F). It is these types of heat waves that scientists have been warning would be a consequence of warming the planet through greenhouse gas emissions. The impacts of climate change are no longer subtle, said Michael Mann, a climate scientist and director of the Earth System Science Center at Penn State University. We are seeing them play out in real time in the form of unprecedented heat waves, floods, droughts and wildfires. And weve seen them all this summer, he said. Much of Europe has been baking under a massive high-pressure ridge that is allowing tropical heat to climb all the way to the Arctic and blocking cooling rainfalls from ending the stretch of hot weather. Temperatures above 32 C extended to the northern reaches of Scandinavia, setting records in Sweden, Finland and Norway for stations above the Arctic Circle. The result has been a string of unprecedented wildfires in Sweden that have prompted the country to request assistance from other nations such as Italy, with more resources to fight wildfires. The United Kingdom is off to its driest start to a summer, according to the Met Office, and it has been one of the hottest on record, coming in just 0.1 C behind the average temperature during the hottest summer on record in the UK, which averaged 21 C in 1976. The heat wave is ongoing, with a level three heat-health watch issued for much of south and east England through this week as temperatures will climb in to the 30s Celsius through Friday. In Northern Africas Sahara Desert, certainly no stranger to sweltering temperatures, a record high was recorded July 5 in Ouargla, Algeria. The mark of 51.3 C (124 F) is the highest temperature ever reliably recorded on the African continent, according to the World Meteorological Organization. This month, a brutal heat wave also struck Canada, which saw temperatures peak in Montreal on July 2 with a record of 36.6 C (98 F). There were at least 70 heat-related deaths across the province of Quebec; CNNs news partner CBC reported that the number of deaths overwhelmed Montreals morgue. In the United States, July heat waves have stretched from the highly populated Northeast to the desert Southwest. An exceptional stretch of heat in Dallas-Fort Worth has brought four consecutive days with record highs, hitting 108 or 109 F each day (42 to 43 C). July has seen 41 heat records set across the United States  but zero record minimums. This lopsided tally has become the norm, as climate change has tipped the scales so far in the direction of warmer temperatures. Cold and hot, wet and dry  we experience natural weather conditions all the time, said Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University. But today, climate change is loading the dice against us, making certain types of extremes, such as heat waves and heavy rain events, much more frequent and more intense than they used to be, Hayhoe said. Remember the series of brutal noreaster snowstorms that hit New England during a particularly cold stretch in late winter and early spring? The frequent bouts of snow and ice had many people wondering, what happened to global warming? Well, here it is. And this is what it looks like. Although it will still get cold during the winter and there will be colder-than-normal spells from time to time, the heat will return, and summers are getting hotter. 2018 is the hottest La Nina year on record (the cooling of the ocean waters in the Pacific during La Nina tends to cool the planet), according to the World Meteorological Association, and with La Nina fading away and El Nino (which warms the Pacific Ocean) likely to take its place, things are only going to get hotter.",23/07/2018,https://edition.cnn.com/2018/07/23/world/global-heatwaves-climate-change-wxc/index.html
Our climate plans are in pieces as killer summer shreds records,"Deadly fires have scorched swaths of the Northern Hemisphere this summer, from California to Arctic Sweden and down to Greece on the sunny Mediterranean. Drought in Europe has turned verdant land barren, while people in Japan and Korea are dying from record-breaking heat. Climate change is here and is affecting the entire globe  not just the polar bears or tiny islands vulnerable to rising sea levels  scientists say. It is on the doorsteps of everyday Americans, Europeans and Asians, and the best evidence shows it will get much worse. This summer, 119 people in Japan died in a heat wave, while 29 were killed in South Korea, officials there say. Ninety-one people in Greece died in wildfires, and ongoing fires in California have taken at least eight lives. Spain and Portugal sweltered through an exceptionally hot weekend with a heat wave that has killed three people in Spain and pushed temperatures toward record levels.. Deadly heat waves will become more frequent and occur in more places on the planet in coming decades, according to a study published last summer in the journal Nature Climate Change. Extreme heat waves are frequently cited as one of the most direct effects of man-made climate change. Remarkably, scientists can now work out in just a matter of days how much human-induced climate change has had to do with a particular weather event, using a combination of observation, historical data and current information from weather stations. The European heat wave was at least twice as likely to happen because of human intervention. Based on findings in Ireland it was double  and we know that with very high confidence  and based on data from all other weather stations it was more than double, said Karsten Haustein from the World Weather Attribution Project, part of Oxford Universitys Environmental Change Institute. Scientists have been able to use this kind of modeling for more than a decade, but improved technology now allows them to do it nearly in real time, letting people understand the links between what they are seeing and climate change. Despite the deadly summer, overwhelming evidence that humans are altering the planet, and ever-improving science that links specific weather events to global warming, the international politics around the issue of climate change are in disarray. And there are alarming signs that the planet may be in worse shape than ever before. A report released Wednesday by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) gave the Earth in 2017 a grim report card. The major greenhouse gases  carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide  all rose to record levels last year. The global average carbon dioxide concentration was the highest ever recorded, and higher than at any point in the past 800,000 years, according to ice-core data. Spending on oil and gas increased last year, pushing up the share of fossil fuels in energy supply investment for the first time since 2014, according to the International Energy Agency. Investment in renewable energy dropped 7%, while demand for coal rose, largely to keep Asias furnaces burning as the region rapidly develops. And last year also saw US President Donald Trump announce his plan to pull the US from the Paris Agreement, in a striking blow to global action on climate change. The US is the worlds second-biggest emitter of carbon dioxide, and a pact without the powerhouse nation is significantly weakened. The symptoms of climate change were also dramatic. Last year was the second or third-hottest year on record, depending on the dataset used, following three record-breaking hot years, the NOAA report showed. It was the hottest year on record without an El Nino, the natural weather event that adds to the warming of the seas and the whole planet. A new record for global sea levels was set. Unprecedented coral bleaching occurred, and both the Arctic and the Antarctic saw record-low levels of sea ice, as warmer air and seas continued the trend of thinning out the polar ice. The Earth has been getting steadily warmer since humans began using high levels of fossil fuels in the 18th to 19th centuries, during the Industrial Revolution. The planet has already warmed by around 1 degree Celsius since the late 19th century. More and more Americans are starting to accept climate change is happening, despite Trumps pledge to pull the US from the Paris Agreement. American acceptance of climate change returned to an all-time high of 71% in October last year after sliding significantly from around a decade ago, according to the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, which conducts quarterly surveys on attitudes to global warming. It has dropped to 70% this year so far. Some 58% of Americans believe that climate change is mostly man-made, a clear majority but a lower percentage than in most other developed nations. This understanding that climate change is at least happening has a lot to do with what people are seeing and experiencing, according to the Yale programs director, Anthony Leiserowitz. After the US was hit with several catastrophic hurricanes, the number of people who felt global warming was affecting US weather a lot leaped to 33% last October from 25% in May, five months earlier. That number went back down when winter came and extreme weather events subsided. People are increasingly connecting the dots when they see these weather events happening across the United States, Leiserowitz said. Its about the pattern  if an extreme event happens once or twice, its just a coincidence, but three, five, 12, 22 times, seeing record-setting events, seeing 1,000-year event after 1,000-year event happen frequently, people begin to see that larger pattern, that climate change is actually affecting the weather today. And thats a new concept for many Americans. This increase in awareness appears to be happening in Redding, California. The Carr Fire has torched more than 130,000 acres of land  the equivalent of nearly 100,000 football fields  and it became so big and hot this week, it created its own weather system. Firefighter Gabriel Lauderdale, 29, has lived all his life by the forest near Redding, and he says even thats enough time to have noticed the pattern and behavior of wildfires change dramatically. There seems to be more destructive wildfires and theyre happening more frequently, said Lauderdale. It used to be that a 10,000-acre fire was a large fire, and in these cases, were seeing many exceed 100,000 acres, and they reach that size relative quickly. They move into homes and businesses, and they move very fast from structure to structure. The Paris Agreement in 2015 was widely celebrated as an achievement, but it has major flaws  it is not legally binding, its unenforceable and soon it is likely to lack one of the worlds biggest polluters. The agreements predecessor, the Kyoto Protocol, was much stronger. It set ambitious and legally binding emissions reduction targets. But it too had its problems. It included only developed nations, so China, the worlds biggest carbon emitter, was not obliged to make reductions. This was always a sticking point for the US. George W. Bush in 2001 pulled his country out of the Kyoto agreement, which Congress had never ratified. Kyotos other major flaw was that although it was legally binding, no one was ever sanctioned for over-polluting. So the success of Paris lies in the fact that it at least engaged more than just developed nations. Those who ratify it make pledges to combat climate change as their countries see fit, and they are obliged to report on them transparently, in more of a name-and-shame system than one with mutually set goals. Another success of Paris is the recognition that the world should try to contain warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, or two degrees as a worst-case scenario. The agreement, however, did not include the legally binding goals to reduce carbon emissions that were sought by Europe but largely opposed by the US. Now the world is left with a watered-down agreement, and the country that pushed strongly for that dilution is no longer playing along. Todd Stern, the chief US negotiator in Paris, and the Obama administration are credited with bringing the US back into the fold after pulling out of Kyoto. But, Stern said, they knew they would never get binding targets past Congress, so they went into talks seeking an agreement that wouldnt need Congressional approval. Stern denies, however, that the US was the only one against binding targets, saying he would be stunned if all countries had agreed to get on board. He made clear his strong disapproval of Trumps announcement the day after it happened, and he has written op-ed after op-ed warning of the dangers of doing so. Its a completely mind-bogglingly, ill-informed and unwise decision for so many reasons, Stern told CNN, adding that the US was too big and influential to be left out. Trump has governed with his America First agenda at the forefront of his policy making and had argued that the Paris Agreement placed draconian financial burdens on the American people. I was elected by the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris, he said upon making his announcement in June last year. With the Paris Agreement being largely non-binding and with the US out of the deal, environmental groups are calling on the rest of the world to make stronger commitments. All other nations have to ditch incremental action for transformational change, said Claire Norman, speaking for Friends of the Earth in the UK. Other nations will need to step up  especially the UK, we used to be world-leading  and use every diplomatic and economic tool to compel the US to act.",04/08/2018,https://edition.cnn.com/2018/08/04/world/climate-change-deadly-summer-wxc-intl/index.html
We?e dangerously unprepared for the heat crisis from climate change,"Hot enough for you? Well, if you live in one of the many US cities where official heat emergencies have been declared, or if you live in California, suffering the worst wildfires in the states history, the answer is obvious. Extreme heat creates terrible conditions. And for many vulnerable individuals those conditions can be  and often are  deadly. Its not only the United States that is in a heat wave. Europe has been suffering this year, too; temperatures in Spain and Portugal have been approaching 115 degrees Fahrenheit this summer. We dont know the human cost of this heat wave yet, but a similar European heat wave in 2003 killed 70,000 people. Studies in American cities like Detroit, Phoenix, and New York suggest that most heat-related deaths occur among children and the elderly. In addition, people highly susceptible to heat-related complications include those with chronic health problems, especially respiratory problems. Poorer people are at higher risk than the more affluent because they are more likely to live in housing that is less resistant to extreme heat, insufficiently ventilated and often lacking air conditioning. The poorest neighborhoods also tend to have a relative lack of green space and generally more asphalt, factors that contribute to urban heat islands, where cities can be 2-10 degrees Fahrenheit hotter than surrounding suburbs or rural areas. Housing construction techniques and materials used can cause some homes to excessively absorb and retain heat. Recent reports from the United Kingdom indicate that some 1 of 5 homes in that nation, along with hospitals, nursing homes and similar institutions, are built mainly to insulate against cold, which means they retain heat and endanger occupants. The age of homes and construction techniques used decades ago can make matters worse for occupants during warm weather. A 2011 study of Detroit housing stock noted that construction methods in the early 20th century used insulation that causes heat and humidity to transfer indoors more easily, and that aging housing stock is more likely to be vulnerable to extreme heat. Poor ventilation, lack of air conditioning and use of heat absorbing materials in external surfaces of built structures are also more likely to be seen in older homes. So what do we need to know about staying safe during a heat emergency? First, people should be aware of an impending heat crisis via public announcements, along with advice designed to help prevent heat-related health complications. The location of neighborhood cooling centers should also be well publicized. Second, for older people and young children, living and sleeping spaces should have good ventilation. Air conditioning, central or individual units, is ideal, but sufficient availability of electrical fans can do the trick. Third, staying hydrated is essential. Plenty of liquids, especially those beverages that contain electrolytes  like sports beverages  are best. Fourth, people with illnesses that include fever as a symptom will dehydrate more quickly than others. Keep in mind that there are a number of diseases that can be exacerbated by intense heat and dehydration, including asthma and lung diseases that make breathing difficult even at moderate temperatures. Also at risk of dehydration are people with kidney disease or certain heart conditions. Seniors and infants are at higher risk, even if they dont have underlying medical conditions. Remember, too, that extreme heat can cause the condition known as heat stroke, and that can be lethal. Symptoms include very warm skin, elevated temperature, profuse sweating, rapid breathing and confusion. Heat stroke is life-threatening and requires a 911 call. While waiting for help, first aid should include cooling the victim, moving to a cooler place, and ice packs under the arms and on the groin. Most importantly, we need more definitive strategies that examine and address underlying causes of increasing frequency and intensity of heat crises. Obviously climate change and rapidly increasing global warming must be addressed  and soon. Fortunately, there are some important new initiatives being made to increase resilience to heat crises. Bloomberg Philanthropies, for instance, is funding a 10-year innovation plan in Phoenix, where suggested heat-mitigating measures include creating more green infrastructure. Trees should be viewed as critical infrastructure, the same as roads or water treatment facilities. Green infrastructure is also recommended by MIT, The Trust for Public Land, and the RAND Corp. because of relatively low financial and environmental costs for these measures in comparison to energy consuming solutions like air conditioning and major retrofitting of heat-absorbing homes. The Centers for Disease Control and Preventions five-step Building Resilience Against Climate Effects framework and the World Health Organization both consider climate change to be the No. 1 public health antagonist for the next century. These and many other international and national organizations recommend urgent steps to address global warming  the real culprit in an overheating planet that will continue to threaten the lives and well-being of millions of people across the world.",11/08/2018,https://edition.cnn.com/2018/08/11/opinions/cities-dangerously-overheating-climate-change-redlener-ratner/index.html
"Australia is devastated by drought, yet it won? budge on climate change","Australia is suffering its worst drought in living memory, as dozens of bushfires are blazing out of control. Its hard to believe that its winter down under. Summer is yet to come. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Sunday committed 1.8 billion Australian dollars ($1.3 billion) in relief funds for farmers, whose livelihoods are disappearing down the cracks of their dry, barren land. The very next day, he announced he was dropping a national policy to cut carbon emissions from the energy sector that was supposed to help Australia fulfill its obligations under the Paris climate change agreement. The vast majority of Australians accept human-induced climate change is real and scientists have linked the current record-slashing drought to global warming, yet the subject is still highly controversial in Australian politics, and climate change skepticism is still given political space. Turnbull is now facing a renewed leadership challenge from MP Peter Dutton. If Turnbull loses, he would be the third Australian prime minister to be ousted over climate policy in the past decade. A Dutton-led Australia would mean even less hope for those who want action on climate change. Peter Dutton: The immigration hardliner who could be Australias next PM Its difficult to comprehend why Australia  a wealthy, developed nation that has long experienced crippling weather events  has failed time and time again to get a coherent climate change plan together. All the signs are there. The UNESCO heritage-listed Great Barrier Reef, a 2,300-kilometer stretch rich in biodiverse marine life, is under threat, having lost more than half its coral in two mass bleaching events in 2016 and 2017. Australia clocked record heat in the first half of this year. The whole of New South Wales, the countrys most populous state, is now 100% in drought, with some areas seeing less than 10mm of rain in July, right in the middle of winter. Its so dry that animals are being forced to migrate  a group of emus recently swarmed the town of Broken Hill, running down the street and gate crashing football matches in search of water and food, the Australian ABC reported. Political wrangling is one reason for the slow progress. Turnbull scrapped his climate policy in order to ensure his survival as prime minister. The history of Australian politics is that climate policy has proven in the past to be so controversial that it has resulted in prime ministers losing their jobs, said Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute at the London School of Economics. Australians can see for themselves whats going on at the moment. Theyre facing a series of weather events linked to climate change  droughts, heatwaves, fires  and Australias scientific communities have been telling politicians for a long time whats going on. Instead of talking about global warming, the ruling Liberal Partys conservative faction, that has long resisted climate action, has framed the debate around electricity prices. Dutton said Tuesday that should he became leader he would set up an inquiry exploring why power was so pricey. A study published in the journal Nature Climate Change found that Australians who identify with the countrys conservative party are more likely to be predisposed to climate change skepticism. Of all 25 nations studied, only the United States had a stronger correlation between political ideology and belief in global warming. It also found that link between political leaning and climate change skepticism was typically present in countries with strong fossil fuel industries, including the US, Australia, Canada and Brazil, indicating the power of industry lobbying. Much of that lobbying happens through think tanks funded by the mining and energy industries, said John Cook, from the Center for Climate Change Communication at George Mason University. The broad picture in Australia is that in the 80s the issue was much less polarized. It was in the early 1990s that conservative think tanks began attacking climate science for ideological reasons, because the consequence of climate change meant regulating industry, Cook said. That combination of ideology and climate change skepticism is most apparent in former prime minister Tony Abbott, now a backbench MP but the most vocal critic of Turnbulls carbon reduction policy. Abbott pointed to the US President Donald Trumps announcement to withdraw the US from the Paris agreement as a reason for Australia to scrap its own emissions targets, saying last week, its time to get out of Paris. Abbott gave a speech to a climate-skeptic think tank in London last year, in which he made the remarkable claim that climate change was probably doing good, or at least, more good than harm, and likened climate change action to primitive people who killed goats to appease volcano gods. He has even called for new coal power stations to be built by the federal government. Turnbulls energy policy was aimed at bringing the country in line with its commitment to cut carbon emissions by 26% by 2030, from 2005 levels, as Australia pledged in the Paris climate change agreement. Australians support the agreement and climate change action more broadly  until it hits their wallets, polls show. A Newspoll survey published in The Australian newspaper in October 2017, for example, found almost half of those polled would support dropping out of the Paris climate change agreement if it lowered energy prices. (Climate action) has taken too long because of the political influence of the coal industry, and as a result ... a significant rump of the current government either dont believe in climate change or dont believe Australia should do anything, Ian Lowe, Emeritus Professor at Griffith Universitys School of Science, told CNN. Australia is regularly referred to at the worlds biggest coal exporter, and it depends heavily on the fossil fuel in its own energy mix, as well as for jobs and economic prosperity. Mining has contributed significantly to the countrys record-breaking 26 consecutive years of economic growth. Much of Australias coal is exported to China, to fuel the Asian powerhouses rapid development. But even China is starting to wean itself off dirty fossil fuel and is looking increasingly to renewable energy. Australia is getting a renewable energy program off the ground, but a lack of political will has meant progress has been incredibly slow, said Harald Heubaum, an energy and climate policy expert at the University of London. The huge potential in the sunny country for solar energy is still largely unrealized. So a question Australia could ask is, does it really just want to be a quarry for Asia? To take the coal and gas and iron ore, and whatever precious metals it can find and export them? Heubaum said. Or does it want to diversify away from that?",22/08/2018,https://edition.cnn.com/2018/08/22/australia/australia-climate-change-policy-intl/index.html
The climate crisis is making storms like Barry worse,"Extreme weather events are often pointed to as harbingers of what is to come, thanks to manmade climate change. Unfortunately, Tropical Storm Barry, like Hurricane Florence last year and Harvey the year before, looks like it will once again provide us with an example of what the climate crisis is doing to storms right now, with heavy rainfall from slow moving storms leading to devastating floods. Forecast projections for Barry show rainfall totals up to 20 inches could fall over portions of Louisiana. Barry hasnt hit yet, but its getting stronger as it creeps across the Gulf of Mexicos warm waters en route to a landfall expected early Saturday in Louisiana. While it could reach hurricane strength, the real peril it poses to roughly 10 million people in its path is rain, which could quickly trigger unprecedented flooding. Ten to 15 more inches of rain are on the way, threatening to inundate ground already soaked from a Wednesday storm that flooded some New Orleans homes and businesses. Another risk looms in the Mississippi River. Usually at 6 to 8 feet this time of year around the Big Easy, the river is at 16 feet after a year of record flooding, and Barry could push in a storm surge of 2 to 3 feet. The planet has warmed significantly over the past several decades, causing changes in the environment in which extreme weather events are occurring. Some are small and inconsequential, and some  such as increased wind shear that tears apart hurricanes, could actually be beneficial. But there can be destructive consequences. One of the impacts that scientists are most certain of is increased rainfall amounts and rainfall intensity  a result of warmer than normal ocean temperatures that create a warmer and more moist environment for the storm. Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said that climate change leads to these warmer and wetter environments and sets the stage for what can be the storms biggest threat: heavy rainfall and flash flooding. We saw it in Florence and Harvey and it appears we may see it again with Barry. Sea surface temperatures in the northern Gulf of Mexico, where Barry formed and is currently strengthening, are around 87-90 degrees Fahrenheit (30-32 degrees Celsius). These temperatures are about 2-4 degrees Fahrenheit (about 1-2.5 degrees Celsius) above average for July. Human-caused greenhouse gases in the atmosphere create an energy imbalance, with more than 90% of remaining heat trapped by the gases going into the oceans, according to the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Association. Ocean heat content, a measure of the amount of heat stored in the upper levels of the ocean, is a key indicator of global warming. Last year was the hottest on record for the Earths oceans, with a record high for global heat content in the upper 2,000 meters of the oceans, which broke the record from the year before. The heat fuels storms of all sorts and contributes to very heavy rain events and flooding, Trenberth said. The observed increases of upper (ocean heat content) support higher sea surface temperatures and atmospheric moisture, and fuel tropical storms to become more intense, bigger and longer-lasting, thereby increasing their potential for damage. Warmer oceans mean more moisture is available in a warmer atmosphere. Its one of the simplest relationships in all of meteorology, said Michael Mann, professor of atmospheric science and director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University. For every 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degree Fahrenheit), there is 7% more moisture in the air. Ocean temperatures around Florence trended 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) warmer than normal, contributing to about 10% more moisture available in the atmosphere. This certainly helped make Florence the wettest tropical system to strike the US East Coast, dumping almost 3 feet of rain on parts of North Carolina. Florence brought the tides to record levels in portions of North Carolina last September despite having weakened to a Category 1 storm, with peak winds of 90 mph. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations tide gauge at Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina, surged more than 4 feet above the normal high as the storm was making landfall, breaking a record set by Hurricane Joaquin in 2015 by more than a foot. Flooding in Beaufort and Wilmington, North Carolina, also topped high-water marks that go back decades. Several factors combined to make Florence such a prolific coastal flood threat. Its large size, slow movement and previous Category 4 intensity all helped pile up a huge amount of water. But those characteristics are mainly a product of the day-to-day weather patterns around Florence and are somewhat random  a roll of the weather dice, if you will. One important threat enhancer is that ocean levels along the East Coast have risen by nearly a foot in the past century, thanks primarily to global ocean warming. The added height of the ocean is a reality faced every day by coastal residents, even when storms are not present, such as with sunny-day floods in Miami and the Outer Banks of North Carolina. But when a storm such as Florence or Barry comes ashore, the destruction is even worse than it would have been decades ago  one reason why Category 1 hurricanes such as Matthew and Florence produced higher water levels on the North Carolina coast than did 1954s Hurricane Hazel, a Category 3 storm when it made landfall in the same region. Florence, Harvey and now Barry should not be treated as an example of what human-fueled global warming could bring us at some point in the future. They are unfortunate examples of what global warming, caused by ever-increasing greenhouse gas emissions, is doing to storms in the present day. Better coastal infrastructure and flood defenses, along with an immediate reduction in greenhouse emissions, can help minimize the future threat. President Donald Trump got a close-up view of the damage when he toured the hardest-hit areas of the Carolinas last year, just as he did in Houston with Hurricane Harvey in 2017. The visit once again provided the President with evidence that climate change is already affecting the country.",19/09/2018,https://edition.cnn.com/2018/09/19/us/climate-change-hurricane-florence-wxc/index.html
"To truly fight climate change, we need to set our sights higher","The catastrophic recent weather events in the United States, Asia and elsewhere have once again shown that the world is in the midst of a climate crisis of our own making. While countries like ours are on the front lines of the worst impacts to come, these events remind us that no country is immune. Simply put, the commitments the world has made so far under the Paris Agreement to reduce the emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases are woefully inadequate. And we are out of time. If we do not increase these commitments by 2020 as the agreement requires us to do, the potential impacts will be devastating, and they threaten the lives, homes and livelihoods of people in countries like ours. We must act, and we must make the world understand its responsibility to act. That is why, together, Fiji and the Marshall Islands, as members of the High Ambition Coalition, which came together in the Paris negotiations, are committed to continuing to lead the world by example. At this years UN General Assembly, we were among the first to announce that we will deliver stronger new targets to reduce emissions, and have, or are in the process of developing, long-term decarbonization plans. Last Monday, the Marshall Islands published one of the most ambitious plans to decarbonize an economy, pledging to reach net-zero emissions by midcentury, and to implement short-term plans consistent with that long-term vision. This makes sense for our economy and our environment, as well as for our people and our planet. We will do this by transforming our electricity, waste and transportation sectors, and putting a big new focus on adaptation, for which we will be heavily reliant on securing additional international public finance. Similarly, Fiji is committing to delivering an enhanced emissions-reduction target by next year. To achieve this, we are engaging all sectors of the economy to prepare a comprehensive long-term 2050 decarbonization strategy to achieve net-zero emissions. This process will inform the preparation of our new national target. We are examining extra reductions from our transport, maritime, agriculture and forestry sectors. This is in addition to our existing commitment to produce 100% of our electricity from renewables by 2030. But governments alone cannot combat climate change. The enormity of the challenge defies simple government solutions. It will take conscious effort at every level  in every community, every business, every institution and every home. It will, indeed, require all of us, working toward one noble, and ultimately self-interested, objective to preserve the quality of life as we know it on planet Earth. We are pleased to see that many sub-national governments  the worlds cities, counties, states, and regions  are taking up the mantle of leadership, and in some cases are ahead of their national governments in their efforts and their stated commitments. Climate action and leadership, wherever it arises, needs to be embraced. That is why we are encouraged that the vast majority of the private sector and civil society is energetically embracing the need to reduce carbon emissions and waste of all kinds. This kind of commitment should serve to strengthen the resolve and the ability of governments to raise their own targets. There is a robust process in place to do so  through the UN Convention on Climate Change. This years meeting in Poland in December will be marked by the Talanoa Dialogue, based on the concept of an open, honest and respectful process of dialogue used in the Pacific. The idea of Talanoa is to bring the best ideas for how to tackle this threat to the surface and share them. We need this process of collective effort now more than ever. The nations of the world will need to bring solutions  in the form of strengthened targets and long-term decarbonization plans by 2020. That is the deadline agreed to in Paris to increase our short-term actions in order to keep temperatures within the safe limits established by that very agreement. To achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, we need to chart a clear path forward. This path goes from the groundswell of climate action we witnessed at California Gov. Jerry Browns Global Climate Action Summit last month, through Climate Week and the One Planet Summit in New York last week, through to the Virtual Summit of the Climate Vulnerable Forum in November, to the Talanoa Dialogue at COP24, and from there into 2019 and the UN Secretary-Generals Climate Summit. This is the path forward, and if we all walk it together, we can reach our destination. Fiji and the Marshall Islands are leading by example. We are moving forward and we call on all other countries to follow our lead. We believe that if two developing countries can develop robust emissions-reduction targets that truly drive us toward the goals we agreed to in Paris, then other nations can, too  including the almost 30 countries that signed a Declaration for Ambition in June, and which we call on other countries to now join. When we talk about combating climate change, we always talk about the need to raise ambition. That is what we have done. Every country must now join us.",03/10/2018,https://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/03/opinions/climate-change-marshall-islands-fiji-bainimarama-heine/index.html
"Planet has only until 2030 to stem catastrophic climate change, experts warn","Governments around the world must take rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society to avoid disastrous levels of global warming, says a stark new report from the global scientific authority on climate change. The report issued Monday by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), says the planet will reach the crucial threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels by as early as 2030, precipitating the risk of extreme drought, wildfires, floods and food shortages for hundreds of millions of people. The date, which falls well within the lifetime of many people alive today, is based on current levels of greenhouse gas emissions. The planet is already two-thirds of the way there, with global temperatures having warmed about 1 degree C. Avoiding going even higher will require significant action in the next few years. This is concerning because we know there are so many more problems if we exceed 1.5 degrees C global warming, including more heatwaves and hot summers, greater sea level rise, and, for many parts of the world, worse droughts and rainfall extremes, Andrew King, a lecturer in climate science at the University of Melbourne, said in a statement. Global net emissions of carbon dioxide would need to fall by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 and reach net zero around 2050 in order to keep the warming around 1.5 degrees C. Lowering emissions to this degree, while technically possible, would require widespread changes in energy, industry, buildings, transportation and cities, the report says. The window on keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees C is closing rapidly and the current emissions pledges made by signatories to the Paris Agreement do not add up to us achieving that goal, added King. The report makes it clear that climate change is already happening  and what comes next could be even worse, unless urgent international political action is taken. One of the key messages that comes out very strongly from this report is that we are already seeing the consequences of 1 degree C of global warming through more extreme weather, rising sea levels and diminishing Arctic sea ice, among other changes, said Panmao Zhai, co-chair of IPCC Working Group I. Even if warming is kept at or just below 1.5 degrees C, the impacts will be widespread and significant. Temperatures during summer heatwaves, such as those just experienced across Europe this summer, can be expected to increase by 3 degrees C says the report. More frequent or intense droughts, such as the one that nearly ran the taps dry in Cape Town, South Africa, as well as more frequent extreme rainfall events such as hurricanes Harvey and Florence in the United States, are also pointed to as expectations as we reach the warming threshold. Coral reefs will also be drastically affected, with between 70 and 90% expected to die off, including Australias Great Barrier Reef. Countries in the southern hemisphere will be among the worse off, the report said, projected to experience the largest impacts on economic growth due to climate change should global warming increase. The report underlines how even the smallest increase in the base target would worsen the impact of recent natural disasters. Every extra bit of warming matters, especially since warming of 1.5 degrees C or higher increases the risk associated with long-lasting or irreversible changes, such as the loss of some ecosystems, said Hans-Otto Portner, Co-Chair of IPCC Working Group II. The report cites specific examples of how impacts of global warming would be lessened with the 1.5 degrees C increase, compared to the 2 degrees C increase: Special Report: What its like at the ground zero of climate change Mondays report is three years in the making and is a direct result of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. In the Paris accord, 197 countries agreed to the goal of holding global temperatures well below 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees C. The United States was initially in the agreement, but President Donald Trump pulled the country out a year and half later, claiming it was unfair to the country. To limit global warming to 1.5 degree C is possible within the laws of chemistry and physics, said Jim Skea, co-chair of IPCC Working Group III. But doing so would require unprecedented changes. International cooperation is absolutely imperative to limit emissions and therefore global warming and its impacts, as well as coordinating effective and widespread adaptation and mitigation, said Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick, a fellow at the Climate Change Research Center at the University of New South Wales. The next few years will be critical in the evolution of these efforts. One key issue will be negative emissions, large scale carbon-scrubbing technologies that can reduce the amount in the atmosphere and act to counter continued pollution. According to the report, there are two main ways of removing carbon from the atmosphere: increasing natural processes that already do this, and experimental carbon storage or removal technologies. However, all methods are at different stages of development and some are more conceptual than others, as they have not been tested at scale, the report warned. They will also require considerable political engagement globally, as will reducing the amount of carbon being emitted. Despite the reports dire warnings, there is no indication such cooperation will be doable, particularly given the Trump administrations stance on this issue. Today the worlds leading scientific experts collectively reinforced what mother nature has made clear  that we need to undergo an urgent and rapid transformation to a global clean energy economy, former US Vice President Al Gore said. Unfortunately, the Trump administration has become a rogue outlier in its shortsighted attempt to prop up the dirty fossil fuel industries of the past. The administration is in direct conflict with American businesses, states, cities and citizens leading the transformation.",08/10/2018,https://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/07/world/climate-change-new-ipcc-report-wxc/index.html
UN climate change report contrasts with recent EPA policy changes,"A report from the international scientific authority on climate change warning consequences could be drastic if rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes are not made to mitigate global warming contrasts starkly with Trump administration policies decreasing federal regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. The report, released Monday, evaluates what consequences the world will face if global temperatures increase by 1.5 or 2 degrees Celsius  2.7 or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit  as part of a directive to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change when the Paris Climate Accord was adopted in 2015. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the agreement in June 2017, keeping a campaign promise. To prevent global warming from passing 1.5 degrees Celsius, emissions would need to decline rapidly across all of societys main sectors, such as industry, energy and agriculture, the report says. Global net emissions of carbon dioxide would need to fall by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 and reach net zero around 2050 to keep the warming around that level. Instead of bolstering policies that strictly limit greenhouse gas emissions, recent policy changes from the Trump administration relax those restrictions. The UN panels report names a number of ways countries can reduce emissions, including phasing out coal in the energy sector, increasing the amount of energy produced from renewable sources and electrifying transport. We appreciate the hard work of the scientists and experts, many from the United States, who developed this report under considerable time pressure, EPA spokesman John Konkus said in a statement to CNN. In accordance with IPCC procedures, the report and its contents remain the responsibility of its authors. Governments do not formally endorse specific findings presented by the authors. Konkus noted that US greenhouse gas emissions have fallen by 12% since 2005. Scientists working on the report said the world is already starting to see the impact of global warming by 1 degree Celsius and warned that if countries dont intervene to hold the warming at only 1.5 degrees Celsius  instead of allowing it to reach 2 degrees Celsius  some of the damage could be irreparable. Every extra bit of warming matters, especially since warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius or higher increases the risk associated with long-lasting or irreversible changes, such as the loss of some ecosystems, Hans-Otto Portner, a co-chair of the panels Working Group II, one of the groups that compiled the report, said in a news release. When asked what policies the EPA has implemented to reduce emissions, Konkus said that every action EPA takes is directed to improve human health and the environment. He noted that the EPA continues to implement the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule Update, a regulation that addresses interstate transport of ozone pollution during summer months in the Eastern United States. Under the rule update finalized in 2016 during the Obama administration, 2017 ozone season nitrogen oxide emissions were 21% below 2016 levels. In the first half of 2018, there has been a 4% reduction in nitrogen oxide compared with the first half of 2017, according to Konkus.",08/10/2018,https://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/08/politics/un-climate-change-report-epa-us-policy-global-warming/index.html
These companies are leading the fight against climate change,"The world has only until 2030 to stem catastrophic climate change. Can global companies be part of the solution? A report published Monday by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said that rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society are needed to avoid disastrous levels of global warming. While often seen as culprits, some businesses are setting a positive example. The companies with the best track records tend to be consumer brands, according to reports from corporate transparency advocate CDP, public opinion consultancy GlobeScan and think tank SustainAbility. Unilever (UL) is the global corporate leader in environmental sustainability, according to a survey of experts conducted by GlobeScan and SustainAbility. The owner of brands including Ben & Jerrys and Dove will ensure that all of its agricultural materials come from sustainable sources by 2020. It says it will do so by working with farmers to reduce environmental harm. It has also agreed to eliminate single use plastic packaging in the United Kingdom, where possible, by 2025. The consumer goods giant wants to become carbon positive by 2030. That means it will eliminate the use of fossil fuels, and support the generation of more renewable energy than it consumes. They created a very strategic plan that still is in many ways the best in class. They created these ambitious, clear plans that focus on what they really need to do  on packaging, chemical production, food production, said Chris Coulter, co-CEO of GlobeScan. Unilever has found itself under pressure over plastic. Earlier this year, the company was named by the Break Free From Plastic campaign as one of the firms most responsible for plastic pollution in India, the Philippines and Indonesia. Unilever has acknowledged it must go much further, much faster, in addressing the challenge of plastic waste. The outdoor apparel company is big on the environment. Founded by surfers and rock climbers in California, Patagonia makes clothes using organic cotton and recycled fabrics, including polyester, nylon and wool. The company has made headlines with its Dont buy this jacket campaign, which was meant to discourage customers from purchasing too many Patagonia products. Patagonia pledges 1% of sales to the preservation and restoration of the natural environment. Its also a certified B Corporation, meaning its legally required to consider the impact of decisions on its workers, customers, suppliers, community and the environment. The mega food producer has stepped up efforts to police its supply chain after criticism of its use of palm oil, which is often produced on land previously covered by forests. Nestle (NSRGF) has committed to using 100% responsibly sourced palm oil by 2020, and to blacklist companies that do not comply with its policies. It will use satellite technology to ensure no deforestation is taking place in its supply chain. At the scale they are, the largest food company on the planet, they have been able to manage some of those issues and be part of the solution, said Coulter. The Swedish retailer has invested 1.7 billion ($2 billion) into renewable energy projects. It plans to build 416 wind turbines and has already installed around 750,000 solar panels on Ikea buildings. Ikea has also said it will ban single-use plastic products from its shops and restaurants by 2020. The company wants to purchase 100% renewable energy by 2020, and use only renewable and recycled materials in its products by the same year. It plans to make its home deliveries emissions free by 2025. Tesla (TSLA) says its mission is to accelerate the worlds transition to sustainable energy. The electric-car maker has a code of conduct for suppliers, which includes a pledge to work to avoid harm to the environment, responsible management of all waste and efficient use of water and energy resources. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Tuesday on Twitter that the UN climate reports findings are a reminder of why its important to accelerate advent of cars powered by electricity made from solar power. Unlike other companies praised for helping the planet, Tesla doesnt disclose many details of its environmental practices. No one really knows about Tesla and its strategy, because it is so opaque, said Coulter. But its a company with a purpose to disrupt the fossil fuel industry  it gets the points.",09/10/2018,https://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/09/business/climate-change-companies/index.html
How climate change will affect your health,"Climate change might bring an increase in disease-carrying mosquitoes and ticksContaminated water sources can spread dangerous bacterial infections A new report from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns of dire consequences if governments dont make rapid, far-reaching, and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society to stem global warming. But the planet isnt the only thing at risk as temperatures rise; your health might be in danger, too. Here are six ways that climate change might affect you, whether its insect-borne disease or Type 2 diabetes. Hot and humid climates provide a perfect breeding ground for critters, and experts say that a warming world might put us at greater risk for vector-borne diseases, which are those transmitted by ticks, mosquitoes or other organisms. In a 2017 report, the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health warned that mosquitoes that carry diseases like West Nile virus and dengue fever thrive in conditions that are becoming more common, and there is concern that malaria could reemerge in the United States. Environmental changes affect not just the distribution of insects like mosquitoes but also how quickly viruses replicate within them and how long the bugs live. All of that might have contributed to recent Zika virus outbreaks, according to the CDC. More than 2,400 pregnant women in the United States have tested positive for Zika since 2015, and the United States has seen a rise in Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever and other vector-borne diseases. Only 27,388 such cases were reported in 2004, but that number jumped to 96,075 in 2016, according to a CDC report. Extreme weather and rainfall have contributed to the spread of bacterial infections through contaminated water, especially in summer. Warmer temperatures will only make those storms worse. Dr. Mona Sarfaty, director of the program on climate and health at George Mason Universitys Center for Climate Change Communication, said that when increased rainfall leads to flooding, there can be a mixing of stormwater and sewage that leads to bacterial contamination in the water. That contamination can affect crops too, contributing to foodborne diseases. Heavy downpours and flooding can spread fecal bacteria and viruses into fields where food is growing, said a report from the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health. Warmer ocean water also makes a difference, Sarfaty said. Along the coast, there are cases of bacterial contamination in shellfish in the warmer months that make those waters more likely to cause infection when people swim there, especially if they have open cuts in their skin. Even a modest rise in temperatures is associated with an increase in mental health issues, according to a study published this year that surveyed nearly 2 million US residents. The research, in the journal PNAS, looked at individual cities and found that warming of just 1 degree over five years was linked to a 2% increase in mental health issues. Using a different approach, the study also found that an increase in average monthly temperatures to over 30 degrees Celsius (86 Fahrenheit), up from an average of 25 to 30, was correlated with a 0.5% increase in mental health issues. That might seem like a small change, but Nick Obradovich, the studys lead author and a scientist at MITs Media Lab, noted that those results, if consistent across the country, would produce approximately 2 million additional individuals reporting mental health difficulties. Those challenges can turn deadly. A study published this year in the journal Nature Climate Change found that a rise of 1 degree Celsius in monthly temperatures correlated with a 0.68% increase in the United States suicide rate. Using that data, researchers estimate that climate change could be linked to over 14,000 suicides by 2050. Though more research is needed to determine what exactly causes that increase in suicide, the studys lead author said economic factors or biological changes might be to blame. As economic conditions worsen, that might also worsen mental health, said Marshall Burke, an assistant professor in the Department of Earth System Science at Stanford University. There also might be a plausible biological linkage between temperature, thermal regulation and how the brain regulates its own emotion. Rising temperatures are associated with an increase in Type 2 diabetes, according to a 2017 study published in the journal BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care. However, researchers looked only at the correlation between temperatures and diabetes, so the study didnt establish that temperatures necessarily caused the disease. Still, researchers found that diabetes rates increased by about 4% for every 1 degree Celsius of warming in the United States. Worldwide, glucose intolerance rose by 0.17% per degree Celsius of warming. Lead study author Lisanne Blauw, a researcher at Leiden University Medical Center in the Netherlands, said that a 1-degree Celsius rise in environmental temperature could account for more than 100,000 new diabetes cases per year in the USA alone. Although calorie consumption and obesity are likely to be the biggest risk factors for diabetes, the study hypothesizes that warmer temperatures might decrease the activity of brown fat tissue, which burns fat and generates heat in colder weather. In warmer climates, brown fat may be less activated, Blauw said, which may causally lead to insulin resistance and diabetes. Most scientists agree that greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide are contributing to global warming, but those emissions arent just hurting the planet. Fossil fuel pollutants can also generate a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets in the atmosphere that can enter your lungs and even your bloodstream. That mixture, called particulate matter, can aggravate asthma, decrease lung function and increase your risk of cardiovascular events such as strokes, according to a study published last year in The Lancet. That same study estimated that over 8 million people die early due to air pollution every year. A warming planet also means more wildfires, which routinely release smoke that further worsens air quality. A 2011 report from the National Research Council found that a warming of just 1 degree Celsius could lead to a 400% increase in the area of land burned by wildfires. But its not just smoke and pollutants youre inhaling; its pollen, too. Increases in carbon dioxide can trigger plants to produce more pollen, which might explain why the pollen season seems to get worse each year. A 2012 study presented at the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology conference estimated that pollen counts were expected to reach 21,735 grains per cubic meter in 2040. In 2000, that number was just 8,455. Even small changes in climate can impact human behavior, leading to an increase in fatal car accidents and a decrease in food safety inspections, according to a study published this year in PNAS. Researchers analyzed data from more than 70 million police stops, more than 500,000 motor vehicle accidents and nearly 13 million food safety violations. They found that above 29 degrees Celsius (84 Fahrenheit), police conduct fewer traffic stops, which can contribute to unsafe driving conditions. A 10-degree Celsius increase in maximum temperatures decreased traffic stops by 1.5%, according to the study, and that same temperature change amplified the risk of a fatal car crash by half a percentage point. The researchers also found that health officials were less likely to conduct food safety inspections when temperatures exceeded 26 Celsius (79 Fahrenheit). Across the 750,000 restaurants and food production facilities they studied, they found that a 10-degree increase in temperatures translated to 8,000 fewer inspections per day. When those facilities were inspected, though, hotter temperatures led to more violations, probably because pathogens like E. coli and salmonella grow faster in warmer weather. Obradovich, the MIT Media Lab research scientist who co-authored the study, noted that hot temperatures are basically bad for human functioning. The crux of the idea, he said, was that weather affects how we perform our duties and how we go about our daily lives and the risks that we experience.",12/10/2018,https://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/12/health/climate-change-health-effects/index.html
Climate change endangers dozens of World Heritage sites,"Dozens of World Heritage sites are endangered by climate changeBy the year 2011 flood risk may rise by 50%, study finds Pull out your passport and pack your bags for the sunny Mediterranean. But hurry. Youve got a lot of traveling to do if youre going to see some of the historical wonders of the world before climate change further damages them, according to a study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications. Across the Mediterranean region, flood risk may increase by 50% and erosion risk by 13% by the year 2100, the study found, with considerably higher increases at specific World Heritage sites, areas chosen to be preserved due to their importance in human history. The impact on those historical icons would be significant, the study warned, unless actions are taken quickly. Adaptation planning is urgently needed, said lead author Lena Reimann, a doctoral researcher for the Coastal Risks and Sea-Level Rise Research Group in Germany. If our common heritage is destroyed or lost, it is not possible to replace or rebuild it. There are 1,092 cultural historical sites on the 2018 World Heritage List, which, according to the authors, have high intangible value as they represent icons of human civilization. Because our ancestors often settled near water for both food and commerce, a good many are in coastal areas, especially in the historically rich Mediterranean region. Due to the steep topography of many of the sites clustered along the Mediterranean Sea, most cities, then and now, were built at the waters edge. Many of those World Heritage sites are already at risk from rising sea levels. Venice, for example, has been thought to be sinking for years. In reality, Venice floods regularly, and has done so for centuries. In 1996 a combination of rain, high tides and high wind caused the canals to rise a devastating 6 feet above normal levels. Thats today. But little is known about the potential future effects of the flooding and erosion climate change may bring, and that was what this study was designed to address. The researchers ranked and compared 49 locations facing the highest risk from a total of 159 World Heritage sites lining the Mediterranean Sea. Due to the sheer numbers of historical sites along their coasts, a third of those endangered sites were located in just four countries: Italy (15), Croatia (7), Greece (4) and Tunisia (4). The studys design explored the risk of flooding and erosion under four different sea-level rise scenarios until 2100, ranging from no risk to highest risk. Flooding risk was highest for cities along the northern Adriatic Sea. Some are in severe danger now. Besides Venice and its lagoon, the Italian city of Ferrara and its wetlands of Po Delta and the Patriarchal Basilica of Aquileia at the northern coast of Italy are currently at high risk due to rising sea levels. To determine future flood risk, the researchers combined flood area and flood depth; they found the flood risk index under the worst-case scenario to increase by up to 50 % until 2100 across the region. The maximum flood depth, they found, may rise by 290% across the region. In Venice, maximum flood depth may be as high as 2.5 meters or 8 feet above normal levels. The study also looked at the cost of erosion by flood waters and found 42 of the 49 sites were suffering coastal erosion today. Italy contains the most number of sites endangered by erosion, followed by Croatia and Greece. By 2100, under the highest risk scenario, the Lebanese city of Tyre topped the list of cities endangered by erosion. Tyre is home to one of the largest, well-preserved Roman hippodromes, racecourses used mostly for Roman chariot races. Tyre was followed by Ephesus, Greece, known for the nearby Temple of Artemis, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. In equal danger are Heraion, a large temple dedicated to Hera in Samos, Greece, and the Archaeological Ensemble of Tarraco in Spain, said to be the first and oldest Roman settlement on the Iberian Peninsula. Only two of the 49 sites, the Medina of Tunis and Xanthos-Letoon, appear to be safe from climate change-related flooding and erosion by the end of the century, the study found. Grim findings, perhaps, but Reimann and her colleagues hope the information in their report can help galvanize action to protect these unique historical sites from further damage. If rigorous climate change mitigation is pursued as planned under the Paris Agreement, said Reimann, future increases in flood risk and erosion risk could be kept to a minimum. While the World Heritage Coalition monitors each historical site, its up to each country to maintain their sites, which includes adaptation to climate change. However, said Reimann, adaptation will be especially challenging in countries with a large number of World Heritage Sites at risk such as Italy, Croatia and Greece. Some of those countries also face other concerns, Reimann said, such as the economic crisis, refugees issues and social conflict which might interfere with the countrys ability to address the challenges climate change may bring. In these instances, hopefully the UNESCO World Heritage Convention might be able to support the affected countries, Reimann said.",16/10/2018,https://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/16/world/climate-change-world-heritage-sites/index.html
Change your diet to combat climate change in 2019,"The production of animal products generates the majority of food-related greenhouse-gas emissions Sustaining a healthier planet will require a shift toward more plant-based diets, experts say You may be aware that a plant-based diet can make you healthier by lowering your risk for obesity, heart disease and Type 2 diabetes. But research shows theres another good reason to regularly eat meatless meals. By filling your plate with plant foods instead of animal foods, you can help save the planet. One study, published in October in the journal Nature, found that as a result of population growth and the continued consumption of Western diets high in red meats and processed foods, the environmental pressures of the food system could increase by up to 90% by 2050, exceeding key planetary boundaries that define a safe operating space for humanity beyond which Earths vital ecosystems could become unstable, according to study author Marco Springmann of the Oxford Martin Programme on the Future of Food at the University of Oxford. It could lead to dangerous levels of climate change with higher occurrences of extreme weather events, affect the regulatory function of forest ecosystems and biodiversity ... and pollute water bodies such that it would lead to more oxygen-depleted dead zones in oceans, Springmann said. If the whole world, which continues to grow, eats more like us, the impacts are staggering, and the planet simply cant withstand it, said Sharon Palmer, a registered dietitian nutritionist and plant-based food and sustainability expert in Los Angeles who was not involved in the new research. Sustaining a healthier planet will require halving the amount of food loss and waste, and improving farming practices and technologies. But it will also require a shift toward more plant-based diets, according to Springmann. As Palmer noted, research consistently shows that drastically reducing animal food intake and mostly eating plant foods is one of the most powerful things you can do to reduce your impact on the planet over your lifetime, in terms of energy required, land used, greenhouse gas emissions, water used and pollutants produced. It might come as a surprise, but Springmanns study found that the production of animal products generates the majority of food-related greenhouse-gas emissions  specifically, up to 78% of total agricultural emissions. This, he explained, is due to manure-related emissions, to their low feed-conversion efficiencies (meaning cows and other animals are not efficient in converting what they eat into body weight) and to enteric fermentation in ruminants, a process that takes place in a cows stomach when it digests food that leads to methane emissions. The feed-related impacts of animal products also contribute to freshwater use and pressures on cropland, as well as nitrogen and phosphorus application, which over time could lead to dead zones in oceans, low-oxygen areas where few organisms can survive, according to Springmann. For an example of how animal foods compare with plant-based foods in terms of environmental effects, consider that beef is more than 100 times as emissions-intensive as legumes, Springmann said. This is because a cow needs, on average, 10 kilograms of feed, often from grains, to grow 1 kilogram of body weight, and that feed will have required water, land and fertilizer inputs to grow. In addition, cows emit the potent greenhouse gas methane during digestion, which makes cows and other ruminants such as sheep especially high-emitting. Other animal foods have lower impacts because they dont produce methane in their stomachs and require less feed than cows, Springmann explained. For example, cows emit about 10 times more greenhouse gases per kilogram of meat than pigs and chickens, which themselves emit about 10 times more than legumes. Like animals, plants also require inputs from the environment in order to grow, but the magnitude is significantly less, Springmann explained. In todays agricultural system, we grow plants to feed animals, which require all of those resources and inputs: land, water, fossil fuels, pesticides, herbicides and fertilizer to grow. And then we feed plants to animals and care for them over their lifetime, while they produce methane and manure, Palmer said. Adopting more plant-based diets for ourselves could reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of the food system by more than half, according to the Nature study. A mainly plant-based diet could also reduce other environmental impacts, such as those from fertilizers, and save up to quarter use of both farmland and fresh water, according to Springmann. Palmer explained that legumes [or pulses], such as beans, lentils and peas are the most sustainable protein source on the planet. They require very small amounts of water to grow, they can grow in harsh, dry climates, they grow in poor nations, providing food security, and they act like a natural fertilizer, capturing nitrogen from the air and fixing it in the soil. Thus, there is less need for synthetic fertilizers. These are the types of protein sources we need to rely upon more often. Experts agree that if you are not ready to give up meat entirely, a flexitarian diet, which is predominantly plant-based, can help. This diet includes plenty of fruits, vegetables and plant-based protein sources including legumes, soybeans and nuts, along with modest amounts of poultry, fish, milk and eggs, and small amounts of red meat. Vegetarian and vegan diets would result in even lower greenhouse gas emissions, but a flexitarian diet is the least stringent that is both healthy and would reduce greenhouse gas emissions enough for us to stay within environmental limits, according to Springmann. Palmer said that although vegan diets, followed by vegetarian diets, are linked with the lowest environmental impacts, not everyone is interested in taking on those lifestyles. But everyone can eat more of a flexitarian diet. It doesnt mean that you have to give up meat completely, but you significantly reduce your intake of it. Registered dietitian nutritionist Dawn Jackson Blatner described it this way: A flexitarian is really someone who wakes up with the intention of being more vegetarian. Its different from vegetarian in that there is some flexibility. Just how flexitarian you wish to be can be flexible, too. For example, Blatner, who was not involved in the Nature study, offers three levels of the diet in her book The Flexitarian Diet: a beginner flexitarian, who consumes six to eight meatless meals per week (or is limited to 26 ounces of animal protein); an advanced flexitarian, who eats nine to 14 meatless meals per week (or is limited to 18 ounces of animal protein); and an expert flexitarian, who eats at least 15 meatless meals or limits animal protein to 9 ounces per week. The key is not just eliminating meat but swapping in plant-based proteins, including beans and lentils. A Mediterranean meal might incorporate chickpeas; a Mexican meal might have black beans or pintos; an Asian meal might include edamame; an Italian meal might use white beans or lentils to make a Bolognese pasta sauce, Blatner explained. I wrote the book because I really wanted to be a vegetarian, but I just couldnt do it so strictly, she said. I really wanted to lean in to a more plant-based diet, but I needed a little more flexibility. So its the great compromise. To get started on a flexitarian diet, heres a sample three-day plan, courtesy of Blatner. Youll notice that some meals have a choice of a plant-based protein or an animal-based protein. Choose plant as often as you can, and youll soon be an expert-level flexitarian of 15-plus meatless meals per week.

How states can fight climate change under Trump,"Twenty-two years: thats how long we have before the current pace of climate change will cause irreversible destruction to the environment we depend on for food, water and breathable air, according to a recently published landmark United Nations scientific panel report. The sobering analysis  conducted by 91 scientists from 40 countries  found that the threshold for a temperature increase that would cause such destruction is 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, not the previously estimated 3.6 degrees. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is aggressively turning back the clock on policies meant to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Their fast-paced deregulation is the equivalent of playing Russian roulette with nature, and we humans are likely to be the losers. It was concerning enough that the United States pulled out of the Paris Agreement last year, showing a dangerous disregard for the overwhelming evidence that greenhouse gas emissions need to be reduced. But the hurtful rollbacks did not stop there. Just recently the Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to combine the Office of the Science Advisor with its research arm  a move that threatens to further diminish the role of science in informing environmental policy. In August, the EPA drafted rules that would weaken fuel efficiency and carbon dioxide emissions standards for vehicles. And in September, the agency released a proposal relaxing the requirements for oil and gas companies to monitor and repair methane leaks. Here is what is so alarming. Until now, nature has done a pretty astounding job of absorbing the greenhouse gases that we have been pouring into our atmosphere over the last 150 years. But a growing body of research shows that we may well be running out of miracles. Recently, my colleagues and I at the Advanced Science Research Center at The Graduate Center of The City University of New York published evidence showing that increased precipitation brought on by climate change is making forest soil wetter and reducing its ability to absorb methane from the atmosphere. Additional studies show that global warming and other man-made environmental changes are causing natural sources of methane trapped beneath lake sediments, wetlands, and Arctic permafrost to be released into the atmosphere. Clearly, we have reached the point where it is no longer simply an issue of exhausting natures capacity to absorb our pollution. Now we must grapple with the knowledge that our continued emissions will spur a cause-and-effect loop that will accelerate the rate of climate change. The urgent recognition of natures limitations to offset our damage to the planet should motivate policymakers to increase regulations on greenhouse gas emissions, not roll them back. This perilous backtracking is happening despite the fast-growing effects of climate change. Worldwide, our weather events are more intense and destructive, our seasons are less predictable, and the threats to our communities, property and food supplies are growing. Fortunately, many states seem determined to force the federal government to live up to its responsibilities. For example, 17 states and the District of Columbia are suing the federal government over its decision to peel back stricter vehicle emissions standards. But the work of our state and local governments has to go much deeper if we are going to stay the effects of climate change. Given our federal leaders determination to ignore this crisis, its time for states, cities and municipalities to partner with local university researchers to create robust plans that address the holistic aims of climate health and the needs of residents. By focusing their efforts on emission-reduction goals with relatively simple solutions, states can realize significant environmental and economic benefits. A recent analysis commissioned by the Environmental Defense Fund, for example, suggests cost-effective ways for state and local governments to reduce emissions of methane from natural gas extraction and transport by using currently available technologies and operating practices. Such practices reduce the environmental impact of these activities and save companies money by reducing loss of valuable methane. We already have examples of how some states are moving aggressively toward this type of simple, yet effective environmental stewardship. California legislators recently voted to require that 100 percent of the states electricity come from carbon-free sources by 2045. And New York decided to leave the methane that could be extracted using new hydraulic fracturing techniques in the ground while also pledging to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent by 2030. It is important to note that these states are largely focusing their efforts on reducing waste and improving efficiency  actions that are relatively easy and economical. These efforts, which include reducing leaks from methane extraction and curbing vehicle emissions, are inherently local or site-specific activities. The examples set by states like California and New York highlight the potential power of state and local governments to make a positive difference in the face of a federal administration that refuses to do so. Science is showing us that we have exhausted natures miracles. Now its time for humans to take responsibility and action.",25/10/2018,https://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/25/opinions/how-states-can-fight-climate-change-groffman/index.html
Can this carbon capture technology save us from climate change?,"Its a stark prognosis: To save the world from the worst effects of climate change, its likely not enough to cut carbon dioxide emissions; we need to start scrubbing carbon pollution from the atmosphere, too. And not just a little bit of carbon. Vast amounts of it. The problem is, the jury is still out on whether thats even possible. Last month, a report from the global authority on climate science, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), warned of the catastrophic consequences likely to result if humans cause global temperatures to rise more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The group also said that if we want to stay below the 1.5 degree limit, well need to use technologies that remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air. But the report noted that carbon removal at the scale thats likely required is unproven and reliance on such technology is a major risk in the ability to limit warming to 1.5C. In other words, dont solely bank on an unproven technology when your future is on the line. Just how much CO2 we need to pull from the air depends on how much of that heat-trapping gas we keep pumping into the atmosphere. If we fail to make dramatic cuts  which is how things stand with current global emissions pledges  by the end of the century we might need to remove a total of around 30 times the CO2 that the world currently emits each year, according to the IPCC report. There are many methods we might use to remove CO2 from the air, from the low-tech  simply planting more trees  to the speculative  adding iron to the oceans to speed the uptake of atmospheric CO2 by microscopic plant life. Read: Worlds oceans have absorbed 60% more heat than previously thought But one method thats got a lot of attention from IPCC scientists is known as Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage, or BECCS. Essentially, it means growing bioenergy crops and then burning them at power stations to create energy, while capturing the CO2 thats emitted. When the bioenergy crops grow, they absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. As long as the CO2 captured when they are burned is safely stored, the process is considered carbon negative. Of course, its not quite that simple. Growing, collecting, transporting and processing the crops will have a carbon footprint, but advocates believe that if the process is well managed, BECCS can be an important tool in removing atmospheric CO2. Along with tree planting, BECCS is the CO2 removal method most used by the IPCC in its scenarios for limiting global warming. Niall MacDowell, who leads the Clean Fossil and Bioenergy Research Group at Imperial College, London, says: BECCS tends to come out as the preferred technology in many of the scenarios because in addition to removing CO2 from the atmosphere, it also generates power and is therefore a more cost-effective way to deliver these negative emissions. Inevitably, BECCS has its drawbacks. As well as the difficulties in ensuring the bioenergy is carbon neutral, there is the problem of carbon capture. There are very few examples of carbon capture and storage at large-scale power generating facilities that have come in on cost and work as expected, says Glen Peters, research director at the Center for International Climate Research, in Norway. Large-scale is the key adjective here for carbon capture, but even more so for bioenergy. Read: Why US oil companies may regret betting against renewable energy In some emission scenarios, a land area bigger than India would be needed to grow the required bioenergy crops. That land might otherwise be used for forestry or to produce the food needed by a growing global population. Then theres the question of how much water is needed, and how much carbon is released by converting land for growing bioenergy crops. But MacDowell has studied the potential for BECCS to be rolled out at scale and believes it is possible, in theory at least. My research indicates it can work but you have to be very careful to do it the right way, he says. If one were not careful to astutely manage and optimize the entire supply chain, starting from land thats used for production of biomass right the way across the supply chain to harvesting and processing and final conversion to an energy product and effective sequestration of the CO2, then it might not work. But on top of the land needed to grow the crops, there is the land needed to store the CO2 indefinitely, and the infrastructure needed to move the CO2 there. So is BECCS a dead end? A dangerous distraction from the crucial business of cutting emissions? Some argue exactly that. Others see huge potential. There are some small BECCS projects already running, but this month, a facility in the north of England is set to become the first power station in the world to start piloting the technology. Drax power station provides about 6% of the UK power supply. When it opened in the 1970s it burned only coal but these days, four of its six generators are powered solely by biomass. It claims that by using sustainably sourced biomass from managed forests in the United States, it saves at least 80% of the CO2 it would have emitted by burning coal (the missing 20% is down to supply chain emissions). Read: What its like at the ground zero of climate change Remember, burning biomass still emits CO2 (actually, slightly more than coal, per unit of energy produced), but if Drax can capture that and either reuse or store it, then in theory, the process becomes carbon negative. Power generation that actually removes atmospheric CO2. Drax is working with a local company called C-Capture, which has developed a chemical to trap the CO2 from its biomass flue gases. The technology has been tested in the lab and the plan is to trial it at the power station. If Drax were to scale up the technology, Drax Power CEO Andy Koss says a pipeline could be built to deliver the CO2 to disused North Sea oil or gas fields or aquifers, for long-term sequestration. If other power stations and heavy industries in the region were to also implement carbon capture, Koss says they could hook up to the same pipeline, driving down costs. But experts say that at the moment theres little economic incentive for large BECCS projects, and that governments should be providing more support. Koss sees scope for some large-scale BECCS deployment around the world, but acknowledges there are limits to the amount of sustainable biomass that can be produced. If BECCS has a role to play in carbon removal, it will need to be alongside other methods. Read: What tiny Bhutan can teach the world about being carbon negative The least helpful thing we can do at the moment is get captured by some sort of hype cycle where we get overly excited by one technology, says MacDowell. When it comes to fighting climate change, experts say the priority must still be to reduce emissions immediately. Peters warns of the dangers of us cutting emissions too slowly, in the hope that an unproven technology will one day make up for our inaction. The IPCC scenarios (for reducing emissions) are based on the assumption that we have large-scale negative emissions, he says. The risk there is that were choosing a pathway today that depends on us having this technology in the future  if we dont have this technology, future generations will pay the consequences.",09/11/2018,https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/09/health/bioenergy-carbon-capture-climate/index.html
"No G20 countries are meeting climate targets, says report","None of the countries that make up the G20 group of major world economies is on course to adequately reduce climate change, with 82% of the blocs energy supply still coming from fossil fuels, a new report has warned. Of the countries, only India has set targets that would keep global temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius, the upper limit recommended by the Paris Climate Agreement, if adopted globally. Overall, the world is heading for a 3.2-degree rise, the organization Climate Transparency said, in an analysis of the G20s current emissions-cutting targets for 2030 published Wednesday. Targets set by the worst offenders  Russia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey  would lead to a rise of more than 4 degrees if they were adopted worldwide, the report added. The G20 comprises representatives from Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The landmark Paris Agreement, drafted in 2015, resulted in an aim to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial levels, with 2 degrees set as an upper limit. But the report cautions that those targets are virtually impossible to reach at current rates. It follows similar warnings made last month by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which found that the earth will reach the crucial 1.5 degree threshold as early as 2030. The G20 economies actually need to cut their emissions by half by 2030 to keep warming below 1.5C, said Jan Burck, senior adviser at equality NGO Germanwatch, one of the reports authors. Germanwatch is one of 14 partners that make up Climate Transparency. But instead of responding to the urgency of climate change, the G20 countries continue to pour money into factors that drive climate disruption, like fossil fuel subsidies, instead of taking stronger action, he added. G20 countries account for around 80% of the worlds global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the World Resources Institute. Several experts involved with the report criticized the G20s continued reliance on fossil fuels. Its in the G20s own economic interests to shift from brown to green energy, but were still seeing major investment into the fossil fuel industry, along with huge subsidies, said Charlene Watson of the Overseas Development Institute (ODI). Fossil fuel subsidies from G20 nations totaled $444 billion a year, according to a 2015 study by the ODI. Individual nations were also singled out by the report, with Britain and France praised for commitments to phase out fossil fuel vehicles, but several others countries were criticized for setting insufficient goals. Australia, Canada, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and the United States lack ambitious renewable energy targets and policies, said Niklas Hohne co-founder of the NewClimate Institute, who co-authored the report. Deforestation was also highlighted, with the report noting rapid forest loss in Brazil, Argentina and Indonesia and warning that of those countries, none show any signs of reversing this trend. Brazils newly-elected far-right President Jair Bolsonaro has promised to open up tracts of the Amazon rainforest to development, prompting an outcry from environmental groups. We hope our new President will keep Brazil in the leadership of climate negotiations and increase climate action within the country, said William Wills, research coordinator at Brazilian organization Clima, which contributed to the report. This years G20 summit will take place in Argentina from November 30.",14/11/2018,https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/14/europe/g20-climate-targets-fossil-fuel-report-intl/index.html
3 things businesses can do to win the climate change fight,"The sobering report issued by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change last month was a public jolt. The report found that the Earths temperature will warm by 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by as soon as 2030, sparking some devastating consequences. Like it or not, if we are going to make any progress on climate change, we are going to have to look to the business world. There are roughly 100 companies directly responsible for CO2 emissions, outlined in the Carbon Majors report. Others in the utility and transportation sectors are indirectly responsible for carbon emissions. The good news is that more business leaders are recognizing that climate change is indeed a real threat, and many are leading the way in making it a priority in business decisions. Heres how businesses can tackle climate change head-on: Some boardrooms have begun to build climate risks into their assumptions and business plans. For some businesses, it means making changes in their own supply chains that reduce CO2 emissions. Walmart, for instance, has pledged to reduce a gigaton of CO2 from its supply chain. For other companies, it means shifting their own energy needs away from fossil fuels to renewable energy. Google and Facebook are good examples of this. They have both committed to buying 100% of their energy needs from renewable sources. Many large multinational corporations now allocate resources to either mitigate damage or exposure from climate risks or to adapt to changing environments. Theyre doing so largely because they want regulatory certainty, as well as a level playing field as governments begin to restrict carbon emissions in the next 20 years. More than a dozen industry sector leaders  including General Motors, MetLife, Exelon, AT&T, Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, PepsiCo, Unilever, Shell, BP and Total  have agreed to support the proposed Climate Leadership Councils Baker-Shultz carbon dividends plan in the past year. This plan would set a national carbon price at $40 a ton in the first year, and it would rise each year after that. The revenue from the carbon fee would be returned to US families as a dividend. The business community as a whole can and should support this prospoal. Renewables now disrupt our biggest energy markets and industries such as transportation and utilities. Distributed-grid technologies offer homeowners and small businesses options to generate power for zero fuel costs. Vast new economies of scale drive down prices, making clean energy easier, cheaper and available to all. For businesses, utilities should offer solar and wind options and have solar rooftops integrated into the electric grid. The cost of building solar plants is now as cheap as building a coal plant. Corporations are realizing that shifting to more efficient, environmentally friendly renewable energy can be important to bottom lines. Pepsi and Coca-Cola have both chosen to address climate impacts affecting their supply chain. Two of the largest packaged food companies, Kellogg and General Mills, have environmental and climate data programs that map out risks and energy efficiency goals throughout their global supply chains. The programs embrace renewables as a way to find and improve efficiencies and reduce energy costs. But will such changes happen fast enough to stave off the worst impacts already occurring? Renewable energy needs to replace traditional energy as quickly as possible, and electric vehicles need to replace the internal combustion engine in the next 10 to 15 years. Those are big, seemingly impossible benchmarks. Consumers should demand this. But the next move could be revolutionary. Climate change has created the single greatest wealth opportunity in history. The free-market forge is poised to refine a $90 trillion thing of beauty and wonder by using a carbon price signal sufficient to engineer a low-carbon energy economy. Will Americas business leaders choose to grab this hammer and aim it at the anvil to remake the world before its too late  especially if tens of millions of technology-savvy consumers actively support that change for all our best interests on this shared planet?",15/11/2018,https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/15/perspectives/un-climate-change-report-businesses/index.html
"Climate change will shrink US economy and kill thousands, government report warns","A new US government report delivers a dire warning about climate change and its devastating impacts, saying the economy could lose hundreds of billions of dollars  or, in the worst-case scenario, more than 10% of its GDP  by the end of the century. The federally mandated study was supposed to come out in December but was released by the Trump administration on Friday, at a time when many Americans are on a long holiday weekend, distracted by family and shopping. David Easterling, director of the Technical Support Unit at the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, emphasized that there was no external interference in the reports development. He added that the climate change the Earth is experiencing is unlike any other. The global average temperature is much higher and is rising more rapidly than anything modern civilization has experienced, and this warming trend can only be explained by human activities, Easterling said. Coming from the US Global Change Research Program, a team of 13 federal agencies, the Fourth National Climate Assessment was put together with the help of 1,000 people, including 300 leading scientists, roughly half from outside the government. Its the second of two volumes. The first, released in November 2017, concluded that there is no convincing alternative explanation for the changing climate other than human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases. The reports findings run counter to President Donald Trumps consistent message that climate change is a hoax. On Wednesday, Trump tweeted, Whatever happened to Global Warming? as some Americans faced the coldest Thanksgiving in over a century. But the science explained in these and other federal government reports is clear: Climate change is not disproved by the extreme weather of one day or a week; its demonstrated by long-term trends. Humans are living with the warmest temperatures in modern history. Even if the best-case scenario were to happen and greenhouse gas emissions were to drop to nothing, the world is on track to warm 1.1 degrees Fahrenheit. As of now, not a single G20 country is meeting climate targets, research shows. Without significant reductions in greenhouse emissions, the annual average global temperature could increase 9 degrees Fahrenheit (5 Celsius) or more by the end of this century, compared with preindustrial temperatures, the report says. The costs of climate change could reach hundreds of billions of dollars annually, according to the report. The Southeast alone will probably lose over a half a billion labor hours by 2100 due to extreme heat. Farmers will face extremely tough times. The quality and quantity of their crops will decline across the country due to higher temperatures, drought and flooding. In parts of the Midwest, farms will be able to produce less than 75% of the corn they produce today, and the southern part of the region could lose more than 25% of its soybean yield. Heat stress could cause average dairy production to fall between 0.60% and 1.35% over the next 12 years  having already cost the industry $1.2 billion from heat stress in 2010. When it comes to shellfish there will be a $230 million loss by the end of the century due to ocean acidification, which is already killing off shellfish and corals. Red tides, or algae bloom that deplete oxygen in the water and can kill sea life  like those that triggered a state of emergency in Florida in August  will become more frequent. Higher temperatures will also kill more people, the report says. The Midwest alone, which is predicted to have the largest increase in extreme temperature, will see an additional 2,000 premature deaths per year by 2090. There will be more mosquito- and tickborne diseases like Zika, dengue and chikungunya. West Nile cases are expected to more than double by 2050 due to increasing temperatures. Expect asthma and allergies to be worse due to climate change. No ones health is immune from climate change, the report concludes. People will be exposed to more foodborne and waterborne diseases. Particularly vulnerable to higher temperatures in the summer, children, the elderly, the poor and communities of color will be at a much greater risk for illness and death. Wildfire seasons  already longer and more destructive than before  could burn up to six times more forest area annually by 2050 in parts of the United States. Burned areas in Southwestern California alone could double by 2050. Dependable and safe water for the Hawaii, the Caribbean and others are threatened by these rising temperatures. Along the US coasts, public infrastructure and $1 trillion in national wealth held in real estate are threatened by rising sea levels, flooding and storm surges. Energy systems will be taxed, meaning more blackouts and power failures, and the potential loss in some sectors could reach hundreds of billions of dollars per year by the end of the century, the report said. The number of days over 100 degrees Fahrenheit will multiply; Chicago, where these days are rare, could start to resemble Phoenix or Las Vegas, with up to two months worth of these scorching-hot days. Sea levels have already gone up 7 to 8 inches since 1900. Almost half that rise has been since 1993, a rate of rise greater than during any century in the past 2,800 years. Some countries are already seeing land underwater. By midcentury, its likely that the Arctic will lose all sea ice in late summer, and that could lead to more permafrost thaw, according to the report. As the permafrost thaws, more carbon dioxide and methane would be released, amplifying human-induced warming, possibly significantly. The report was created to inform policy-makers and makes no specific recommendations on how to remedy the problem. However, it suggests that if the United States immediately reduced its fossil fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions, it could save thousands of lives and generate billions of dollars in benefits for the country. The Defense Department is trying to understand what risk climate change poses to security. But the Trump administration has signaled that the country will pull out of international initiatives like the Paris climate accord, aimed at lowering global temperatures, claiming that these treaties have been unfair for the US economy. A report from the UN in October urged all governments to take rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society to avoid disaster from climate change. That report predicted that the Earth will reach the crucial threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels by as early as 2030. It also suggested the world faces a risk of extreme drought, wildfires, floods and food shortages for hundreds of millions of people. Reactions to the new report have been strong across the scientific community. If were going to run this country like a business, its time to address climate as the threat multiplier we know it is before more lives are lost, said Robert Bullard, an environmental scientist at Texas Southern University. In Houston, communities of color have endured back to back major weather events without the acknowledgment from Washington that climate change is the cause. Weve known for years that its true and its important to our organizing and our local policy efforts that information like this is not only considered, but believed and acted upon. Scientists who have been raising the alarm about the negative consequences of climate change for years welcomed the findings. The findings in the Trump administrations NCA report show how the health and daily lives of Americans are becoming more and more interrupted because of climate change, said Beverly Wright, founding director of the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice and a professor at Dillard University. We challenge the administration to finally begin using this information to rebuild and strengthen the communities in the direct path of the atrocities wrought by the fossil fuel industry and decades of poor policies that have neglected our concerns. The science is undeniable, lets fix it.",23/11/2018,https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/23/health/climate-change-report-bn/index.html
15 takeaways from the US climate change report,"The average global temperature is much higher and rising more rapidly than anything modern civilization has experienced, according to David Easterling, one of the authors of a new US government report that delivers a dire warning about our future. Thousands more could die, food will be scarcer, and the US economy could lose hundreds of billions of dollars  or, in the worst-case scenario, more than 10% of its GDP  by the end of the century. Released Friday, the Fourth National Climate Assessment was put together with the help of 1,000 people, including 300 leading scientists, roughly half from outside the government. It comes from the US Global Change Research Program, a team of 13 federal agencies, and is the second of two volumes. The first, released in November 2017, concluded that there is no convincing alternative explanation for the changing climate other than human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases. The report breaks down the possible impact of climate change by US region and looks at the effects climate change will have on health, economy and infrastructure. Here are some of its key predictions: Farmers will face extremely tough times. The quality and quantity of crops will decline across the United States due to higher temperatures, drought and flooding. In parts of the Midwest, farms will be able to produce only about 75% of the corn they produce today, and the southern part of the region could lose more than 25% of its soybeans. By 2100, higher temperatures in places like Yolo County, California, could make it too hot to cultivate walnuts. Climate change could also severely limit almond production in California. Heat stress, which cost the dairy industry $1.2 billion in 2010, will become an even bigger issue, potentially causing average dairy production to fall between 0.60% and 1.35% over the next 12 years. Livestock for meat could struggle to find plants to graze on, and heat stress could impact their numbers. There wont be as many oysters, shrimp or crab due to ocean acidification. The report predicts a $230 million loss for that industry by the end of the century. Annual oyster harvests in the Southeast will decline by 46% under the worst-case scenario by the end of the century. Fish stocks overall may decline as red tides  algae bloom that deplete oxygen in the water and can kill sea life  become more common. It was a red tide that triggered a state of emergency in Florida in August. The coral reefs that support diverse fish life off the Florida Keys are already declining and could be lost in the coming decades due to higher temperatures. River fish could also die off; higher temperatures have already led to die-offs due to proliferative kidney disease. Warmer temperatures were a problem for endangered sockeye salmon and Chinook in the Columbia River when they suffered a serious die-off in 2015. Weather that is bad for farmers is good for spreading food- and waterborne diseases, and more people will be exposed to them. Marine toxins and pathogens will contaminate seafood. The waterborne bacteria Vibrio, which is already causing thousands of illnesses a year, will expand to seafood in northern seas and affect oysters grown in the Northeast. Floods and heavy rains that can cause sewers to overflow can contaminate drinking water, leading to more stomach problems, studies have shown. Droughts could cause more skin and eye infections, due to lack of water for personal hygiene. Other waterborne diseases that could spread include hepatitis A, salmonellosis, shigellosis, typhoid and E. coli. Weather thats bad for crops is good for bugs. Mosquitoes and ticks love warmer and wetter temperatures. That means diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika will be more widespread. West Nile cases are expected to more than double by 2050 due to increasing temperatures. The Northeast could see more cases of Lyme disease as the tick season expands in states like Maine and Pennsylvania. Asthma and allergies will also be worse due to climate change. The pollen season will intensify and lengthen in parts of the United States due to warmer temperatures. Oak pollen in the Midwest will send more people to the emergency room for asthma, costing up to $170,000 annually, according to the report. Urban areas with higher concentrations of CO2 will see more allergy-causing plants such as ragweed growing faster. Increased rain in some areas will encourage mold growth indoors, which can make asthma symptoms worse. Extreme weather can have serious mental health consequences and lead to post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression. Exposure to extreme heat, for instance, is associated with aggressive behavior, suicide, violence and higher admissions to hospitals for people who have a mental illness, studies have shown. Extreme temperatures can also increase stress levels. Worsening air quality limits the time people can exercise or socialize outside; both activities are big stress relievers, studies have shown. Higher temperatures will also kill more people, the report says. The Midwest alone, which is predicted to have the largest increase in extreme temperatures, will see an additional 2,000 premature deaths per year by 2090. People who live in Rhode Island could see an additional 1,500 heat-related ER visits by 2095, and some of those visits will end in death, according to the report. Poor air quality can also lead to more strokes and heart attacks. The heat will be a problem for elderly people with chronic conditions, increasing the death rate by 2.8% to 4% with each increase of approximately 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) in summer temperature. The Southeast alone will probably lose 570 million labor hours by 2090. In the worst-case scenario for farm workers, by the end of the century, high temperatures will add up to a loss of 2 billion labor hours, equating to an estimated $160 billion in 2015 dollars. In Chicago, it will be a lot harder to work outside when 100-degree days, rare now, become increasingly common. By late century, the report predicts that the city could see almost 60 days a year over 100, making it more like present-day Phoenix or Las Vegas. Infrastructure is vulnerable to increasing temperatures and wet seasons. By 2050, the Southeast will have the most vulnerable bridges at risk of failure, and more dams will probably break with increased hurricanes and rain. The East Coast now has 7,508 miles of roadways threatened by high tide coastal flooding, and that problem will only get worse with climate change. Train systems like Atlantas MARTA could fail in extreme rains. MARTA authorities are trying to identify what parts of the system are most vulnerable to climate change and are trying to make improvements before problems start. Storm water systems werent built to withstand the extreme rain that comes with climate change. The cost of adapting urban storm water systems in the Midwest, for example, could exceed $480 million per year. The total cost to remediate sanitation facility deficiencies to provide safe water and sewers for American Indians in the Northern Great Plains could be around $280 million. These populations are already vulnerable to climate change. For example, Standing Rock ran out of water during a 2003 drought. Charleston is trying to shore things up because it is predicted to have 180 tidal floods per year by 2045, compared with 11 it had in 2014. Each flood event costs the city $12.4 million (in 2009 dollars), studies show. Other Southeast coastal cities like Wilmington, North Carolina, and Miami and Key West, Florida, have set records for coastal flooding in recent years. High tide flooding poses daily risks to homes, businesses and infrastructure. Sea level rise and storm surge in the Southeast could cost the region up to $60 billion each year by 2050 and up to $99 billion by 2090 under the worst-case scenario. More than half a million people in Florida face extreme or high risk from sea level rise. Wildfire seasons  already longer and more destructive than ever  could burn up to six times more forest area annually by 2050 in parts of the US. Burned areas in Southwest California could double by 2050. Firefighting costs in the Southwest alone could total $13 billion from 2006 to 2099. Sea level rise will ultimately wipe out the record of human habitation of the coastal margin in the Southeast within the next one or two centuries, a study has shown. The Southeast would lose 13,000 recorded historic and prehistoric archeological sites due to projected sea level rise. More than 1,000 sites on the National Registry of Historic Places are endangered, including forts in Charleston, South Carolina; St. Augustine, Florida; and Savannah, Georgia. The predicted freeze-free season will probably lengthen by more than a month in the Southeast. That means a variety of tree-damaging beetles will probably move north and kill trees there. In the West, bark beetle infestations could spread; they killed 7% of western US forest area from 1979 to 2012 due to warming temperatures, the report says. In South Florida, the Burmese python will like the warmer temperatures and reproduce more, potentially decimating mammal populations. Rodents that carry disease could also reproduce faster. Invading Humboldt squid that love deoxygenated water, warmed and acidified by climate change, will prey on fish stocks in the West.",26/11/2018,https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/26/health/climate-change-report-15-takeaways/index.html
Americans are worried about climate change,"The new government report on climate change, which the Trump administration released quietly a day after Thanksgiving and two days after President Donald Trump tweeted skeptically about the existence of climate change, warns that the drastic human effects on the climate could cause thousands of Americans to die and cost the US economy hundreds of billions of dollars. But even before the report was made public, Americans were extremely worried about climate change. Almost two-thirds (64%) of voters said the US needs to be doing more to address climate change, according to a poll by Quinnipiac University in August, up from 57% who said the same in December 2015. This opinion is divided by party lines: 91% of Democrats said more should be done, and 67% of independents agreed. Fewer Republicans (one third) said more should be done about climate change, and another third of Republicans thought that the US is doing enough to address climate change. In the December 2015 Quinnipiac poll, 83% of Democrats thought the US should be doing more, compared to 62% of independents and 26% of Republicans. The Trump administration chose to speed up release of the new report, which is required by law, putting it out on Black Friday instead of in December. It also came two days after Trump issued another tweet transmitting his skepticism of the existence of Climate change. Brutal and Extended Cold Blast could shatter ALL RECORDS - Whatever happened to Global Warming? he said Wednesday on Twitter. An earlier portion of the climate change report was released in November 2017 and found no convincing alternative explanation for the changing climate other than human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases. A CBS news poll from April of this year found a majority of Americans (54%) thought climate change was caused by mostly human activity (such as burning fossil fuels) rather than the quarter who said its caused by mostly natural patterns. The number who said its impacted more by human activity is up from only 46% who said so in February 2014. Trump has stood by his years-old claim that climate change is a hoax and emphasized that belief with his statements about the California wildfires, which he said were a result of poor forest management, drawing criticism from firefighters, climate scientists and many others. The government report, which is called the National Climate Assessment, addressed wildfires, reporting that one impact of climate change will be longer and more destructive wildfires, that could burn up to six times more forest annually by 2050 in parts of the US. Californias wildfires are the worst in the states history. Over half (53%) of voters in the August Quinnipiac poll said climate change is a factor in making fires more extreme. At that point, the fires in California were only beginning, and some are still burning in November, so its unclear whether that number has changed since August. Eight-in-10 Democrats, 54% of independents, and 22% of Republicans thought in August that climate change has an impact the fires. Another impact of climate change will be on the health of Americans, whether because of extreme heat and higher temperatures, diseases (like Zika) that come from mosquitoes and ticks, more food and waterborne diseases, or higher risk of asthma and allergies. Concern about climate change and global warming has gone up in the last few years  from 33% who said they worry a great deal about it in March 2013 to 43% who say the same now, according to Gallup. Around the same number (45%) said they think global warming will pose a serious threat to them or their way of life in their lifetimes in the March poll. Thats up from 2010, when Gallup first asked it and only a third of Americans thought global warming would impact them. Democrats are much more likely to think theyll be impacted (67%) than independents (45%) or Republicans (18%), but whether thats because more Democrats live in coastal regions or due to just plain partisanship, its hard to tell. In a statement by White House deputy press secretary Lindsey Walters, the Trump administration downplayed the report, saying it is largely based on the most extreme scenario, which contradicts long-established trends by assuming that despite strong economic growth that would increase greenhouse gas emissions, there would be limited technology and innovation, and a rapidly expanding population.",26/11/2018,https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/26/politics/climate-change-poll-report/index.html
Here? how climate change will impact the US,"The lengthy National Climate Assessment released on Friday includes detailed information about how specific regions of the US will be impacted. Heres what else you need to know.  There will be shorter winters and longer summers.  There will be a decline of species that support some of the most valuable and iconic fisheries, including Atlantic cod, Atlantic sea scallops and American lobsters.  Expect approximately 650 excess deaths per year caused by extreme heat by 2050  Health risks from contaminated flood waters. For example, because much of the historical development of industry and commerce in New England occurred along rivers, canals, coasts, and other bodies of water, these areas often have a higher density of contaminated sites, waste management facilities, and petroleum storage facilities that are potentially vulnerable to flooding.  61% of major cities are exhibiting some aspects of worsening heat waves, which is a higher percentage than any other region of the country.  Experts project the region will see the greatest increase in cases of West Nile neuroinvasive disease.  More people will die: Absent mitigation, an additional 200 to 550 premature deaths in the region per year by 2050. These account for almost half of the total projected deaths due to the climate-related increase in ground-level ozone nationwide and may cost an estimated $4.7 billion (in 2015 dollars). But under another scenario, by 2090, 2,000 additional premature deaths per year, compared to the base period of 1989-2000, are projected due to heat alone without adaptation efforts. Northern Great Plains  Food supply will suffer from declining crop yields and increasing pest problems: The area is home to nearly a quarter of US agriculture. Report cites increasing temperatures that lead to yield declines and increase the range and fecundity of crop pests. Southern Great Plains  Variety of health threats come from rising temperatures: Increasing heat illness and diseases transmitted through food, water and insects will increase as temperature rises. Heat illness and stress is connected to a number of conditions, including lung disease, and increases the death rate for elders with chronic conditions.  More wildfires: The increased temperatures have intensified droughts in California and the Southwest region. Recent wildfires have made California ecosystems and Southwest forests net carbon emitters, meaning they emit more carbon into the atmosphere than they use. With increased greenhouse gas emissions, the report predicts that more wildfires will occur across the region. Under higher emissions, fire frequency could increase by 25% and the frequency of larger fires could triple, the report states.  Sea level rise: The report estimates that sea level rise and storm surge could completely erode two-thirds of southern California beaches by 2100. Ocean waters have been warming. Off the coast of California and worldwide, ocean temps warmed by 0.6 to 0.8 degrees Fahrenheit from 1971 to 2010, mainly due to climate change. Continued climate change effects could warm California waters by between 4 to 7 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100, according to the report.  Increased temperatures caused by greenhouse gas emissions are projected to cause winter warming throughout the region, which could impact not only the environment but the economy of different states in the region. Warming will also impact fish populations that live in this region, which also would have a severe economic impact. Warmer winters in the region will lead to a reduction in the mountain snowpack, which will increase wildfire risk. Comparing high snowfall years to low snowfall years in the region between 1999 and 2009, each low snowfall year resulted in more than 2,100 fewer employees and $173 million reduction in ski resort revenues, according to the report.  Ocean/water warming: Increasing ocean temperatures and acidity impact fish survival, the report states. As water temperatures continue to rise, negative impacts on fisheries are expected to increase. With increased stream temperature projections, the report predicts a 22% reduction in salmon habitat in Washington by the end of the century if emissions continue to release at a higher rate. That kind of salmon population loss would correlate to a $3 billion economic loss.  Islands could shrink: Puerto Rico and the USVI are projected to lose 3.6% and 4.6% of total coastal land area, respectively. Were such a rise to take place, Puerto Ricos critical infrastructure near the coast would be negatively impacted, including drinking water pipelines and pump stations, sanitary pipelines and pump stations, one wastewater treatment plant, and six power plants and associated substations.  The state is warming faster than any other state and twice as fast as the global average since the middle of the 20th century.  Devastating impact to fishing industry: Alaskan fisheries are among the most productive and valuable in the world. A recent heat wave in the Gulf of Alaska, which led to an inability of the fishery to harvest the Pacific cod quota in 2016 and 2017 and to an approximately 80% reduction in the allowable quota in 2018.  Flooding would be devastating, especially on low-lying islands: ... Across the state, nearly 550 Hawaiian cultural sites would be flooded or eroded, 38 miles of major roads would be chronically flooded, and more than 6,500 structures and 25,800 acres of land located near the shoreline would be unusable or lost, resulting in approximately 20,000 displaced residents in need of homes.  Massive water shortages: Islands are extremely vulnerable to drought. Severe droughts are common, making water shortage of one of the most important climate-related risks in the region.",27/11/2018,https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/27/health/climate-change-impact-by-region/index.html
"World is woefully short of 2 degree goal for climate change, according to UN report","2017 had the highest levels of carbon emitted globallyCurrent projections would lead to 3.2 degrees C of warmingCountries goals are not ambitious enough to limit warming to 2 degrees C If there is one consistent message about climate change that has been made abundantly clear in a flurry of recent major assessments on the topic, it is that our planets climate is already changing, and now is the time to act to avoid devastating impacts. According to a United Nations report released Tuesday, however, projected emissions of carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas, from nations around the world fall woefully short of the 2 degree Celsius goal set in the Paris Climate Agreement in 2015. In fact, the report states that the current emission targets for all countries would result in an average global temperature rise of 3.2 degrees Celsius (5.8 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100. A 3.2 degree warmer world by the end of this century would bring about many of the dire consequences for human health, global economies and sea level rise that are projected from the higher-emission scenarios (also known as worst-case scenarios). The 2018 Emissions Gap Report is the flagship annual report from the UN Environment Program and acts as a report card on how countries are doing on their individual contributions to the Paris Climate Agreement; it also helps determine the gap between those expected contributions and what will be necessary to stay within the range of 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial temperatures (before burning fossil fuels for industrial needs led to major increases in greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere). This years report shows the largest gap ever, resulting from increasing emissions and slow action to mitigate. The foreboding message in the report aligns with the recent findings in the Special Report on 1.5 Degrees issued last month by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), that the world is failing to act fast enough to avoid the dire future climate and weather and time is quickly running out. According to Tuesdays report, global emissions of CO2 in 2017 were 53.5 gigatons (a gigaton is 1 billion tons), the most ever released into the atmosphere, representing an increase of more than 1% over 2016 emissions. Global emissions need to be 25% lower than this figure by 2030 in order to limit warming to 2 degrees Celsius and 55% lower in order to limit to 1.5 degrees, the report claims. The increase in 2017 follows relatively stable global emissions from 2014 through 2016, a period that allowed for optimism that global greenhouse gas emissions may be peaking. But Tuesdays report shatters that optimism. Global peaking of emissions by 2020 is crucial for achieving the temperature targets of the Paris Agreement, the report states, but the scale and pace of current action remains insufficient. Global emissions are not expected to peak by 2030, let alone 2020. In fact, only those of 57 countries (representing 60% of global emissions) are projected to peak by 2030. The authors of the report conclude that nations must be more ambitious in their projected emission cuts, increasing them by three times in order to meet the 2 degrees goal and by five times to meet the 1.5 degrees goal by 2030. Knowing that level of action is extremely unlikely, the 2018 Emissions Gap Report points to the growing potential of non-state actors to help reach global emissions goals. These include smaller governing bodies such as city, state and regional governments, as well as private entities such as companies, investors and civil organizations.Climate change is killing people now, and its getting much deadlier In addition to simply reducing their own carbon emissions, these entities build confidence in governments concerning climate policy and push for more ambitious national goals, according to the report. Another potential gap-filling tool the report highlights is fiscal policy reform, including fossil fuel taxes and subsidies to low-emission alternatives, which can create strong incentives for low-carbon investments and reduce emissions. The report will be a key talking point as key environmental figures convene in Poland next week as part of COP24, where the stated goal is to adopt a plan to execute the Paris Agreement, affecting climate and energy policy for the coming years. The United States is the only country not in the Paris Climate Agreement after President Trump pulled the country out of the pact in 2017, claiming it placed draconian financial burdens on the American people.",27/11/2018,https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/27/world/climate-change-un-emission-report-2018-wxc/index.html
"Climate change is already here, and heat waves are having the biggest effect, report says","Climate change is here and affecting our health, with extreme heat in particular also having effects on productivity, food supply and disease transmission, a new global report finds. More people than ever are vulnerable to heat exposure globally, and numbers are rising, according to The Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change report by an international group of researchers, published Wednesday. It comes just days after climate reports from the US government and the United Nations said that greater action on climate change is needed, with the UN report showing that in 2017, the highest levels of carbon were emitted globally. Older people in Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean are most vulnerable because of larger aging and urban populations there. The latest report estimates that 42% of over-65s in Europe and 43% in the the Eastern Mediterranean are already vulnerable to heat exposure; 38% of this group is vulnerable in Africa and 34% in Asia. The report identified present-day changes impacting public health including lower productivity, decreased crop yields and spread of diseases such as dengue and cholera, said researchers from 27 global institutions, including universities and research centers, and the UN who put together the study. Present changes in heat waves and labor capacity provide an early warning of the compounded and overwhelming impact on public health that is expected if temperatures continue to rise, said Hilary Graham, professor of health sciences at the University of York in the UK, who participated in the report. In 2017, 157 million vulnerable people were exposed to heat waves globally, and 153 billion hours of labor were lost due to heat exposure. The United States has seen more frequent and longer-lasting heatwaves and a rise in vector-borne disease, with cases of diseases transmitted by mosquitoes, ticks and fleas such as Lyme disease and West Nile virus tripling between 2004 and 2016, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Dr. Nick Watts, executive director of The Lancet Countdown, stressed that this is not something thats happening in 2050 but something that were already seeing today. High- and low- income countries are affected negatively, said Elizabeth Robinson, professor of environmental economics at the University of Reading, who was involved in the report. This just manifests in different ways, she added. The second in a series, with the first released last year, the report analyzes 41 indicators tracking the link between climate change and health in five areas: climate change impacts, resilience for health, mitigation actions, finance and public engagement. Robinson explained that there is a lot of variability year on year, but the trend appears to be upwards, indicating even more heat wave events in the future. Similarly, numbers of vulnerable people are going up over time. There have been some promising trends, like an increase in renewable energy, with jobs in that sector rising by 5.7% between 2016 and 2017, according to the report. But the investment in renewables is not yet anything like what it would need to be if we are to get to the 1.5 degrees  a commitment agreed during the Paris Climate Agreement to limit average global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius from pre-Industrial Revolution levels, said Paul Ekins, professor of resources and environment policy at University College London, who was involved in the report. Some positive trends were also identified in the form of coal phaseouts and cleaner, healthier transportation methods. But coal usage needs to be at 20% of 2010 usage levels by 2040 to meet targets, the report states. Dr. Renee Salas, doctor of emergency medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital, who authored the American chapter of the Lancet report, said it delivers a message of hope, as action is happening, but she pointed out that climate change is harming the health of this country now. This follows on from the outcome of the Fourth National Climate Assessment report published by the White House on Friday. This year marked a record summer in many parts of the world, with much higher temperatures than most populations are used to. Watts highlighted a recent study suggesting that the 2018 heat waves across Europe were made twice as likely as a result of climate change. Assigning attribution for every single event is difficult, but its clear that these sorts of events are examples of what is likely to come if we dont rapidly respond to climate change, he said. The research identified that the global population was on average exposed to a temperature increase of 0.8 degrees Celsius between 1986 and 2017. The global surface temperature change for this period was 0.3 degrees Celsius. This shows that populations are aging, growing and migrating in to the areas worst affected by climate change, Watts explained. Salas said that We must take aggressive action to combat climate change today so that by the end of the century, well have saved thousands of lives each year, along with hundreds of billions of dollars in public health cost. Small changes in temperature and rainfall will also help the spread of infectious diseases, the report found. For example, the capacity of the dengue virus to spread has increased by 7.8% since the 1950s. The seasonal capacity for the Aedes mosquito  the primary species spreading Zika, dengue and chikungunya  and its ability to spread have lengthened and strengthened, the report says. 2016 had the most dengue transmission on record, according to the report, and the spread is expected to rise in line with greenhouse gas emissions. Kristie Ebi, a professor of global health at the University of Washington who also was involved in the report, said the geographic spread of the mosquito that can carry dengue, Zika and chikunguya has increased dramatically with higher temperatures. She added that the researchers dont see the impacts individually but stressed the wide-ranging effects of climate change. Levels of global cholera bacteria are also worrying. An increasing trend of rising suitability to Vibrio, the bacteria that can cause cholera and some other illnesses, has been observed globally. The United States witnessed a 27% increase in coastline areas that are suitable for Vibrio infections between the 1980s and 2010s. We can not ignore these challenges we are seeing, said Gina McCarthy, director of the Center for Climate, Health and the Global Environment at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who was not involved in report. She cited the California wildfires and the rise in vector-borne diseases. A lack of progress in reducing emissions continues to endanger lives and public health care systems, according to the researchers. Europe was the region with most premature deaths from ambient air pollution in the form of PM2.5  particulates smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter  in 2015, followed by the Western Pacific and Southeast Asia, the report found. Particulate matter can settle in airways and cause problems like cardiovascular disease, respiratory conditions and cancers, leading to premature death, according to the World Health Organization. Paul Ekins, a professor of resources and environment policy at University College London who was involved in the report, stressed that any notion we may have that somehow in Europe, we are kind of doing better than other regions should be displaced. Extreme heat as a result of climate change cost the world 153 billion hours of work last year, the report found. In China alone, 21 billion hours of work were lost to extreme heat in 2017, equal to 1.4% of the countrys working population. Robinson said that rising temperatures have a direct impact on labor. The majority of labor hours losses occurred in more vulnerable regions such as India, southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa and South America. After decades of global improvement in food security, the report shows that crop yields are falling in 30 countries, including Cuba, the UAE and Luxembourg. In some countries, the difference between the actual crop yield achieved and the maximum crop yield proves that negative impacts of climate change cancel out technological improvements, according to a 2011 study, published in the Nature international journal of science. Watts warned that the report shows over half  51%  of 478 global cities surveyed stated that their public health infrastructure will be seriously compromised by climate change, by overwhelming services with new health threats or from extreme weather events directly threatening health services. This means systemic failure, Watts said, like the shutdown of a hospital. Global spending on climate adaptation for health is at 4.8%  too little to keep in line with the Paris Climate Agreement, the researchers say. Europe and Southeast Asia are the biggest spenders, with low-income countries funding too little to meet their needs, according to the report. The report has upped the stakes for faster progress, Ekins said. He believes that the findings represent a worse outlook, because we werent moving fast enough for 2 degrees, as agreed in the 2009 Copenhagen Climate Conference, and were definitely not moving fast enough for 1.5 degrees. Watts noted that the Lancet Countdown report is not able to say in which direction the world is heading, but whichever way we go, it ends up shaping the health profile of countries for the next century.",28/11/2018,https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/28/health/global-climate-change-and-health-report-intl/index.html
More Americans and most Republicans now believe in climate change,"A growing number of Americans, including most Republicans, believe that climate change is happening, a shift in public opinion from three years ago. About 8 in 10 Americans believe the climate is changing, causing extreme weather. Two thirds of Republicans believe the same thing. A majority of Americans (54%) consider it a very serious problem, according to a Monmouth University poll released Thursday. The poll was conducted before the US government released its Fourth National Climate Assessment last Friday, warning of the devastating potential impacts of climate change. President Donald Trump, who has called climate change a hoax, dismissed the study compiled by 13 federal agencies, including 300 leading scientists. I dont believe it, Trump told reporters on Monday, adding that he had read some of the report. But a majority of the Presidents party feels otherwise about climate change. 64% of Republicans believe in climate change, compared to 49% in a 2015 Monmouth poll. Belief in climate change continues to be higher among Democrats and independents, and theres a partisan split over how serious the issue of climate change is, the poll notes. Of Democrats, 92% believe that climate change is happening. 82% of Democrats consider it a very serious issue  an increase of 19 points since the 2015 poll. Americans, however, remain divided on what is the main contributor to climate change. A plurality, 37%, say human activity and natural changes in the environment both contribute equally to climate change. Democrats more than Republicans and independents think human activity is mainly to blame. The US climate change report released last week warns that thousands of people could die, food will be more scarce, and the US economy could lose hundreds of billions of dollars  or, in the worst-case scenario, more than 10% of its GDP  by the end of the century due to climate change. Most Americans polled said they are in favor of the government doing more to reduce activities that are causing the climate to change and sea levels to rise, but a majority of Republicans, Democrats and independents lack confidence that the government can do so, according to the poll. The Monmouth poll was conducted by telephone from November 9-12 among 802 adults nationwide, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.",30/11/2018,https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/30/politics/climate-change-monmouth-poll/index.html
Why the Paris Agreement won? save us from climate change,"To get the best view of current progress to tackle global warming, you need to climb a large volcano in Hawaii. In the rarefied air atop the solidified lavas of Mauna Loa, more than 3,000 meters above the hubbub of modern civilization, sophisticated instruments hosted at the Mauna Loa Observatory take daily measurements of atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Started in 1958 by Charles Keeling, the long-term output of these measurements is a graceful curve, which trends gradually upwards through recent decades. You can follow the Keeling Curve on Twitter  earlier this year CO2 levels passed 410 parts per million, higher than at any time since the Pliocene, about three million years ago. The Keeling Curve is a reality check, because it shows not the slightest downward blip despite increasingly intense international efforts to restrain greenhouse gas emissions. Remember the 1997 Kyoto Protocol? You wont see it on the Keeling Curve. Nor will you find any sign of the Copenhagen Accord of 2009, or even the much-heralded Paris Agreement of 2015. In other words  despite all the noise and fanfare, the sleepless nights and long days suffered by delegates at the annual UN Climate Change Conferences (the Conference of Parties, or COPs), all the pledges on solar targets and coal peaking dates  humanity hasnt yet done enough to make a tangible difference to the relentless accumulation of carbon dioxide in our planets atmosphere. To find out the reason for this lack of progress, look no further than the International Energy Agencys annual reports. In 2000, the share of global primary energy supply coming from fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) was 80%. In 2006 it was 81%. And in 2017 it was... drumroll... 81% again. Read: World is woefully short of 2 degree goal for climate change, according to UN report Yes, renewables  led by wind and solar  have grown enormously in recent years. But so has the global economy, and with it demand for energy to run our power stations, transport, industry and agriculture. In absolute terms clean energy can barely keep pace with growth, so the proportion of fossil fuels remains unchanged. The Paris Agreement included a paper commitment to aim to restrain the global temperature rise to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Weve hit 1 degree already, and unless greenhouse gas emissions are cut by half in the next 12 years  an economic and political impossibility  passing 1.5C is a virtual certainty. What about the other commitments that governments signed up to in Paris? According to the latest analysis by the Climate Action Tracker, current government policies will lead to a global temperature increase of 3.4C in 2100  well above the committed target of 2C, and certainly enough to cause catastrophic impacts that could threaten the entire future of human civilization. Read: To truly fight climate change, we need to set our sights higher In Paris governments volunteered to cut their emissions, but add together these commitments and the resulting emissions path restrains the ultimate rise in global temperatures by a mere 0.2C, yielding a rise of 3.2C by 2100. It gets worse. The current political surge in right-wing populism, exemplified most by the election of President Trump  who duly made a prime-time announcement that America would withdraw from the Paris Agreement  endangers even the tiny progress that has so far been made. Many of these populist movements make anti-science denialism an article of faith, with climate change action the most high-profile casualty. Australias right-wing government has hinted it might follow Trumps example in ditching Paris, while president elect Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil has indicated he will redouble the destruction of the Amazon rainforest, where the pace of deforestation has already increased. Read: Donald Trump buried a climate change report because I dont believe it Where public pressure to enforce reductions in carbon emissions shows any sign of succeeding, fossil fuels companies pour millions into efforts to squash it. For example BP pumped around $12 million into the successful effort to block a moderate carbon tax in Washington state. Overall, fossil fuels companies outspend environmental groups by a margin of 10 to one. And the greens themselves have scored some notable own goals. Germanys push to eliminate nuclear power has led to a renewed dependence on coal, and the bulldozing of ancient forests due to the resulting expansion of open-cast coal mining. Everywhere around the world that nuclear plants have been closed, they have been replaced by fossil fuels, worsening our climate emergency. Recognizing this, the US environmental group the Union of Concerned Scientists recently broke ranks with the wider environmental movement in a new report calling for nuclear stations threatened with closure to remain open so as not to increase power sector carbon emissions. In Taiwan grassroots climate activists wearing polar bear masks won a referendum overturning the previous nuclear-exit policy. In the UK a new climate action group, Extinction Rebellion, burst onto the scene over the last month with daring actions causing chaos in the center of London. Their message came through loud and clear  that if climate catastrophe is to be avoided, we will have to do more than issue polite but unenforceable pledges at annual UN conferences. The COP is important, but what happens out on the streets in the real world is more so. You can see a long distance from the top of that Hawaiian volcano, and the figures dont lie: CO2 is building up irrevocably with each year of delay. Despite decades of COPs, the fight to save the Earths climate from collapse has still barely begun.",03/12/2018,https://edition.cnn.com/2018/12/03/opinions/paris-agreement-wont-save-us/index.html
"Tackling climate change could save millions of lives, report says","Climate studies often pinpoint the detrimental public health impacts related to rising atmospheric temperatures, extreme weather events and other consequences of a changing climate. A report released by the World Health Organization on Wednesday details the public health benefits that could come with tackling the issue. Meeting the commitments of the 2015 Paris climate agreement could save millions of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars by the middle of the century, according to the report. Meeting the goals put forth in the Paris agreement would be expected to save more than 1 million lives a year from air pollution alone by 2050, it says. Drivers of climate change, principally fossil fuel combustion, contribute to about 7 million deaths worldwide from outdoor and indoor air pollution annually, according to the report. The Paris Agreement is a pledge among representatives from countries around the world to take action against climate change, specifically by reducing their nations carbon output and halting global warming below 2 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels by the end of the century. The United States pledged to withdraw from the landmark agreement last year. Global leaders and officials are now gathering for two weeks of meetings at the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP24, to create a rulebook that will turn the Paris climate agreement into a workable reality. They aim to establish rules, figure out financing and build ways to verify that nations are meeting their commitments. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for action Monday in Poland, telling gathered delegates that we are in deep trouble with climate change. The new WHO report, launched at the COP24, is based on contributions from more than 80 health professionals, academic experts and representatives of civil society and international agencies who have worked on climate change and public health for more than three decades. The most direct link between climate change and ill health is air pollution, the authors wrote. Burning fossil fuels for power, transport and industry is the main source of the carbon emissions that are driving climate change and a major contributor to health-damaging air pollution, which every year kills over seven million people due to exposure inside and outside their homes, according to the report. The report provides recommendations for governments on how to tackle the issue of climate change. Those recommendations include identifying and promoting actions to reduce both carbon emissions and air pollution; mobilizing mayors and other subnational leaders to promote climate goals; engaging the health community in addressing climate change; and systematically tracking progress in health from such climate change mitigation. The report referenced an analysis showing that the value of the health gains from meeting the targets of the Paris climate agreement would be approximately twice the cost of the policies. General climate change-related health impacts named in the report include in the areas of mental illness, undernutrition, injuries, respiratory disease, allergies, cardiovascular disease, infectious diseases, poisoning, waterborne diseases and heatstroke. Only about 3% of health resources are invested in the prevention of climate change-related impacts, and only about 0.5% of multilateral climate funds have been dispersed specifically for health projects, according to the report. The new WHO report is the fourth in the past two months to warn of the detrimental health impacts of climate change, said Dr. Mona Sarfaty, executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health and director of the program on climate and health at George Mason Universitys Center for Climate Change Communication. She was not involved in the report. In October, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in a report that the planet will reach the crucial threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels by as early as 2030, precipitating the risk of extreme drought, wildfires, floods and food shortages for hundreds of millions of people. Then, in November, a separate report called The Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change showed how extreme heat from climate change already has been affecting productivity, food supply and disease transmission worldwide. Also last month, the US governments National Climate Assessment warned that the economy could lose hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century due to climate change-related impacts. The new WHO report comes with a message that addressing climate change is an area of opportunity. It will improve our health, it will save money, and it will also stimulate economic development, because people who are healthier are able to be more productive, Sarfaty said. The other reports share this message of possibility and potential for benefit. As for the Paris Agreement, theres no question that if we meet those goals, well save lives, and we will decrease the burden on the health delivery system, which will mean that people wont face as much poor health and wont end up in the hospital as frequently. Both  that saving of lives and of health care services  will save us money. So we save lives, we improve health, and we save money, she said. This isnt just a story about threats; its a story about benefits we can gain if we go forward into a future powered by clean energy and highly efficient energy use, she said. The drivers of climate change  such as fossil fuel burning and large-scale livestock production  are already posing a burden on public health, through air pollution and effects on respiratory and heart conditions, said Irva Hertz-Picciotto, a professor of public health sciences and director of the Environmental Health Sciences Center at UC Davis Health, who was not involved in the new report but has been studying the effects of recent wildfires in California on human health. San Francisco, Stockton and Sacramento were the worlds three most polluted cities in mid-November due to those wildfires, according to Berkeley Earth, a nonprofit that aggregates data from air-quality monitoring sites. The air pollution from the California wildfires has big implications for the health of millions of people in the area. For instance, after the 2017 Northern California fires were out  Sonoma and Napa were two of the counties  survivors who did not have a pre-existing respiratory condition were reporting respiratory symptoms still six months out, Hertz-Picciotto said. So thats some of what were seeing, she said. And thats just one tiny piece of this larger discussion around climate change and health. As mentioned in the new WHO report, at the local level people can make really important changes, and that can help empower communities and in fact make meaningful changes at those local levels that will both reduce greenhouse gas emissions and be helpful in improving health and in terms of making cities more livable, she said. One of the main  and critical  messages in this report is that you cant really separate climate changes from health  both in the short-run and the long-run.",05/12/2018,https://edition.cnn.com/2018/12/05/health/climate-change-cop24-who-study/index.html
Human-induced climate change makes heatwaves 30 times more likely,"Human-induced climate change has made the United Kingdoms record-breaking 2018 summer heatwave around 30 times more likely than under normal conditions, the countrys meteorological body has said. The UK as a whole endured its joint hottest summer on record in 2018, and the hottest ever for England. Temperatures peaked in the east of England, reaching 35.6C (96F) in Felsham, Suffolk on July 27, and the UKs average temperature matched previous highs recorded in 2006, 2003 and 1976. A new analysis from the UKs national weather service, the Met Office, presented at the United Nations COP24 climate change conference in Katowice, Poland Thursday, has shown that the UK now has an approximately 12% chance of average summer temperatures being as high as in 2018. Such temperatures would typically have a less than 0.5% chance of occurring under natural climate conditions. Our provisional study compared computer models based on todays climate with those of the natural climate we would have had without human-induced emissions, said Professor Peter Stott from the Met Office and Exeter University. Stott noted that the rapidly increasing changes stem from an increase in the concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the Earths atmosphere. Carbon dioxide concentrations reached 405.5 parts per million (ppm) in the atmosphere in 2017, compared with an atmospheric concentration of around 280 ppm in the pre-industrial era (pre-1750). A new report published this week by the Global Carbon Project, an international research project on global sustainability, revealed that fossil fuel emissions rose by 1.7% in 2017, and are set to rise further by 2.7% this year, to 37.1 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide. The Met Office warned that soaring temperatures are having an increasing impact on peoples lives. The extreme temperatures experienced in the UK and around the world during summer 2018 had a significant impact upon many peoples lives, Met Office chief scientist Professor Stephen Belcher said in a statement. We now live in a climate in which heatwaves occur more frequently and, depending on the choices we make around greenhouse gas emissions, we could reach a point in the future when we can expect a hot summer like that of 2018 to occur every year, he concluded. A quarterly mortality report published by the UKs Office for National Statistics showed that there were 259 more deaths on June 25 and 26 this year compared with the five-year average of 2,146 for the two days. Crop failures were also recorded across the country, Northern Ireland introduced its first hosepipe ban since 1995, and critical drinking-water reservoirs ran dry. Kathryn Brown, the head of adaptation in the UKs Committee on Climate Change, which advises the government, told CNN that the report reinforces that the government must redouble its efforts to address the impacts of high temperatures and lack of rain. The government must address the issue of greater shortages in water supplies for people, agriculture, industry and the natural environment, whilst improving shading and ventilation in new-build properties as well as reversing the decline of urban green spaces, she said. Without action, the number of heat-related deaths could increase from 2,000 per year today to 7,000 by the 2050s as a result of climate change and population growth.",06/12/2018,https://edition.cnn.com/2018/12/06/health/climate-change-uk-summer-heatwave-gbr-intl/index.html
Investors with $32 trillion at stake sound the alarm on climate change,"Investors managing assets worth $32 trillion have called on governments and businesses to step up efforts to tackle climate change. A group of 415 investors warned Monday of an ambition gap between steps governments have promised to take, and the actions needed to meet goals set out in the Paris climate agreement. The statement from the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change has been endorsed by financial heavyweights including HSBC (HSBC), Nomura Asset Management and UBS Asset Management. The group, which controls assets worth more than twice the value of the Chinese economy, claims that its push is the single largest policy intervention from investors on climate change. Much more needs to be done by governments to accelerate the low carbon transition and to improve the resilience of our economy, society and the financial system to climate risks, the group said in a statement. The plea comes as world leaders gather in Katowice, Poland, for an annual summit on climate change. The investor group urged governments to phase out thermal coal power and fossil fuel subsidies, and set a price for carbon emissions. They called on companies to provide more information on climate risks. Leading on climate change can produce big gains including new jobs and investment, the group argued. The countries and companies that lead in implementing the Paris Agreement and enacting strong climate and low carbon energy policies will see significant economic benefits, it said. Global investors are becoming more active in pushing companies to take meaningful actions to combat climate change. Follow This, a Dutch activist shareholder group that helped pushed Shell (RDSA) on climate change, has started a similar campaign targeting BP. The group announced Monday that it has filed a shareholder resolution demanding that BP (BP) sets hard targets for cutting carbon emissions. It said it will target ExxonMobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) with similar resolutions. We keep making the same fair ask ... we request these companies to align their targets with the Paris Climate Agreement, said Mark van Baal, the groups leader. BP said it had received the resolution and will consider it carefully. Follow This recently scored a major victory after years of campaigns focused on Shell. The energy company said earlier this month that it would start linking executive pay to climate change goals. With Shell, weve seen how effective climate resolutions are, said van Baal.",10/12/2018,https://edition.cnn.com/2018/12/10/business/climate-change-investors-cop24/index.html
5 things the Trump admin has done that go against its climate change warning,"Since the Trump administration released its blockbuster report on the day after Thanksgiving outlining the dire environmental and economic impacts of climate change, it has made a series of policy and diplomatic decisions or statements that appear to run counter to all of the warnings in the report. In fact, none are designed to reduce fossil fuel emissions, which the report said is needed to combat extreme climate change, which otherwise will cause substantial damages to the US economy, environment, and human health and well-being over the coming decades. President Donald Trump, who previously has called climate change a hoax, has rejected the reports conclusion that climate change could be devastating for the economy, saying I dont believe it. Heres what the administration has said and done since Thanksgiving: The Environmental Protection Agency last week proposed relaxing regulations for newly-built coal-fueled power plants. Combined with another proposal to replace the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, the two rules would overhaul the way coal-fired plants are built and regulated. EPA acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler said the carbon-capture technology required by the Obama-era made constructing new power plants too expensive. But the decline of coal for power plants has been a long-term trend regardless as the energy industry has moved to less expensive sources such as natural gas. Environmentalists worry the proposed rule suggests the EPA will set new standards that would weaken the requirements that the agency uses to regulate other types of pollution. The administration may be trying to lower the bar significantly for future new sources of pollution that the EPA tries to regulate, said Mary Anne Hitt, senior director of the Sierra Clubs Beyond Coal campaign. Considering Trump announced the US would walk away from the Paris climate agreement  which brought together the rest of the world  its no surprise the US continues to be an outlier on the international stage. The US sided with Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait over the weekend at the COP24 global climate summit in Poland to contest language supporting a landmark climate report on limiting global warming. Countries were asked to welcome the report put out by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which says governments around the world must take rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society to avoid disastrous levels of global warming. The US and the three other nations sided against welcoming the measure. The United States was willing to note the report and express appreciation to the scientists who developed it, but not to welcome it, as that would denote endorsement of the report, the State Department said in a statement. As we have made clear in the IPCC and other bodies, the United States has not endorsed the findings of the report, it added. Cabinet secretaries and other senior US officials have attended the climate summits in the past, but the administration instead sent a delegation of working-level staff is attending the meeting, as are representatives from US states and businesses. Meanwhile, Energy Secretary Rick Perry visited Qatar and Saudi Arabia. At the recent G20 meeting in Argentina, which came just days after the release of that dire climate report, US diplomats insisted on noting that the US reaffirmed its intention to withdraw from the Paris accord. A clause in a communique signed by the member nations says the US reiterates its decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, and affirms its strong commitment to economic growth and energy access and security, utilizing all energy sources and technologies, while protecting the environment. The separate language was required for Trump to sign off on the communique, a senior US official said. When the US Geological Survey last week announced a major discovery of oil and natural gas underneath Texas and New Mexico, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke called it a gift. Christmas came a few weeks early this year, he said. American strength flows from American energy, and as it turns out, we have a lot of American energy. Zinkes position involves the dual and sometimes competing roles of overseeing leases to develop resources  such as oil, natural gas, and minerals  and preserving federal lands for wildlife and human recreational uses. The Interior Department proposed to cut protections that benefited the sage grouse, a grassland bird that lives in the Great Plains and western states, which could allow for expanded oil and drilling. The plan would remove protections on nearly 9 million acres of protected habitat. The oil industry says any impacts minimal because of improved technology and more limited footprint needed for exploration.",10/12/2018,https://edition.cnn.com/2018/12/10/politics/climate-change-trump-report-epa-cop24/index.html
"In 200 years, humans reversed a climate trend lasting 50 million years, study says","What do scientists see when comparing our future climate with the past? In less than 200 years, humans have reversed a multimillion-year cooling trend, new research suggests. If global warming continues unchecked, Earth in 2030 could resemble its former self from 3 million years ago, according to a study published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences finds. During that ancient time, known as the mid-Pliocene epoch, temperatures were higher by about 2 to 4 degrees Celsius (3.6 to 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) and sea levels were higher by roughly 20 meters (almost 66 feet) than today, explained Kevin D. Burke, lead author of the study and a researcher and Ph.D. candidate at the Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Today is one of the most difficult scenarios weve ever found ourselves in, Burke said. This is a very rapid period of climatic change. Looking for anything that we can do to curb those emissions is important. Climate scientists say that our globe is about 1 degree Celsius hotter today than it was between 1850 and 1900 and that this is due in part to gas emissions from cars, planes and other human activities. Some gases, including carbon dioxide and methane, trap heat in the atmosphere, producing a greenhouse effect that makes the planet warmer. The new study is basically a similarity assessment, Burke said. We have projections of future climate available for the year 2020, 2030 and so forth. For nearly 30 future decades, then, he and his co-authors drew future-to-past comparisons based on six reference periods. The reference periods were the Historical, about mid-20th century; the Pre-Industrial, around 1850; the mid-Holocene, about 6,000 years ago; the last Interglacial Period, about 125,000 years ago; the mid-Pliocene, about 3 million years ago; and the early Eocene, about 50 million years ago. If we continue our current level of greenhouse gas emissions  what some would say is a business as usual scenario  the overall global climate in 2030 will most closely resemble the overall climate of the mid-Pliocene period, Burke said. What did Earth look like then? Annual temperatures on average were about 2 to 4 degrees Celsius warmer than today, there was little permanent ice cover in the Northern Hemisphere, and the sea level was about 20 meters higher. In some places, though, including cities in the United States, temperatures in 2030 would be roughly double the global average. Burke presented a second scenario: If we continue as we are doing now, we see that by the year 2150, future climates have an analog [or equivalent] coming from the Eocene, the climate of 50 million years before present. Proxies and models tell us that it may have been as much as, globally, on average 13 degrees Celsius [about 23 degrees Fahrenheit] warmer than present, Burke said. During that time period, there was essentially no permanent ice cover in either of the poles, so sea level would have been much higher as well. Although the geography and configuration of our continents and oceans were different at that time, there may have been swampy forests as far north as locations in the Arctic Circle, he said. Those different possible future outcomes are entirely dependent on the emissions scenario that we follow, he said. Burke admitted that the climate in and of itself wouldnt just wipe us out or anything, but its important to recognize that it would be a substantially different future. Flavio Lehner, a project scientist at the US National Center for Atmospheric Research, said whats new in the study is the attempt to draw parallels between past and future climates. Lehner, who was not involved in the research, said that comparisons to the past typically are complicated by many uncertainties that make it challenging to reconstruct and understand hydroclimate change, even over the last 1,000 years. The study here does not magically reduce these uncertainties but seems to circumvent the problem by relying heavily on climate model simulations of past climates, he said. Thats not necessarily a scientific breakthrough but still makes for an interesting study. Nick Obradovich, a research scientist in the scalable cooperation group at the MIT Media Lab, said it is well-established that the rate of warming we are currently experiencing is remarkable relative to historical rates of warming. Jumping back to climates not seen for millions of years  in the course of decades  will likely totally disrupt the future of humanity, said Obradovich, who also was not involved in the research. Its very possible that both ecological systems and human systems may fail to adapt rapidly enough, with devastating consequences. No one knows exactly how this future will look, but if we dont curtail emissions drastically and immediately, it isnt likely to be a pretty one. Burke emphasized, This isnt really a problem for the future; this is a problem for now. What were showing is that in the next decade or two, we may see climates like that of the Pliocene. To avoid that future, both political representatives and individuals need to take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, he said. Individually, we can take public transport or use bicycles instead of driving, he suggested. And we can eat less of a meat-based or beef-based diet. When you think about the number of people who could make a change like that, that could have a significant effect, Burke said. Anything that we can do to curb those emissions is important.",10/12/2018,https://edition.cnn.com/2018/12/10/world/climate-change-pliocene-study/index.html
"Climate change is not only influencing extreme weather events, it? causing them","17 different extreme events linked to global warmingSome events would not have occurred without warming""Attribution studies"" compare events to historical recordResults can help preparations for future extremes Extreme weather events that spanned the globe in 2017 have been directly linked to  and in some cases were even caused by  continued warming of the planet via human influence through greenhouse gas emissions, according to a new report. For the second year in a row, the annual report from the American Meteorological Society found weather extremes that could not have happened without human-caused warming of the climate. Advances in scientific modeling and additional climbs in temperatures are making the connection between global warming and extreme weather much more concrete. Global temperature, the backdrop in which extremes are unfolding, continues to rise. ... Nature is thereby increasingly rolling back its curtain of sensitivity to rising greenhouse gases, Martin Hoerling, a research scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and one of the authors of Mondays report, wrote in an email. This alone is making it easier to scientifically identify the fingerprint of human influence, not to mention improved modeling tools, Hoerling said. Scientists found that record warm waters in the Tasman Sea in 2017 and 2018 were virtually impossible without global warming, and they concluded that a crippling drought in East Africa that has led to food shortages for millions of people would not have occurred naturally before the Industrial Revolution, when humans began to interfere with the climate system. Included in the 17 events identified in the report in which global warming played a role were major floods such as those with Hurricane Harvey, fires, heat waves over land and in the ocean, and even record low sunshine in Japan in August 2017. The findings are part of an annual report titled Explaining Extreme Events in 2017 from a Climate Perspective, which reveals clear ties between recent extremes in weather and human influences of the climate. This is about understanding that climate is already changing the risks of extremes, said Jeff Rosenfeld, editor in chief of the Bulletin of the AMS, the journal in which the report was published. The report features the research of 120 scientists from 10 countries and examines a wide array of extreme weather and events from 2017. The scientists looked at how these events compare with historical observations as well as model simulations to determine whether there was influence from climate change. These type of comparisons, known as attribution studies, attempt to quantify humans role in making certain events more likely, or more extreme, through warming the planet. Attribution science has given everyone a rational, quantifiable way to talk about human-caused climate change as it manifests itself to people, Rosenfeld said, not as a technical number, a global trend, but as a concrete force in the risks we all face. New in this years report: perspective essays written by managers and planners in various sectors of society to show the importance the attribution studies and how they can help prepare for and navigate extreme events. For example, during Harvey, water managers in Texas and Louisiana were challenged with rainfall forecasts far beyond anything ever observed, and according to Julie Vano, a scientist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research who was involved in the report, the managers struggled to believe that much rainfall would actually fall. Attribution studies can be a tool to help us better understand these extremes that are increasingly beyond our experience, Vano said, but knowing how a warming atmosphere can influence these storms can help inform their decisions and enhance public safety to reduce impacts of extreme hazards. Not every extreme event is made more likely or more impactful by climate change. According to Hoerling, over the 7-yr period [that the annual report has been released], about 30% of studies found little to no impact of climate change on an events intensity or likelihood of occurrence. But advances in the science of attributing extreme events to climate change are providing useful  and potentially legally necessary  information that must be taken into account by future planners in the public and private sectors. This report tells us that the science that informs building safety and structural design criteria  from farms to factories to homes and office buildings  is changing, Lindene Patton, an attorney with the Earth & Water Law Group, who participated in the study and provided context on how attribution science could lead to legal liability for extreme weather events, wrote in an email. Patton explained how such things as building codes and spill-protection plans must be created using the knowledge that more severe/intense events are likely due to global warming, and negligence of the matter could create legal liability. Both the American Society for Civil Engineers and the American Institute for Chemical Engineers are pursuing efforts to evaluate the impacts of climate change on their best practices that inform liability, according to Patton. Heat waves like the one in southern Europe and the Mediterranean in 2017, dubbed Lucifer in the media, are now three times more likely than they were in 1950, the report says. And though it wasnt included in this years report because it happened too recently, extreme drought and heat wave this year in Europe saw temperatures climb above 32 degrees Celsius (90 degrees Fahrenheit) all the way to the Arctic Circle in Scandinavia and unprecedented drought in north and central Europe. Hurricane Harveys rainfall, which totaled over 60 inches over the course of four days in late August 2017, was worsened by a warmer climate providing warmer-than-normal ocean temperatures and more moisture in the air, a fact backed up by multiple studies, the report says. Not all of the impacts from these climate extremes are direct. Extremely warm sea surface temperatures off the coast of Africa doubled the probability of drought in East Africa, leaving more than 6 million people in Somalia facing food shortages. The analysis in the new report found that such extreme ocean heat would not have occurred in a pre-industrial climate, before human carbon emissions.",10/12/2018,https://edition.cnn.com/2018/12/10/world/climate-change-extreme-events-wxc/index.html
One suspected driver of the migrant ?aravan? climate change,"Each night after her husband left, Delmi Amparo Hernandez walked to a neighbors house to look for him on the TV news. He had fled their mountaintop community here in rural Honduras without a phone because no one in the family could afford one. Their floor was made of dirt, they grew their own food. Watching coverage of the migrant caravan heading for the United States was Hernandezs only way to know if he was alive. What she saw in the broadcasts were visions from hell. Families jumping from bridges, getting kidnapped along dusty roads, dodging tear gas cannons fired by police from richer nations. How could this be? She continued scanning, hoping to find him, hoping not to. She had begged German Ramirez not to go, but her 30-year-old husband had his reasons. The towns corn and bean crops had failed during a years-long drought. There was no work aside from farming. No money for irrigation. Their four children, ages 3 to 13, had little to eat. Ramirez told his wife that he had no choice but to leave with the caravan of thousands that had formed in Honduras and would make its way north. This was their chance, she recalled him saying that day. He could go with the group, find work, send back money. It was this or risk starvation. The couples tragic story, as well as others I heard on a recent four-day trip to western Honduras, complicates two narratives being told about the migrant caravan. To hear President Trump tell it, Central American Gang Members and some very bad people are attempting to storm the United States at its southern border. This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you, the President wrote on Twitter. American news reports, meanwhile, largely have focused on high rates of violent crime in Honduras and El Salvador that have driven families to seek asylum as refugees in the United States. Overlooked is this factor: climate change. The dry corridor of Central America, which includes parts of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua, has been hit with an unusual drought for the last five years. Crops are failing. Starvation is lurking. More than two million people in the region are at risk for hunger, according to an August report from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization. Under normal circumstances, without any change in rain patterns, people are already struggling, said Edwin Castellanos, dean of research at Universidad del Valle de Guatemala and a global authority on climate change in Central America. In some of these dry areas, we have seen events of children actually dying out of hunger. So, it is that extreme. This drought has been longer and more intense than those seen before in the dry corridor, Castellanos said. The failure of critical springtime rains is also new, he said, and is causing such problems for farmers whose crops depend on that water. Subsistence crops like corn and beans are all but dying. Our crew saw beans the size of Tic Tacs. And shriveled, partially blackened ears of corn could fit inside your palm. Kevin McAleenan, commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection, said in a speech on Friday that drought and crop failures in Honduras and Guatemala directly translate into whos arriving at our border. Studies have not definitively tied this particular drought to climate change, but computer models show droughts like the one happening now are becoming more common as the world warms. Thousands have risked their lives to flee these circumstances. And previously unpublished data shows people started leaving certain areas of Honduras amid crop failures  even as homicide rates were declining. Take Copan, the region of Honduras that German Ramirez fled in October. In fiscal year 2012, around the start of the drought, only about 20 family members from Copan were apprehended by the US Border Patrol while trying to cross the US-Mexico border, according to a data analysis of records shared with CNN by Stephanie Leutert, director of the Mexico Security Initiative at The University of Texas at Austin. Then drought hit, its cumulative effects growing as the years wore on. In 2017, about 1,450 family members from Copan were apprehended by US authorities at the border, the data show. In fiscal year 2018, with the data ending in September, the number of migrants picked up was more than 2,500. Those figures are absolutely an underestimation, said Leutert. Youre missing people who left Copan and went to big cities, youre missing people who left Copan and went to another place in the region, youre missing people who tried to go to the United States and didnt make it  and youre missing people who went to the United States and crossed undetected. The figure is a baseline that shows something big is happening, she said. Any persons decision to abandon their homeland is complex. For some, violence is part of it. As is extreme poverty. In Central America, its often a combination of things. But theres another truth: This region is becoming less hospitable to farmers as more-industrialized countries burn loads of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas. A December report shows the world is on track to create 37.1 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide pollution in 2018  yet another record. This pollution traps heat and warms the planet, making cyclical weather events like droughts, floods and certain storms worse. The United States, which is the destination for so many migrants fleeing Honduras, bears outsize responsibility for global warming. Cumulatively, the nation has done more to cause climate change since the Industrial Revolution than any other. Today, President Trump supports increased coal production and has pledged to abandon the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to at most 2 degrees Celsius. A rulebook for that agreement is being debated this week at the COP24 conference in Katowice, Poland, with the United States on the sidelines. Notably, Trump also has also made immigration his signature issues, rallying supporters around the idea of stopping people from Latin America, like German Ramirez, from crossing illegally into the United States. Theres broad support for a crackdown on illegal immigration in the United States among Republican voters. A quarter of US midterm voters said that immigration was their No. 1 issue, and 75% of those voters were Republicans, according to a November exit poll. Build that wall has become a popular chant at Trump political rallies. Federal authorities have met would-be migrants at the border near San Diego with tear gas. Officials say the tear-gassing occurred after migrants threw rocks at authorities. Yet theres an unspoken irony here. The nation thats become a destination for so many migrants  a beacon of opportunity and hope is contributing to the conditions forcing some people to abandon home. Think of Central America like an island. Thats advice from Castellanos, the climate scientist in Guatemala. Hes not talking about just any old island. Hes referencing the specks of land in the Pacific  Kiribati, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands  whose very existence is threatened by rising sea levels that are linked to global warming. I visited the Marshall Islands in 2015 after readers of CNNs Two Degrees series voted for me to do a story on climate refugees. Higher tides and increased flooding were already pushing people out  and to Arkansas, of all places. These little islands gained a huge voice at the United Nations climate talks in Paris in December of that year  the predecessor to the talks happening now in Poland. Calling themselves the High Ambition Coalition, island diplomats rallied with richer nations to make a moral case for climate action  saying their sovereign territory would vanish if global temperatures were allowed to warm more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. That goal became embedded in the Paris Agreement. In order to achieve it, global carbon emissions would need to be cut in half in about a decade. The climate problem in Central America isnt so much sea-level rise. But Castellanos told me an argument can be made that the region is nearly as susceptible to global warming. It is a slim stretch of land connecting North and South America  a string of land between continents. That makes it vulnerable to storms coming from the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean. Climate change is supercharging those. Plus, climate models show both floods and droughts getting more intense. The United Nations Development Programme considers Honduras to be highly vulnerable to climate change, both now and in the future as the atmosphere continues to warm. The dry corridor gets that name because its long been dry, situated behind a mountain range that catches weather from the Caribbean. But the recent drought there has challenged notions about how bad a drought in Central America could be, Castellanos told me. Some areas have seen 10 consecutive months without rain. Central Americans have an expression  I was waiting for you like the rains in May. It references the fact that massive rains fall in May and June, like clockwork each year. Farmers plant their crops accordingly, counting on the spring rains to soak the plants and ensure a productive harvest. Many people here are subsistence farmers and cant afford irrigation systems. Theyre completely at the mercy of rains, and those rains arent coming. When they do come, they come all at once  causing floods and damage. Here, unlike in the United States, we dont have a problem of convincing people that climate change is real, Castellanos told me. People are convinced by what they see. German Ramirez, the farmer on the hilltop in Copan, lived through this. Then he heard the caravan was passing near his village. People believed that traveling together would provide safety. From Honduras to Guatemala to Mexico, the number would grow into the thousands. In mid-October, Ramirez fled Copan on foot, hoping to catch the caravan. He carried a small backpack with a few items of clothing, his wife said. In his pocket was a paper with a neighbors telephone number on it. That phone would ring in the village some time later. It would not be Ramirezs voice on the phone. And the news would not be good. I came to meet the people left behind. The location: several communities in the Copan Department of Honduras, near the Guatemala border. Id chosen the place because of the data CNN analyzed with Stephanie Leutert, from the University of Texas. The data, which tracks families apprehended at the US-Mexico border, does not prove on its own that people are fleeing Copan because of climate change. But the figures do support the idea that people newly started fleeing during that timeframe. The first point is that the exodus from Copan has grown faster than in the rest of Honduras. In 2012, only 3.7% of Honduran migrants came from that area. By 2018, up to September, it was more than 9%. Meanwhile, the number of murders per year in Copan has been declining. Again, this provides only a rough sketch of whats happening, Leutert said, but it is clear that climate change is one factor driving people from the region. Climate change is reducing (crop) yields, she said. Its like a tax. Its making things harder for people and industries that rely on weather stability. Sometimes climate change can push people over the edge and make it impossible (to survive). We see that with the coffee industry. That last added cost is making the business model unsustainable  and pushing people to migrate. Copan is a mountainous place of dense forest and sweeping valleys. In the morning, mist rises from the hills like steam, making it look like molten ripples of land have just cooled. By afternoon, clouds hang on the hilltops, threatening to rain but rarely cracking. Dried-up corn stalks, which look almost unrecognizable if youre used to the engineered, Midwestern variety, dart around at odd angles between rocks and patches of dirt, clinging to steep hillsides. The more fertile land is the valleys, where most crops grow. Even during the worst of the drought, some vegetation here is green and appears almost lush. But Castellanos and others told me its the timing and amount of rain thats critical. And many months here are now totally dry. What was it like to live in this place? And how and when did people feel it was impossible to stay? Our team drove south past a town that was abandoned by the Mayan people thousands of years ago and now is known for the remaining artifacts. Our tires kicked up dust from the path, coating every roadside fern in a film of beige. At a construction site, Evelio Ochoa, 35, was pouring cement into the land  helping build the foundation of a home for his niece. Hes doing any odd job he can find these days. Years ago, he told me, he paid a coyote  a smuggler  to help him leave Honduras. His small plot of corn and bean crops had failed, he said. The coyotes price: 60,000 Lempiras, or about $2,500. He got the money from a relative, he said. That price bought him three attempts to reach the United States. He made the first attempt in 2014, he told me, amid record drought. The second was earlier this year. Both times he was deported, he said. If he failed a third time, there would be no money to try again. You dont fear for yourself, you fear for your family, Ochoa said of setting out on the journey. The moment you step out of the house and start walking its difficult  not because of the danger but because you miss your family and are thinking about their safety. In September, Ochoa said, authorities caught him a third time. He finds himself back in Honduras, struggling to feed his family. Ochoas wife, Nora Vazques, said she and their five children would have starved if a relative hadnt been sending money from the United States. The 33-year-old mother, whose children are ages 1 to 12, showed me a basket of unusable black corn kernels, picked from a rotten crop. Before, the rain was much better, she said standing in the shadow of her doorway, the midday light half-illuminating her face. Her hand shook as she wiped away tears. He grew a lot of corn back then, she said. Now we are losing most of the crops. Lisandro Mauricio Arias is mayor of the town the Mayans abandoned. We met at the town square, which is surrounded by tile roofs and palm trees. Copan Ruinas is a tourist destination that boasts several quaint hotels, but the town has seen better times. For that reason, I figured Arias might downplay the outmigration that data shows is occurring here  that he might have an incentive to say the drought hasnt been so bad. He didnt do that. The town is emptying out, he told me. How many people have left? His guess: 30%. He regrets that, but says it may be the only way. When analyzing precipitation levels, we can see they have changed a lot  which is really alarming, he said. Problems associated with drought will get worse. We respect the decisions the United States is making, he added. Its their country, and they have the right to defend it. However, I believe they need to take into consideration the human factor  what is humanity? These people are not trying to meddle. [They are] looking for an opportunity to survive. Among those people are the sons of Mariano and Gregoria Perez. The two young men, ages 19 and 26, are stuck in Tijuana, Mexico, according to their family in Honduras. Their parents have only been able to speak with them two or three times, they said, because phone credit is so expensive. (I was unable to reach them.) What the mens parents know are only the barest of details. One son was mugged and lost all of his belongings, including his passport, according to Mariano Perez, 55. Gregoria said she told the boys they could come back home. Secretly, though, the family worries. The young men have crossed international borders illegally already. Could they come back? I would say that this is an injustice because they did not do anything wrong, said Gregoria Perez, who, like her husband, said the boys left because farming wasnt viable amid the drought, and there were no other options. They want to find work to sustain themselves. I sat down outside to talk with her husband as the sun was setting. He sat on a small wooden stool and I was on the ground. The angle and time of night rendered his face in silhouette. Mariano Perez told me his sons heard about the caravan on TV and left the same day. The father was down the hill helping a neighbor build a fence. He didnt know theyd left until he returned home that night. He doesnt fault them for it. He knew why they left, of course: drought. What bothers him is where they are now. He worries theyre hungry in Tijuana, as they were here. He worries they may not make it across the border. Sometimes, in his darker moments, he wonders if this is what God predicted in the book of Revelations  the end of the world, happening slowly and before his eyes. The next morning, I woke up to find my news feed full of images of tent camps in Tijuana. It had started raining on the migrants. I feel like a street dog, one man told the Los Angeles Times. Wet and cold and with no place to go. I didnt say this to the lonesome father, but its the reality: His sons have very little chance of settling lawfully in the United States if they are able to cross the border. Thats because theres no legal status for climate refugees. The rules that govern the rights of refugees were developed in the aftermath of World War II and during the early Cold War, when western countries like the United States had an interest in protecting people who were persecuted in the communist Soviet Union, Alexander Betts and Paul Collier write in Refuge: Rethinking Refugee Policy for a Changing World. Only a few specific groups were protected  those fleeing persecution because of their race, religion, nationality, political beliefs or social group. The 1951 UN refugee convention says people meeting those criteria should be able to seek asylum outside their home states. Other types of migration  including people seeking economic opportunity or those fleeing climate change  are not protected in a similarly codified way. Those people are typically not refugees in the legal sense. Theyre migrants. And if they cross borders, they may break national laws. Not everyone believes that should be so. Anote Tong, the former president of Kiribati, one of the small island nations in the Pacific, has advocated for what he calls migration with dignity  the opportunity for people from climate-affected areas to relocate if that makes their lives safer or gets them out of danger. Theres no harm in being prepared, he told me in an interview this fall. That idea runs against the current of nationalism sweeping the globe. From the United States to Hungary, Australia to Denmark, countries have been fortifying walls, filling detention centers and even detaining asylum seekers on castaway islands  not welcoming them. The United States is accepting far fewer refugees than it has in most years in recent memory. Attempting to add a climate refugee category in international law could pose problems of its own. Among them: How do you define who is and is not a climate refugee? Scientists are getting better at finding human fingerprints on heatwaves, droughts and storms that are being supercharged by global warming. But this is a realm of probabilities and complexities. Its difficult to say, with certainty, climate change made me move. Then there are political concerns, as well. Some scholars argue its politically dangerous to try to amend international refugee conventions because this is such an anti-refugee moment in history. The process could lead to refugee rights being stripped instead of added. Others contend that the UN refugee convention is so rarely followed that its almost irrelevant anyway, especially after the 2015 migrant crisis in Europe. If you were to create this whole new category and give people grounds to apply for asylum based on climate, youre likely to get an enormous number of people applying because its so ill-defined, said Steven Camarota, director of research at the conservative Center for Immigration Studies. How much below-average rainfall does the rainfall have to be in your region before youre a climate refugee? At present, the primary receiving countries already are experiencing tremendous resistance to the current level of asylees and refugees. It doesnt seem like resettling people in developed counties is going to be much of an answer to this problem. ... A much more effective use of resources is always to help people in place. Its also unclear that climate change is the main reason people are fleeing Central America, he said; the pull factors of wealth and opportunity in the United States may be more important. You can think of climate change as one of the push factors, he said, but it isnt the reason we get the caravan, per se. And its also important to understand if people were just starving, and they were desperately fleeing the total breakdown of the food chain, why travel 1,500 miles across Mexico to the US border? Mexico has lots of places you could stop to get basic sustenance. A 2018 report from the World Bank proposes two additional solutions. First, cut carbon emissions, which is the aim of the Paris Agreement. Second, help would-be migrants adapt to the warmer world. The international Green Climate Fund, which President Trump promised to walk away from, too, has approved projects to help farmers in Central America to become more productive, blunting the force of drought. USAID also has supported irrigation and farming projects in the region, according to a federal official. Combined, those two tools could reduce forced, internal displacement from climate change by about 80%, according to the World Banks Groundswell report on climate migration. Barring substantial changes, however, the scope of the migration crisis could be enormous. An estimated 17 million people in Latin America could be forced to relocate within their countries because of climate change by 2050 under the worst-case scenario, according to the World Bank report. Across three regions that the World Bank examined  which also included sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia  more than 143 million people could be forced to relocate because of global warming. That figure doesnt include extreme weather, such as hurricanes, which also are getting worse and tend to get more attention from the news media. The report only looks at slow onset climate disasters, from sea level rise to crop failures and water stress. In other words  events like the drought in Central America. The phone rang in the hilltop community. Delmi Amparo Hernandezs husband, German Ramirez, had left several days before, looking for the caravan, carrying with him a phone number in his pocket in case he could find a way to call the village. Shed been worried sick the entire time, scanning for his face on TV. The voice did not bring relief. Her husband was missing, the person said. Later, she would learn the worst had happened. Ramirez died on the road in Guatemala. The precise circumstances are unclear to her. Perhaps he was hit by a car while walking along the highway. Perhaps he was hitching a ride in a car that crashed. These are the stories people have relayed. What she knows for sure is that he died October 20 near Guatemala City. Cause of death: severe trauma. Authorities were able to bring his body back to the village; she is thankful for that. She buried him on the slope of a mountain above the town, in the same earth he used to till. She doesnt know what exactly will become of her family now. She hasnt been farming, hasnt been able to. The nonprofit World Vision has had to help with food. But when she looks at her youngest child, she finds hope. He is 3 years old  and named German, like his father, and grandfather, too. Will he farm this same land? I asked her. Yes, she told me. I imagine he will be just like his dad.",11/12/2018,https://edition.cnn.com/2018/12/11/politics/climate-caravan-honduras-sutter/index.html
One simple ?but really hard ?solution to stop climate change,"There may actually be a way to keep the worst of climate change at bay, but its going to take a herculean effort, according to a new study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications. Climate change is well underway already, the time to act and limit its human causes is now, many studies have shown. This latest report maps out what it may take to get there. It posits that if the world was to phase out its carbon-intensive infrastructure at the end of its design lifetime starting from the end of 2018, theres a 64% chance that the planets peak temperature can remain below the goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. Above that, scientists predict the planet will see even more extreme weather events such as wildfires, droughts, floods, massive animal die offs and food shortages for millions. The planet is already two-thirds of the way there, with global temperatures having warmed about 1 degree Celsius. To keep the global median temperature within this optimal 1.5 degree-Celsius limit, according to this study, change would have to happen across all sectors, not just in the energy sector. Power plants would need to be replaced, but so would gas and diesel-fueled cars, aircraft, ships and industrial plants. Even cows would have to go  essentially, anything that contributes to global warming. Under this scenario, infrastructure such as power plants wouldnt have to be scrapped and replaced with a non-carbon emitting technology  at least, not immediately. The researchers are talking about a design lifetime. In the case of power plants, the average lifetime based on historic data, is about 40 years. The average lifetime of a car on the road now is more than 11 years, according to Consumer Reports, but could last for about 200,000 miles, or 15 years, US estimates show. Once they wear out, stop working or die, theyd be replaced with technology or products that do not contribute to climate change. It seemed surprising at first that below 1.5 degrees Celsius could still be achieved with all the current infrastructure that is out there. It goes a little against conventional wisdom, said co-author Chris Smith, a research fellow at the Institute for Climate and Atmospheric Science in the School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds. But it actually makes sense in context of the remaining carbon budget  basically how much we can emit and still stay under this limit. Smiths study doesnt determine if this would be politically or economically feasible, but it does show dozens of scenarios that demonstrate the impact certain actions could have on the global mean temperature. The study shows time matters. If the world waits until 2030 to begin to eliminate its carbon-intensive infrastructure, the probability that the world can meet this 1.5 degree C goal is below 50%, even if the rate of fossil fuel retirement was accelerated. (The study is) motivation to continue aiming for a zero-carbon world not long after the middle of this century, Smith said of the research results. Limiting temperature rise reduces the risks of irreversible damages. He adds, the earlier we act, the less expensive the transition will be, and the lower the temperature rise is, the less climate-related damages will cost us. In October, a stark report from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said governments around the world must make rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society to avoid disastrous levels of global warming. It predicted the planet will reach the crucial threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius as early as 2030. The United Nations research shows that projected emissions of carbon dioxide from around the world is woefully short of the goals set in the Paris agreement. The current emission targets of all countries would end up creating an average global temperature rise of 3.2 degrees Celsius (5.8 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100, according to UN research. Emissions from the power sector, for example, have slowed down globally, although they were on the rise in the United States and that comes after a huge push for power plant development. A 2014 study showed there were more coal-fired power plants built in the decade before the study than in any previous decade. Last August, the Trump administration announced it would loosen restrictions on coal-fired plants. By the US Environmental Protection Agencys own estimate, the additional pollution will result in up to 1,400 more premature deaths a year as of 2030. The scenarios that we investigate in this study are really at the extreme optimistic end of what could be done without negative emissions or killing off power plants or cars before their time, Smith said. While the solution we propose is technically possible, it still doesnt look particularly likely. However, I would claim that mapping it out is a good starting point, and consistent with the definition of an infrastructure commitment. It would be interesting to see if, or how, some of these results change with perhaps more real-world assumptions.",15/01/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/01/15/health/climate-change-phase-out-infrastructure-study/index.html
"250,000 deaths a year from climate change is a ?onservative estimate,?research says","Climate change could halt and reverse progress made in human health over the last century. The grim analysis comes from one of the authors of a new report in the New England Journal of Medicine that suggests rising global temperatures could lead to many more deaths than the 250,000 a year the World Health Organization predicted just five years ago. In 2014 the WHO said that climate change will bring with it malaria, diarrhea, heat stress and malnutrition, killing that many more people annually around the world from 2030 to 2050. In reviewing the research on the topic, study co-author Sir Andrew Haines thinks our health is much more vulnerable to climate change  and he believes 250,000 deaths is a conservative estimate. We think the impact is more difficult to quantify because there is also population displacement and a range of additional factors like food production and crop yield, and the increase in heat that will limit labor productivity from farmers in tropical regions that wasnt taken into account among other factors, said Haines, a British epidemiologist and former director of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. Due to climate change-related food shortages alone, the world could see a net increase of 529,000 adult deaths by 2050, the report said. Climate change could force 100 million people into extreme poverty by 2030 and poverty makes people more vulnerable to health problems. Haines adds that climate change, while the most important environmental threat facing humanity, is not the only environmental problem that threatens our health. The depletion of freshwater resources, the unprecedented biodiversity loss, ocean acidification, overfishing, pollution, deforestation and the spread of invasive species, that are related to climate change, but are environmental problems on their own, all compound these public health threats he said. It is an urgent task to understand how to safeguard health in the face of these dramatic trends, all of which are caused by human activities related to patterns of economic activity. Haines added. An editorial accompanying the report urges medical professionals to take this report seriously. Its co-author, Dr. Caren Solomon, suggests doctors have a special responsibility to safeguard health and alleviate suffering, and that mission should include working quickly to curtail greenhouse gas emissions. We hope that this work will make more people aware and hopefully get more involved, said Solomon, a primary care physician who serves as deputy editor at the NEJM, and an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Womens Hospital. Her editorial points out that the health care sector accounts for nearly one-tenth of US greenhouse gas emissions and would rank seventh in the quantity of such emissions internationally, if it were its own country. Health care workers, she said, should encourage their organizations to reduce their carbon footprint. Reducing a health care facilitys carbon footprint is possible. She points to groups like Boston Medical Center, which generates its own energy efficient electricity and has climate-friendly programs like its hospital-based rooftop farm. Or the Gundersen Health System in Wisconsin that in 2014 became the first health care system in the country to produce more energy than it consumes, using wind, solar and methane from a local landfill. Solomon said physicians can also pressure politicians to create better climate change-oriented public policy and put pressure on groups to use financial divestment as a tool. In 2018, the American Medical Association and the Royal College of General Practitioners passed resolutions calling for divestment in fossil fuel companies. Doctors can also help educate patients and motivate people to act. There are substantial benefits and co-benefits of working to reduce these greenhouse gasses, said Solomon. Riding a bike to work or walking, rather than driving, for example cuts down on climate change-related pollution and the exercise is better for your health. Cleaner air also improves peoples health. We all know that prevention in medicine is enormously more effective and efficient, rather than waiting for full blown disease. We view climate change in the same manner and know that if we take action immediately, we can avoid the catastrophic health effects that are projected, Solomon said. Haines would agree. Future generations will, no doubt, look back at the missed opportunities for progress towards a healthy, sustainable economy and question why decisive action wasnt taken sooner, Haines said. It is imperative to increase the scale of ambition and emphasizing the potential health benefits of doing so now and for future generations could help to motivate progress.",16/01/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/01/16/health/climate-change-health-emergency-study/index.html
Climate is the biggest risk to business (and the world),"Companies and investors are waking up to the dangers posed by climate change and extreme weather. Many now consider environmental risks, such as droughts and wildfires, to be even more dangerous than turbulent markets, cyberattacks or geopolitical snafus. Climate and environmental issues dominate a ranking of top global risks produced by the World Economic Forum ahead of its annual summit in Davos. Business leaders and experts surveyed by WEF said that extreme weather, migration caused by climate change and natural disasters are the three risks theyre most likely to face in 2019. Each of the climate-related risks also ranks among the top five issues in terms of potential impact. There is more investor pressure and more requirements on companies, said John Drzik, president of global risk and digital at insurance broker Marsh. They have been already facing pressure from consumers to make their products more climate friendly, but the amplified investor pressure is new. Natural disasters and extreme weather caused around $160 billion worth of damage in 2018, according to reinsurance company Munich RE. Control Risks, a consultancy, predicts that figure will be surpassed in 2019. From storms to floods to droughts and forest fires, the costs of interrupted production, distribution, sales and travel will skyrocket in 2019, the group said in its annual risk report. Climate disasters point to several areas where businesses face increased risks. The first is supply chains. A report from University of Maryland and software firm Resilinc showed that global supply chain disruptions caused by weather doubled in 2017. The risk doesnt affect just the developing world, where infrastructure is often weaker. Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria combined that year to make the United States the most disrupted region for the first time. The most dramatic example of a company coming under pressure from risks related to the environment is Pacific Gas and Electric. The California utility company is facing billions of dollars in claims over the deadly 2018 Camp Fire, and it said earlier this week that it would file for bankruptcy on January 29. The company cited at least $7 billion in claims from the Camp Fire, which caused 86 deaths and destroyed 14,000 homes. It is believed the fire was started when a PG&E power line came in contact with nearby trees. In the bankruptcy filing, the company cited the significant increase in wildfire risk resulting from climate change as one of the reasons for its decision. We simply wouldnt be seeing the catastrophic weather events weve witnessed in recent years if not for the amplifying effect of climate change, said Michael Mann, director of the Penn State Earth System Science Center. Top investors are demanding that more companies draw up environmental action plans. Theyre also asking CEOs to consider risks to their business caused by shifting consumer attitudes toward climate change. Alison Martin, the chief risk officer at Zurich Insurance Group, said it doesnt matter whether the companys leadership believes in climate change or [what they think] the causes of it are. If you were a plastic straws manufacturer a few years ago thinking about your strategy going forward, maybe you werent anticipating that consumer sentiment could so quickly and so radically move against you, she said. Shareholders are becoming increasingly vocal. Norways $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund launched a big push for sustainability in September, saying it will be using its power as the worlds biggest stock holder to influence companies to behave more responsibly. Last month, investors managing assets worth $32 trillion called on businesses to step up efforts to tackle climate change. In a landmark climate report last year, the United Nations last year called for rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society. It warned the world has only 12 years to avert a climate disaster. Drzik said the UN timeline made companies wake up to the urgency. View of risks tends to be dominated by the short-term horizon, and climate is still seen as more long-term than geopolitical risk ... but that report has started to pull more focus on it, he said. Maersk (AMKBY), the worlds biggest shipping company, recently said its aiming to be carbon neutral by 2050 and urged other shipping companies to do the same. Last month, Shell became the first energy company to link executive pay and carbon emissions.",16/01/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/01/16/business/climate-change-global-risk-wef-davos/index.html
The climate change winners and losers in Antarctica? animal kingdom,"Climate change creates many losers on this planet, but there could be a few winners in the animal kingdom, too, according to a new study in Thursdays Frontiers in Marine Science. The polar oceans are currently amongst the most rapidly changing environments on Earth, because of the ongoing and future threat of climate change. Thats bad news for many of the animals that live there and have evolved specifically to live in conditions that have been relatively constant for 4 million years. In that time period, glaciers have brought the most stress and change to habitat there; now, the biggest change agent is climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions, ozone-depleting chemicals, the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide, the increase in wind and the warmer temperatures have all significantly altered the Southern Ocean, also known as the Antarctic Ocean. Theres been a rapid decline of sea ice and ice shelves are collapsing. The glaciers are retreating. The sea is rising and warming, and is experiencing acidification. Krill, some clams, and humpback whales will be some of the biggest losers in the Antarctic region, the study said. The emperor penguin, the Adelie penguin and the Chinstrap penguin face bleak futures, too. But starfish, sea squirt and a variety of worms will benefit from climate change, according to the new study. The southern right whale and king penguins that feed on fish will likely gain the most from the decline in sea ice and will have more room to breed as the glaciers retreat. Many of the animal losers, like certain breed of penguins, feed through sea ice, give birth on the sea ice, and use it to rest. Animals like the humpback whale that depend on food sources like the massive stocks of threatened krill are expected to do badly with climate change. With climate change there is a real urgency in our need to understand the impact of these changes on these animals, said co-author Simon Morley, a scientist based at the British Antarctic Survey in the UK. Morley and his co-authors figured out who wins and loses, he said, by essentially taking the same approach researchers would use if they created an occupational health survey to look for risks in a workplace. Except, in this case, the workers wear feathers, scales or fur and theyre not the type to complain about the temperature in their office. This approach has limitations, Morley said, because data is limited and the ecosystem is complex, so there could be problems for even the winners when this complex environment changes. But, he said, the work should give scientists a good baseline. We know the Earth is warming. We know humans are the major factor behind why global climate is changing so fast. We know that the rate of change in global climate is faster than the Earth has experienced in the last million years. In the face of this, we need to understand the vulnerabilities of animals and plants to climate change, Morley said. How will life fare in the long term? Well, we need more data on more species.",17/01/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/01/17/world/climate-change-animal-winners-losers-study/index.html
Climate change: Do you know the basics?,"Climate change: its a subject you cant avoid, and youre only going to hear more about it as the world continues to feel the heat. Maybe youve watched documentaries about cute endangered polar animals or tried to read complicated scientific journals about wildfires, rising ocean levels or fossil fuels. The causes of climate change are everywhere, from the clothes you wear to the burger you eat  but do you actually understand the basics? At CNN, we recently analyzed the most searched climate change questions on Google Trends; the results revealed that many people are still looking for fundamental answers. Weve put together this list to help you learn more about our changing climate. The term, climate change is used to describe a long-term change in global temperatures and weather patterns. The earths temperature has changed drastically in its 4.5 billion year history, from the Huronian Ice Age that covered vast portions of the planet in ice for nearly 300 million years, to a period about 50 million years ago, when scientists believe that palm trees and crocodiles were native above the Arctic Circle. Today, climate change is commonly used as a term to describe the effects of global warming that have occurred as a result of human activity following the industrial revolution in the 18th century. This is where it gets a little complicated. Earths atmosphere is full of gases. Some gases, including nitrogen and oxygen  that together accounts for 99% of the gas in the atmosphere do not absorb heat from the sun, allowing it to reflect back into space from the Earths surface. Other gases, known as greenhouse gases  including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide  absorb heat and make up roughly 0.1% of the atmosphere. When these gases absorb solar energy, they radiate it back towards the planets surface and to other gas molecules, creating the greenhouse effect. The greenhouse effect plays an important role in naturally regulating the temperature of our climate. Without it the Earths average temperature would -18C. Thats roughly the temperature of a domestic freezer. Since the industrial revolution the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has been increasing as a result of human activities like burning fossil fuels, deforestation and modern farming practices. Which means more greenhouse effect, and more heating. A 2013 report by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a UN body of climate scientists, found that the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration had risen by 40% since the industrial revolution, resulting in earths temperature increasing by 1C. The impact of climate change depends on how much the earth warms. In 2018, the IPCC released a stark report on the effects of a 1.5C temperature increase. These include more extreme weather conditions, sea-level rising, the destruction of coastal ecosystems, loss of vital species and crops, population displacement and a huge cost to the global economy. In 2018, the United Nations warned that without urgent action global temperatures are set to rise above 3C above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century. At that temperature the outlook begins to look even worse  Entire cities could be swallowed by the rising oceans, species of plants and animals face extinction as their ecological systems fail to adapt to the heat, and hundreds of millions of people could be forced to migrate due to coastal flooding, longer-lasting draughts and depleting crop yields. Almost everyone now accepts that the global climate is changing. The biggest public debate  fueled by high-profile climate skeptics like US President Donald Trump  is around whether climate change is being caused by human activity. But various studies have shown that a vast majority of scientists agree climate change is real and caused by humans, with one finding that 97% of the worlds scientists agree that human-caused global warming is happening. In 2014, 1,300 scientists from around the world contributed to a UN (IPCC) report on the scientific knowledge of climate change. Their report said there was a 95% chance that human activity in the past 50 years had directly resulted in increasing the temperature of the earth. Physical proof of global warming has been found across the globe, from glacial retreat high in the Himalayas, to coral bleaching in our oceans, to the regularity of extreme weather patterns. But there is hope. Climate change can be limited and halted but only if we take what the IPCC describes as rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society. To do this, two things need to happen. Firstly, we need to reverse 250 years of bad environmental habits. In December 2015, 195 countries agreed to a legally binding framework  The Paris Agreement  to achieve zero net carbon pollution by the end of the century. The immediate challenge is to slow down and limit global warming to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels. A key aspect of this is to limit the human practices that create greenhouse gas emissions. That will mean changes to many aspects of our daily lives  from our diets, to the way we travel and how we produce the products we all buy. The second, big challenge is reversing the effect of those practices by reducing the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) that is already in the atmosphere. There have been advances on this front, ranging from hi-tech carbon capture technologies, to simply planting more trees. But as of yet the IPCC has categorized the technology as unproven at a large enough scale to move the needle.",18/01/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/01/18/health/climate-change-google-questions-answered/index.html
"Climate change will affect gender ratio among newborns, scientists say","Global warming will have a variety of effects on our planet, yet it may also directly impact our human biology, research suggests. Specifically, climate change could alter the proportion of male and female newborns, with more boys born in places where temperatures rise and fewer boys born in places with other environmental changes, such as drought or wildfire caused by global warming. A recent study in Japan found a link between temperature fluctuations and a lower male-to-female sex ratio at birth, with conceptions of boys especially vulnerable to external stress factors, wrote Dr. Misao Fukuda, lead study author and founder of the M&K Health Institute in Hyogo. Last summer, Fukuda and his colleagues published a separate study looking at births in areas hit by environmental events that caused extreme stress. They included Hyogo Prefecture after the Kobe earthquake of 1995; Tohoku after the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011 (and subsequent nuclear disaster at the Fukushima Daichii power plant); and Kumamoto Prefecture after the 2016 earthquakes. Nine months after these disasters, the proportion of male babies born in these prefectures declined by between 6% and 14% from the previous year. This data supports the idea that major stress affects gestation, which in turn alters the newborn sex ratio, Fukuda and his co-authors wrote. Stress stemming directly from climate events caused by global warming might also affect the sex ratio, Fukuda wrote in an email. Though scientists do not know how stress affects gestation, Fukuda theorizes that the vulnerability of Y-bearing sperm cells, male embryos and/or male fetuses to stress is why subtle significant changes in sex ratios occur. Scientists believe that the sex ratio is equal at conception, explained Steven Orzack, president and senior research scientist of the Fresh Pond Research Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts. But more than half of all human conceptions die during gestation, and this results in a sex imbalance at birth. Overall, more females die during pregnancy than do males. So thats why theres an excess number of males at birth, said Orzack, who has published research on this issue. Ray Catalano, a professor in the school of public health at the University of California, Berkeley, explained that the process of natural selection in utero is why deaths occur during gestation. A mothers biology spontaneously aborts some conceptions in utero but not others. The factors that filter out who gets through from conception to birth include chromosomal or genetic abnormalities of the fetus or the mothers stress response to changes in her environment, Catalano said. Because the ovaries of a female fetus carry all the eggs she will ever possess, the possibility of genetic defects being found in a female (and her eggs, which represent her potential children) are greater than the possibility of defects in a male fetus, which carries only his own genes. Worldwide, the newborn sex ratio averages 103 to 106 males born for every 100 females, Catalano explained. In part, this is a result of the fact that a male infant are a relatively frail organism, he said. For every society, for every year, the human being most likely to die [prematurely] is male infants. And thats true for every society that we have data for, Catalano said. The reasons why are not understood, but some scientists believe that boys are biologically weaker and more susceptible to diseases and premature death. The general theory as to why the sex ratio is not equal at birth is that if you want the sex ratio to be 50:50 by reproductive age, you want a few more males than females at birth because more males than females will probably die in early childhood, Catalano said. What Catalano found when studying populations of Danes, Finns, Norwegians and Swedes born between 1878 and 1914 is that colder years meant fewer males born. Yet years of fewer males meant hardier baby boys, who were less likely to die in infancy, he found. These boys grew into men who had a larger-than-expected number of children. This is evidence of selection in utero at work, he said. Effects of global warming will also shape the selection process in utero, Catalano said. The Earth is undergoing a process of rapid change. If you start to change the environment relatively quickly  within 100, 150 years; in evolutionary time, thats a blink of the eye  what that means is that youre going to change the environment in which human gestations occur, Catalano said. Add to that the fact that climate change models dont just predict that Earth will become warmer. What they predict is that things will get less predictable, he said: Well have greater swings of temperatures with higher highs, lower lows and faster oscillations between the two extremes. Extreme weather and subsequent environmental effects, such as droughts, will probably lead to human stress. That stress is likely to affect the birth sex ratio, and there will then be human adaptation  the natural evolutionary response, Catalano said. When you change the climate the way were changing it, you will change, profoundly, the characteristics of the population. Samuli Helle, a senior researcher in the Section of Ecology, Department of Biology at the University of Turku in Finland, also found that warmer temperatures bring sons. In his study of the Sami people of Northern Finland, he was also able to quantify the effect: For every 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) rise in temperature, there was a 0.06% increase in the ratio of newborn boys compared with girls. For example, he said, an annual increase of 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) would translate to a 0.18% higher ratio of male-to-female newborns. Not a dramatic influence at first sight but it should be remembered that in large populations such effect size might mean thousands of extra boys annually, Helle wrote in an email. Helle also said events caused by global warming, such as forest fires and floods, might also impact the sex ratio, though the scale would not necessarily be global. Such influences are more likely to be local, since the climate is warming up differently in different parts of the world. Likewise, environmental hazards are also likely to have spatially rather limited influences on human reproduction, he wrote. Helle said there are also, potentially, several factors that influence the human birth sex ratio (and in both directions), so he doesnt expect to see global scale effects just due to climate change in the near future. Orzack does not believe theres enough evidence to definitively state that climate change affects the newborn sex ratio. There is a trend in a number of countries towards a less male-biased sex ratio at birth. Orzack said, though he does not know whether this trend is a direct consequence of global climate change. However, this trend may be due to the effects of pollution, he said, and this may be a secondary consequence of global climate change. Fukuda believes that any potential effects of climate change on the newborn sex ratio may not be uniform around the globe. It may depend on different environmental factors of each place, he wrote. Extremely hot or cold weather most markedly influenced the birth sex ratio, while more moderate shifts did not always show an effect. Weak or strong, any effects probably would not be long-lasting, Fukuda said. His earthquake study found that the newborn sex ratio returned to normal within a few months. The Kobe earthquake took one month, Tohoku earthquake two months, and Kumamoto one month, he said. Ultimately, for Fukuda, the importance of the newborn sex ratio is less societal, more medical. The importance of the newborn sex ratio is as a sensitive reproductive health indicator, he said. Extreme temperature fluctuation affects birth weight. Catalanos concern, though, is evolution. Humans are incredibly adaptable, we got through the Great Ice Age, he said, so he has no fears that we will adapt to climate change. What will we be after that adaption? We will be different, he said. Climate change is going to change the characteristics of the population in ways that maybe cant be anticipated.",23/01/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/01/23/health/climate-change-infant-sex-ratio-intl/index.html
?eel the fear? Climate change is now the talk of Davos,"Has business finally woken up to the enormous challenges posed by climate change? This years World Economic Forum provides some hope. Climate was a major theme in Davos, where panel discussions on everything from global warming to ocean sustainability and biodiversity drew large crowds. Naturalist and broadcaster David Attenborough was given top billing and primatologist Jane Goodall appeared on a panel. A dinner hosted by climate and environmental groups was one of the hottest tickets of the week. The focus on climate reflects developments that have been hard to miss even for profit-obsessed CEOs. Damaging storms have in recent years resulted in major financial losses and a California utility company has been brought to its knees by billions of dollars in claims related to wildfires. Companies have also seen how easy it is for their reputations to be tarnished over environmental issues  and how easy it can be to change. Things change instantly because of the power of social media, Burberry (BBRYF) board member Orna Ni-Chionna said during a panel discussion in Davos. Ni-Chionna knows what shes talking about. Burberry was caught in a PR firestorm when it emerged last year that unsold clothes were being destroyed. When this was discovered, the social media theme that rocketed to the top was Burberry burns. It took me about five minutes to send an email to our chief executive and ... it took our chief executive three weeks to have a completely new policy, she said. Talk is well and good, but there was widespread recognition in Davos that real change wont happen without action. For experts here, that means corporate and government policy reforms. Many speakers acknowledged progress wont be made until the economics change. There are still fossil fuel subsidies from G7 countries  thats ridiculous, said Rachel Kyte, special representative of the UN Secretary-General for Sustainable Energy. Why we are subsidizing something we know is killing our children, poisoning them and affecting their ability to learn? Thats beyond me, she added. There were new initiatives too. Procter & Gamble (PG), PepsiCo (PEP), Nestle (NSRGY) and Unilever (UL) joined forces with waste management company TerraCycle to launch Loop, a project that will allow people to reuse containers for some of the worlds most popular household products. The spirit of the event was reflected in two attendees with little in common: One is a former vice president of the United States; the other a 16-year-old Swedish schoolgirl. What Al Gore and Greta Thunberg share is anger at corporate executives who arent moving quickly enough to address climate change. I dont want you to be hopeful, I want you to panic, I want you to feel the fear I feel every day, Thunberg told attendees. Gore participated in a friendly panel discussion with David Attenborough on Tuesday, where he warned that politicians are in denial about environmental risks. The former Democratic presidential candidate was downright fired up by the end of the week. On Thursday, he stood before a room packed with CEOs and climate change experts and warned that humanitys survival is at stake. Who is with me? he yelled into the microphone as the crowd roared their approval. The question everyone was asking: what will follow that roar?",25/01/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/01/25/business/climate-change-davos/index.html
"Climate change: The more we know, the worse it seems","To get a full grasp of climate change, you need to take a geological perspective. Wind the clock back all the way through human history, past the Romans and through the Stone Age, to the time before modern humans evolved, and our ape ancestors roamed in Africa. Roughly three million years ago, in an epoch called the Pliocene, was the last time carbon dioxide levels were as high in the atmosphere as they are now. In other words, todays CO2 concentrations  at about 410 parts per million  are higher than at any time during the existence of Homo sapiens. Sea levels were as much as 30 meters higher than now, suggesting that even todays carbon dioxide levels will be enough to eventually (albeit over many centuries) melt so much ice from the polar regions that all major coastal cities will be drowned. But its the rate of change that is really off the charts, even geologically. Humans are now transferring 10 billion tonnes of carbon from the earths crust  in the form of combusted coal, oil and gas  into the atmosphere each year. This is a rate of carbon release probably 10 times faster than anything scientists can find in the geological record for the past 300 million years, including cataclysmic volcanic eruptions that are linked with several of the mass extinctions of life that have occurred during that time. So its perhaps hardly surprising that each new climate-related news headline seems to be worse than the last. Just recently scientists announced that the oceans are warming much faster than they had previously thought. The amount of heat now being absorbed in the seas equates to the energy generated by exploding at least three Hiroshima-sized atomic bombs in the oceans every second, according to a calculation by The Guardian. No wonder the coral reefs are dying  also at a rate that is much more rapid than anyone previously thought. When I wrote my 2007 book Six Degrees, looking at the predicted degree-by-degree impacts of climate change, it was expected that reefs would be undergoing regular bleaching events in about 2030. Sadly, its already happening. More than 90 percent of the Great Barrier Reef was affected by coral bleaching just over two years ago  the devastation was so severe that the marine scientists surveying the aerial data wept. I am currently working on an updated edition of Six Degrees. Its a scary task because many of the impacts that I had previously put in later chapters  equating to three or more degrees of global warming  have had to be moved forwards, because they are happening already. Another example is the worsening of climate extremes, like hurricanes. In 2007 I imagined a monster storm, worsened by global warming, hitting Houston in about 2040. Well that happened already too  in 2017 Hurricane Harvey poured so much water on the Houston area that it equated to the flow of Niagara Falls for 110 days. Scientists later calculated that Harveys rainfall was likely intensified by as much as a third because of the changing climate, in particular the warming oceans which act as rocket fuel for tropical cyclones. The flooding from hurricanes is often aggravated by storm surges, which are worsened in turn by rising sea levels. There is news here too: this week scientists announced that the melt rate in Antarctica has increased six-fold since the 1980s, which contributes to sea-level rise. Greenlands melt rate has also shot up, increasing four-fold between 2003 and 2013. This week scientists announced that the giant northern polar ice sheet has likely already crossed a tipping point of irreversible decline. Recent Greenland melt rates are now without precedent for hundreds, and probably many thousands, of years. Interactive: Greenlands melting glaciers may someday flood your city When I wrote Six Degrees back in 2007 I felt that there was at least an odds-on chance of stabilizing global temperatures at or below 2 degrees Celsius, the policy target that was later agreed by world leaders at the Paris climate conference in 2015. This now looks deluded. Achieving the two-degrees target would require the whole world to cut its net carbon emissions to zero by mid-century, and to go carbon-negative  somehow hoovering up hundreds of billions of tonnes of extra carbon dioxide using technology yet to be invented  from the atmosphere for decades thereafter. In the real world, the opposite is happening. Emissions reached a new record last year, dragging us ever closer to the worst-case scenarios employed by climate models, which yield four degrees or more by the end of this century. Perhaps the scariest thing of all is that millions of people  including the President of the United States  are still climate skeptics. For them, conspiracy theories and mass psychological denial serve to justify business as usual. It is customary to end articles like this with an optimistic call to arms, a rousing finale making that case that it is not yet too late to act to avoid the worst if only we scale up zero-carbon technologies fast enough to urgently cut emissions. But that risks letting us off the hook. Instead, consider this. There is no known geological precedent, for at least the last half-billion years of the history of life on earth, for climate change of the magnitude now projected this century to take place over such a short period of time. To think that young people alive today will experience all of this within their lifetimes is an extraordinary thought indeed.",26/01/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/01/25/opinions/climate-change-getting-worse-intl/index.html
"To fix climate change, fix the obesity and starvation epidemics, reports say","The world needs to come up with solutions to fight three interrelated pandemics  obesity, starvation and climate change  and it needs to do it fast before the planet is burning, according to a report released Sunday in the Lancet. The Lancet Commission, a group of 43 experts from 14 countries with a broad range of expertise recruited by the journal, has tackled the topic with high-profile reports in 2011 and 2015, but little progress has been made other than acknowledging the epidemic, the authors of the newest report argue; in fact, the problem is getting worse. Around the world, not one country has reversed its obesity epidemic, and often, powerful companies driven by profit influence policy that is at odds with the public good and planetary health, the report says. Its a problem that has become what the authors call a global syndemic. A syndemic is a synergy of pandemics that co-occur, interact and share common causes. These three pandemics represent the paramount challenge for humans, the environment and our planet. Together, obesity and malnutrition are the biggest cause of premature death. Globally, more than 2 billion adults and children are overweight or obese and have health problems because of it, research shows. People dont or cant exercise, and thats the fourth leading risk factor for death. Simultaneously, the opposite problem exists. In 2017, world hunger increased for the third consecutive year, UN research shows. Two billion struggle with micronutrient deficiencies, and 815 million are chronically undernourished, the report says. As global temperatures rise even faster than predicted, climate change could lead to many more deaths than the 250,000 a year the World Health Organization predicted just five years ago. Because of food shortages alone, the world could see a net increase of 529,000 adult deaths by 2050, according to research. The new reports suggest that there is a solution: Governments, companies and activists should tackle these obesity and undernutrition issues while tackling climate change. Each problem is related, and each, in large part, happens because of misplaced economic incentives, powerful vested interests, policy inertia and insufficient demand for change from the public. Solutions that help one could help the other. For example, if governments invest more in public transportation, that will make it more convenient and affordable for people to get to jobs that put food on the table. Those who drive less and take public transportation more often get more exercise and, studies show, tend not to be obese. If fewer people drove cars, there would also be less greenhouse gas to contribute to climate change. The reports other recommendations include reducing government subsidies for beef, dairy, sugar, corn, rice and wheat and redirecting that money to sustainable farming for healthier foods. Strengthening laws that increase transparency would let people see how much money politicians get from large food conglomerates to perpetuate unhealthy policies. Another suggestion: providing clear nutrition labels on products and adding labels to explain how sustainable a food is, including how much water and carbon it took to make it. Also, the authors recommend investing $70 billion over 10 years in a global Food Fund to reduce undernutrition. The authors also say philanthropists should invest an additional $1 billion to boost social advocacy to demand solutions to these syndemics. These syndemics need to be tackled, and they have not been tackled, and this is a core concern, said report co-author Tim Lobstein, policy director at the World Obesity Federation. The authors say businesses could help lead the way, such as by investing more in sustainable energy. Such investment reduces the pollution that causes climate change and makes the air easier to breathe, meaning people can exercise outside more. The Lancet Commission Report may just contain the right ingredients needed for a nutritionally challenged world, said Katie Dain, CEO of the Non Communicable Diseases Alliance global partnership, who was not involved in the report. For too long, we have been daydreaming our way to a diseased future, one that is totally avoidable. The reports interconnected message on nutrition and climate change is clear: A food system that secures a better diet for this and the immediate next generations will save millions of lives and, at the same time, also help save the planet. The authors hope the new report will start a conversation that creates alliances to push for better policies and encourage companies to create affordable products that would improve, rather than take away from, peoples health. What we have now is unsustainable, and we must act, said report co-author William H. Dietz, director of the Sumner M. Redstone Global Center for Prevention and Wellness and a professor at George Washington University. Otherwise, the planet could be burning within 50 years. Corinna Hawkes, a professor at City University London who worked on the report, notes, No question it is highly aspirational, given todays world. But Dietz added that urgent solutions are necessary. We are running out of time.",27/01/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/01/27/health/obesity-climate-change-undernutrition/index.html
The great irony of climate change politics is red states face more pain,"Climate change will impose the greatest economic losses on Republican-leaning areas of the country that are almost uniformly resisting new efforts to combat it, according to a sweeping new study released Tuesday. In the study, researchers at the Brookings Institutions Metropolitan Policy Program found that states, counties and congressional districts that voted Republican in 2016 and 2018 will suffer greater economic and environmental damages from a changing climate over the coming decades than places that voted Democratic in the past two elections. As a share of income, rural areas that now break predominantly for the GOP will likewise suffer greater losses than the metropolitan centers that have become the backbone of the Democratic coalition. These findings show how continued disruption in the environment might scramble the geographic alignment of the climate debate. Today, Republicans elected from the states that emit the highest levels of greenhouse gases have coalesced into what Ive called a seemingly impregnable brown barricade against federal legislation to reduce the carbon emissions linked to climate change. Republicans hold 35 of the 40 Senate seats from the 20 states that emit the most carbon per dollar of economic output, according to figures from the federal Energy Information Administration; in 2016, President Donald Trump won 26 of the 27 highest-emitting states. But these new results raise the possibility that some states that now see action against climate change as an economic threat may increasingly view inaction as the greater danger. That could poke holes in the brown barricade. Drill down on the political geography of climate damage and it becomes clear that in much of the country Republicans are voting for people who are opposed to climate policy even as they are most exposed to climate impacts, write David G. Victor, Mark Muro and Jacob Whiton, the authors of the report. On the other hand, some of the Mountain and Great Plains states that now emit the most carbon may benefit economically from a warming climate, the study found. That raises the ironic prospect that the states contributing the most to climate damages elsewhere may grow even more resistant to action because the shifting weather patterns may improve their own long-term economic prospects. The Brookings study tracked these dynamics by using a county-level model of the impact of climate change developed by the Climate Impact Lab, a consortium that includes scientists and economists from several institutions, including the University of California at Berkeley, the University of Chicago and Rutgers University. The model incorporates such factors as potential losses from rising sea levels, the impact on agricultural yields and changing mortality rates to project how much economic harm climate change will impose on each county through the end of the century, in the period from 2080 to 2099. Though projections that distant are inherently subject to uncertainty, Victor says there are two reasons for confidence in the forecasts. One is that these impacts are based on good physical understanding of the underlying causal mechanisms, he wrote in an email. We know a lot about how strong wind and high tides affects coastal areas, about how heat stress affects workers, etc. Second, this is not a single analysis, but a meta-analysis. It is a compilation of the best science in the area. Putting both together give one a lot more confidence in the projections. The Brookings analysis of the Climate Impact Labs results for American counties produced a clear pattern: The red places most opposed to green activism are the most exposed to economic and environmental risks from a changing climate. The study found that Trump carried nine of the top 10, and 16 of the top 20, states projected to suffer the most economic damage from a changing climate over the coming decades. Counties that voted for Trump in 2016 are projected to face significantly greater economic losses in the coming decades than those that voted for Clinton  nearly 5% for the Trump counties, compared with just over 3% for the Clinton counties. And congressional districts that Republicans carried in 2018 likewise are projected to endure significantly greater long-term economic losses (4.4%) than those that voted for Democrats (2.7%). These contrasts are largely driven by the regional imbalance in the long-term impact of climate change. The study finds that states across the nations southern half, especially in the Gulf region from Florida through Texas, face the greatest risk of overall losses, coastal damage and increased mortality rates from a changing climate. These are states now dominated by Republicans. The eight states that the study projects will face the largest economic damages from climate change run from east to west across the Sun Belt from South Carolina, Georgia and Florida through Alabama and Mississippi to Louisiana, Arkansas and Texas. Trump won all eight of those states and Republicans now control all 16 of their Senate seats. So far, theres no evidence that concern about climate has become a decisive political factor in those states. Most pointedly, voters in Florida and Texas last fall elected climate skeptics Rick Scott and Ted Cruz, respectively, to the Senate over Democratic opponents who called for aggressive actions to reduce the risk. But Muro, a senior fellow at the Metropolitan Policy Program, says continued climate-related damage could tilt that balance over time. Wave after wave of hurricanes coming into central Texas or the Gulf states may be destabilizing of the usual assumed ideological position of those places, he says. Three other states across the Sun Belt  North Carolina, Oklahoma and Arizona  also rank in the top 15 states at greatest risk for losses, Brookings found. Trump won each of those and Republicans hold all of their Senate seats except for one in Arizona, which Democrat Kyrsten Sinema captured last fall. (Sinema has called for action on climate change, but did not stress the issue.) The study also found that while the absolute economic losses will be greatest in metropolitan centers  almost all of which now lean toward Democrats  the damages will represent a greater share of total per capita income in rural places that Republicans now rely upon. Rural areas suffer less in absolute terms but have much lower incomes, so the percentage hit is greater, Muro says. This is consistent with the intuition in most research on climate impacts  that poor places are more vulnerable and, while they lose less in absolute terms, they have even less they can afford to lose. For all these reasons, the authors conclude: The current gridlock might not be as permanent as it now seems because many of the jurisdictions that have selected political leaders opposed to climate policy are most exposed to the harms of climate change. But in most of the high-risk states the prospect of future damages from climate change must contend politically with the reality of current economic benefits. Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Texas and South Carolina  each projected for big climate-related losses in the study  all rank among the 20 states that today emit the most carbon per dollar of economic activity, according to the Energy Information Administration data. Most high emission states either produce a substantial amount of fossil fuels or rely on cheap coal-generated electricity to power robust manufacturing sectors. Over time, support for action against climate change may grow faster in high-risk states that are not as reliant on the fossil fuel economy, a list headlined by Florida, Georgia and North Carolina. Florida may prove especially pivotal over time, the Brookings authors believe. Heavily exposed to the danger of increased coastal damage, it exceeds all other states in the expected economic losses through the remainder of this century. It is home to fully seven of the 10 metropolitan areas across the country that the study expects to endure the greatest damages from climate change, led by Lakeland-Winter Haven, Tampa-St. Petersburg and Cape Coral-Fort Meyers; Miami-Fort Lauderdale ranks 10th on the list. You do have to think about Florida, says Muro. Is it less stable (in its resistance to climate action) than Texas? Victor, the studys co-author, believes that in the high-risk states with a big investment in the fossil fuel economy, growing awareness of climate danger may translate into calls for policies of adaptation, rather than acceptance of efforts to reduce carbon emissions. Republicans from those states have uniformly backed Trump as hes moved to rescind the regulations from former President Barack Obama limiting carbon emissions from power plants and increasing automotive fuel economy, and to withdraw US from the Paris treaty limiting global emissions. It may be easier for conservatives from those states to advance policies, such as seawalls, to offset the danger of rising sea levels and more intense hurricanes. The politics of adaptation and emission control are very different, says Victor, a professor of international relations at the UC San Diego and a senior fellow at Brookings. One of the studys most striking projections is that 19 states, all across the nations northern half, will experience at least some net economic benefits from the changing climate. These states will benefit mostly because climate change will mean longer growing seasons, fewer intense cold snaps and also because higher levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increase yields for some crops. These 19 states include 11 that voted for Clinton over Trump, and all three of the blue wall states that Trump peeled away after they had voted Democratic in at least the previous six consecutive presidential elections: Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. There is certainly an irony here that the blue coalition by and large appears more oriented to policy actions and responses that in fact will benefit other parts of the country, even as they benefit the world, says Muro. But the list of potential beneficiaries from a changing climate also includes Wyoming, North Dakota, Montana, Alaska and Idaho, all reliably Republican states. Each of those, except for Idaho, is a major energy producer that ranks among the seven states that emit the most carbon for every dollar of economic output. That juxtaposition creates a different irony: Several of the states contributing the most to carbon emissions  and voting most reliably for politicians opposed to reducing them  may also benefit from the changes those emissions trigger. Still, the larger pattern is that Sun Belt states across the nations southern tier that now underpin Republican strength in the Electoral College, the House and the Senate are on the front line for economic and environmental losses from future changes in the climate. In the coming years, the American climate debate may turn on whether growing evidence of harm dislodges many, or any, of those states from the brown barricade now blocking any federal efforts to confront the challenge.",29/01/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/01/29/politics/climate-change-irony-brookings/index.html
"China? greenhouse gas emissions rising, undermining Xi? climate push","Chinese methane emissions are rising at an alarming rate despite recent government regulations aimed at curbing the climate-changing pollutant, a new report has revealed. A study released in the journal Nature on Tuesday shows a steady growth in Chinas methane emissions, primarily from the countrys massive coal mining sector, undermining Beijings claims to be leading the world on climate change action. Methane emissions in China appear to be increasing, business as usual. We were unable to detect any impact of regulations on the countrys methane emissions, the reports lead researcher Scot M. Miller told CNN. China is among the worlds largest emitters of methane. While methane is less prevalent in the earths atmosphere than carbon dioxide, it traps 28 times more heat according to the Global Carbon Project. In 2010 the Chinese government enacted a series of new polices requiring methane from coal mining to be captured, or to be converted into carbon dioxide. But scientists found that the policies had failed to curb overall emissions. Using data from Japanese satellites collected between 2010 and 2010, the study found Chinas annual methane emissions increased by 50% for at least five years after government regulations were passed in 2010. The jump is equivalent to the total emissions of other large nations such as Russia and Brazil. China has had great ambitions for capturing that methane and using it for electricity production or heating buildings, but what we found is that theres little evidence that theyve been able to meet those ambitions, Miller told CNN. China is the worlds largest producer and consumer of coal. The countrys continued reliance on the fossil fuel has come under increased scrutiny in recent years. President Xi Jinping has placed a huge emphasis on tackling pollution and greenhouse gas emissions in his second term in office, making it one of his three battles in 2017. State-run media has been making a big show of broadcasting punishments against officials caught violating environmental laws, with 32 people detained in November after inspections of ten provinces. In fact, following US President Donald Trumps decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate Change agreement in 2017, questions were raised over whether Beijing was now the leading nation on tackling climate change. Asked about Chinas climate change commitments in November, Xie Zhenhua, Chinas climate change special envoy, said it was the countrys responsibility to deliver on their promises to protect humanity and the earth. By the end of 2017, Chinas carbon intensity had already fallen by 46%, meaning that it has achieved its goal three years ahead of schedule. Renewable energy already accounts for 13.8% of primary energy consumption and will surely meet the goal of 15% by 2020, Xie said. Miller conceded that his research only extended to 2015, meaning that stricter regulations enforced by Xi may yet to be reflected in the data. In terms of methane, Chinas emissions are so much larger than any other country that anything they could do to mitigate their emissions could have a substantial impact on overall methane levels in the atmosphere, he said.",30/01/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/01/30/asia/china-coal-emissions-climate-change-intl/index.html
"BP will link bonuses for 36,000 workers to climate targets","BP has pledged to align its business more closely with global climate goals and link the bonuses of 36,000 employees to greenhouse gas reduction targets. The company said Friday that it would support a resolution from activist investors that calls on BP to align its goals with the 2015 Paris Agreement, which aims to keep global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius. The resolution is from Climate Action 100+, a group of 300 investors with $32 trillion in assets. It will be voted on at the companys annual meeting in May. The group writes in the resolution that action was needed because BP has not yet demonstrated that its strategy is consistent with the Paris goals. The resolution includes specific pledges. BP (BP) will consider whether new investments are consistent with the Paris deal. That includes exploration projects, acquisitions, technological investments and the development of existing oil and gas fields. The company will set climate targets related to its own operations, and it will publish an annual review of its progress. BP also said that 36,000 of its workers will see their bonuses linked to greenhouse gas emissions reductions. The resolution is the latest example of companies facing increased scrutiny from shareholders over climate change. Shell (RDSA), for example, said last year that it would start linking executive pay to short-term carbon emissions targets in 2020 after coming under pressure from shareholders including the Church of England. Climate Action 100+ said the BP resolution was good news for both investors and the planet. Yet other activist investors may not be satisfied. BP will face a second, tougher, climate change resolution at its annual meeting. This one is spearheaded by Follow This, a Dutch activist shareholder group that previously targeted Shell. Follow This is asking BP to set and publish climate targets related to its own operations. But it also wants the company to account for emissions generated by the oil and gas products that it sells. BP has said that while it is prioritizing making its fuels more efficient for its customers, it cannot commit to targets that go beyond its own operations. In additional to BP, Follow This has announced plans to file similar resolutions against energy companies including Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX).",01/02/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/02/01/business/bp-shareholders-paris/index.html
Climate change denier among those appointed to EPA science board,"The Environmental Protection Agency appointed several new members to its Science Advisory Board who have denied key findings of the harmful effects of man-made pollutants on the environment and human health. The appointments by acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler come following the former coal lobbyist and Republican Senate aides confirmation hearing last month for him to assume the role permanently. Wheeler said at the hearing that he would not call (climate change) the greatest crisis, adding that he considers it a huge issue that has to be addressed globally. One of the newly appointed board members is Dr. John Christy, a professor at University of Alabama in Huntsville whos a known climate change denier. I see neither the developing catastrophe nor the smoking gun proving that human activity is to blame for most of the warming we see, Christy wrote in a 2007 Wall Street Journal op-ed when he was on the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a co-recipient of that years Nobel Peace Prize. In the op-ed, Christy accused colleagues projecting century-long weather patterns of having overstated-confidence and warned of jump-to-conclusions advocates and, unfortunately, some scientists who see in every weather anomaly the specter of a global-warming apocalypse.

"Climate change will even change the color of the oceans, study says","The ocean will not look the same color in the future. It wont turn pink or anything radically different; the change will be more apparent through optic sensors than though the human eye. But it serves as an early warning sign that global warming is significantly altering the planets ecosystems, according to a new study. Essentially, climate change will make the blues of the ocean bluer and the greens greener. Scientists figured this out by creating a global model that simulates the growth of a tiny creature that lives in the oceans and affects the color we see. Their research was published Monday in the journal Nature Communications. The ocean looks blue or green to us because of a combination of how sunlight interacts with water molecules and with whatever else lives in that water. The molecules in water absorb all but the blue part of the spectrum of sunlight, and the water reflects that blue color back. Thats the color we see. The water looks greener when it has more phytoplankton, tiny, microscopic organisms that, like plants, can use chlorophyll to capture mostly the blue portions of the spectrum of sunlight. They then use photosynthesis to create the chemical energy they need to live. When there are more of these creatures in the water absorbing sunlight, they make the water look greener. Conversely, if there are fewer phytoplankton, the water looks bluer. The creatures growth is dependent on how much sunlight, carbon dioxide and nutrients are around. Climate change is altering the ocean currents, meaning there will be fewer nutrients for phytoplankton to feed on in some areas, so there will be a decline in their number in those regions. Since the 1990s, satellites have taken regular measurements of how much chlorophyll is in the ocean. Those levels can change because of weather events or because of climate change. But using those images to look at reflected light alone, the researchers in the new study could distinguish what is specifically due to climate change. And they noticed that there will be a significant shift in the color of the oceans much earlier than was previously predicted, just looking at chlorophyll changes. The study predicts that the blues will intensify, most likely in subtropical regions where phytoplankton will decrease. These are areas near the equator like Bermuda and the Bahamas that are already quite low in phytoplankton. Regions where there are a lot of nutrients, like in the Southern Ocean or parts of the North Atlantic, will see even faster-growing phytoplankton because those waters are warming with climate change. Those waters will look greener. Climate change will bring a color change to half of the worlds oceans by the end of the 21st century, the study says. Thats bad for climate change on several levels: For one, phytoplankton remove about as much carbon dioxide from the air as plants and help regulate our climate, research shows. They are also key to other animals survival. The change is not a good thing, since it will definitely impact the rest of the food web, said study co-author Stephanie Dutkiewicz, a principal research scientist in MITs Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences. Phytoplankton are at the base, and if the base changes, it endangers everything else along the food web, going far enough to the polar bears or tuna or just about anything that you want to eat or love to see in pictures.",04/02/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/02/04/world/climate-change-ocean-color-study/index.html
Cli-fi (climate fiction) on the big screen changes minds about real climate change,"A record number of Americans, 7 out of 10, believe that climate change is real, and the majority understand that human activity is largely to blame, according to a January poll. But still leaves 30% who are skeptical, and there are still key politicians like President Donald Trump who regularly tweet their doubts. Rather than lobby them with more facts, perhaps climate scientists should send naysayers to the movies. Ever since the 1973 cult classic Soylent Green introduced audiences to the food shortages climate change will bring, movie makers and television show producers have been scaring people about it. Apple TV will run a TV series called Losing Earth this year, and TNT will turn the movie Snowpiercer into a TV series. (Like CNN, TNT is part of WarnerMedia.) Theres even a catchy name for this climate change fiction genre: cli-fi. What experts tell us, though, is that cli-fi isnt just wholesome dystopian entertainment; it seems to help people believe in actual climate change, even when Hollywoods version of the science is a bit off. Story is one of the oldest and most powerful forms of communications we ever had. When someone says now, let me tell you a story ... something goes zzzzzt in your brain. Its like when you were a child and your parent says they are going to tell you a bedtime story. It automatically opens you up,  said Anthony Leiserowitz, a senior research scientist at the Yale University School of Forestry & Environmental Studies and director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. Film, so far, is the most powerful form of storytelling that weve devised, Leiserowitz said. Leiserowitz has the data to prove it, although because people dont always listen to facts, he has a good story about it, too. Once upon a time, back in 2004, there was a blockbuster called The Day After Tomorrow, starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Dennis Quaid. Its about a polar explorer who warns the world that the Gulf Stream will shut down. It does, triggering dramatic weather events, including a new ice age. It was based on a short-term variation in ocean circulation that was in the news at the time, said another climate change expert, Jim Fleming. Some of my apocalyptically oriented colleagues loved it, and one, a polar explorer, was even a model for the main character. I could not suspend disbelief, however. While the science made it hard for some experts to enjoy, like a lot of sci-fi, the film goes beyond the science, another climate expert, Jonathan Overpeck, wrote in an email. He explains that although the ocean circulation can slow, change wouldnt happen overnight, and its unlikely to spark a new ice age. Rather, it means less warming in the North Atlantic, like what we see now. Overpeck, who is a paleoclimatologist and a dad, adds that its a personal favorite since its main character is a paleoclimatologist dad who speaks truth to power. The kind of global freeze-up depicted in the film is not something to worry about, Overpeck said. But paleoclimatologists do rock! Leiserowitz likes the movie. He did a study about how it motivated people to take action to curb climate change, and artists from all disciplines have reached out to him to talk about how to create equally impactful narratives. Before The Day After Tomorrow even opened, there was buzz or, as Leiserowitz punnily describes in his 2005 study, an intense storm of media controversy. Scientists and politicians took to the airwaves, debating the movies accuracy and impact. Some feared that the drama would make people think climate change was mere fantasy. Others worried that the public would panic and force politicians to fight climate change, something unwelcome by the Republican White House at the time. Leiserowitz and his team studied its impact in real time. They created a national survey, sampling public opinion a week before the movies release and four weeks later. What they found was that across the board, the movie appears to have had a strong influence on watchers risk perceptions of global warming. Most moviegoers didnt worry that the most extreme scenario, like what happened in the movie, would happen in real life, but those who saw it, compared with those who skipped, felt more inclined to make personal changes to reduce their carbon footprint. They were more inclined to talk to friends about climate change, and seeing the film affected voter preferences. Leiserowitz has a theory about why the movie mattered. You cant directly experience global warming. Its a theory. Its abstract. Scientists have collected temperatures and data from many decades all over the world, and that gets communicated to you through the analytic brain. Thats important, yes, but the movie, its a story. Our ancestors relied on story to survive, he said. For example, if you see some berries that look delicious, but someone in your clan told you about a guy who ate one and died, even if you have never tasted one, that story teaches you to avoid them. They are dangerous. Some other studies about the film showed that motivation to act didnt last, and not all climate change experts love the cli-fi genre. Katharine Hayhoe, an atmospheric scientist and professor of political science at Texas Tech University, said in an email that she appreciates that these movies bring attention to climate change, but she tends to avoid them, since seeing the science over-dramatised and misrepresented can be incredibly frustrating for me as a scientist. I feel that when it is so dramatic, people instinctively know, oh that cant be true, and so that leads them to reject what we actually do know, wrote Hayhoe, director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech. Some studies show that the apocryphal nature of many of the films turns people off to some of the messages. Hayhoes grad student Sydney Laws, on the other hand, wrote her final project about cli-fi. I personally dont think we should hold our collective breath for a film that gets all of the facts correct, Laws writes. Filmmakers have to tell a story in order to get the audience engaged, so I prefer to focus on their effectiveness at compelling moviegoers to change their behavior. So while scientific accuracy is incredibly important for the publics understanding of the ins and outs of climate change, merit can still be found in even the most outrageous of movies. Overpeck, climate scientist and dean of University of Michigans School for Environment and Sustainability, said a surprisingly novel and scientifically credible premise led him to watch another cli-fi classic, the 2013 film Snowpiercer. Its about a rogue billionaire who has used climate engineering to cool the planet, but the experiment goes awry, creating a snowball Earth that is largely frozen solid, and the only survivors ride a train filled with class warfare that forever circles the globe. A growing debate exists within the climate science community about the utility of geoengineering to cool the planet back down while at the same time continuing to burn fossil fuels and emitting greenhouse gases that act to warm the planet, Overpeck wrote in an email. One critical aspect of this debate, however, is that we may never know enough to geoengineer safely. The Earth has experienced such frozen conditions millions of years ago, and thus climate science indicates it can be done. And, as in the movie, a snowball Earth eventually would start to thaw, Overpeck said. But the technological mistake is unlikely. Instead, the potential for other mistakes more deeply trouble climate scientists, for example triggering severe droughts and famines in sensitive parts of the planet, Overpeck said. Creating technology to cool the planet does not get rid of fossil fuels that he said will continue to acidify the oceans, endangering life. Bottom line, the potential for geoengineering the planets climate, complete with inherent likelihood of mistakes, is already moving from science fiction to reality, Overpeck said. But, most climate scientists feel it would make more sense, and be safer, to just move beyond fossil fuel burning, and create a more sustainable planet. Fleming, one of the worlds better-known history of science experts that focuses on climate change, said Snowpiercer was a free airplane flick. He watched it, ironically, on his way home from a geoengineering conference where I had lecture on the insanity of planetary intervention. He found the class conflict and the revolution on the train interesting, as (spoiler alert) was the ending. Two survivors of the inevitable train wreck (both people of color) seem to foreshadow a new beginning and a hopeful future, Fleming, the Charles A. Dana professor of science, technology and society at Colby College, wrote in an email. Yet a hungry polar bear looks down on them. The film ends suddenly before the polar bear has his dinner. The scenario in the 2015 film Mad Max: Fury Road may be more likely, scientists said. Its another post-apocalyptic film depicting a planet ravaged by climate change and ecological collapse. This film, intentionally or not, hits home accurately with climate science and one of the big under-appreciated impacts of climate change and human-folly, said Overpeck. In the movie, fresh ground water is gone. In our world, water supplies are threatened. The world of Mad Max has more of a scientific foundation  at least when it comes to dry-land water sustainability  than many might think, Overpeck said. And the emphasis on gas-powered cars and trucks strike a real irony  to the end, humans rely on the very fossil fuel that has destroyed their world. Worth a watch. In most cli-fi, our future doesnt look so bright, but there is one film in the genre that experts like so much theyll see it with their kids. Disneys 2008 animated film WALL-E features the last robot on Earth, left to tidy up the pollution humans left behind when they left the uninhabitable plant. The scenario does seem plausible, scientists said. Unmitigated climate change and pollution interacts and endangers life, and that is well-supported by science, Overpeck said. But, the other key message of WALL-E is that there is hope. The planet Earth has been ravaged before (think asteroid impacts), and it has recovered. Climate change could indeed cause the next planetary mass-extinction, but millions of years further on, life would again flourish on the planet; science supports this premise as well. A planet largely destroyed by unchecked climate change and pollution is possible, but do we really want to envision living in space as a viable solution when instead all we have to do is move beyond fossil fuels and use available knowledge to chart a more sustainable future for our planet? Overpeck said. More than worth a watch, kids or not.",08/02/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/02/08/world/climate-change-movies-eprise/index.html
"With climate change, what will your city? weather feel like in 60 years?","Within your child or grandchilds lifetime, the weather may be dramatically different because of climate change. The past five years have already been the hottest on record for our planet, but based on new projections published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications, its going to get a lot hotter for the 250 million people living in North American cities. In many urban areas, the researchers from the University of Maryland, North Carolina State University and the National History Museum of Denmark at the University of Copenhagen found substantial differences between probable future climate and even the best scenario. That means that by 2080, many cities will probably experience novel climates with no modern equivalent. According to the researchers interactive map, if emissions are not cut and climate change continues as it is, by 2080, summers in New York will feel like those of Jonesboro, Arkansas: an average 9.1 degrees Fahrenheit warmer and 20.8% drier. If we cut emissions and enact policies that tackle climate change, the change wont be nearly as extreme. By 2080, summers in New York would feel more like those of Lake Shore, Maryland: about 4.4 degrees warmer and 9% drier. Nearly all cities in the eastern United States, including Boston, Philadelphia and Washington, would have climates much more similar to those of cities hundreds of miles away to the south and southwest. Its not just the East Coast that could change. The Northeast would be more like the humid parts of the Midwest or southeastern United States. Western cities would be more like the desert Southwest. Cities in Florida would experience summers more like what parts of Mexico has today. San Francisco would have the climate of Los Angeles: 7 degrees warmer and 40% drier. The change could be particularly problematic in the West, where the study shows that the average distance between cities future climate and current climate analogs might be shorter. Changes in elevation show just how drastically different the climate could be in the future. Take Denver, elevation 5,280 feet: The Mile-High City is known for its comfortable mountain climate and it depends on tourism featuring winter sports like skiing. But by 2080, according to the study, Denvers climate would be around 9 degrees Fahrenheit warmer and more like that of the Texas Panhandle city of Borger, elevation 3,077 feet. Climate change planning is well underway in Denver, according to Tom Herrod, a program lead with the Department of Public Health & Environment. The city has a goal to reduce carbon emissions 80% from 2005 levels by 2050. Denver also has done its own climate modeling to create a climate action plan, and the numbers in the new study look similar to those results, Herrod said. City officials use data sets like these to look at how they should improve building codes and to make sure they arent just energy-efficient but have the proper air quality inside. Its really about adaptation planning and getting as much of the city prepared as possible, Herrod said. Not a lot of Denver residents have air conditioning, but if the citys climate becomes like Texas, that will need to change, and residents will need to prepare. We love seeing studies like these because its a really good way to bring climate change in front of people, Herrod said. This really will impact people in their daily lives. Kristie Ebi said more cities are going to be proactive and think about climate change and its impact on infrastructure. Buildings in Chicago are built for cold, for example, not heat. There are so many places without central air, and it is not cheap to put in and not cheap to run, and thats just the start of planning that will need to happen, said Ebi, who was not involved with the new study but who looks at the impact of climate change on health as a professor at the University of Washingtons Department of Global Health. Temperature changes will do more than make summers extremely uncomfortable for people who are used to milder temperatures. The changes will hurt economies and affect such industries as farming and tourism. Ebi said city health departments need to be thinking about increases in vector-borne diseases, heat-related deaths, allergies and asthma. Worker productivity will fall for those who work outside, and Little League teams will have to change their seasons to avoid the higher temperature. This impacts a lot of lives in lots of ways  and ways people may not be thinking of with these shifts, Ebi said. Mapping like this is really helpful because it helps people understand how much their own cities will have to adapt. Urban populations are considered highly sensitive to climate change, the study said. Because most people live in cities, the authors wanted to show people what climate change could mean for them in a real and concrete way. Lynda Walsh, a professor at the University of Nevada, Reno who has written about impactful ways of communicating about climate change, said she likes this approach. This approach doesnt sentence its viewers to climate doom; rather, theyre invited to envision a city they have heard of and perhaps even have visited, Walsh said in an email. This approach has the potential to spark conversation and creative what if we...  responses, rather than hopeless resignation to a global scenario thats beyond any one communitys control. Walsh said the authors are right to point out that the climate-analog approach needs further testing to see if this form of communication works, but, Walsh said, to a rhetorician of climate, at least, who cares most about promoting democratic deliberation and policymaking around the issue, (the researchers) analogical approach is really promising. The good news is, these are projections. Adverse consequence doesnt necessarily have to occur if we take action, University of Washingtons Ebi said. She cites the time when Mothers Against Drunk Driving became a popular group advocating for changes in drunken driving laws. A small group of very angry mothers changed all the laws in the United States, Ebi said. It is possible to make rapid change in short periods of time. We need the collective action and individual action and change. This is possible.",12/02/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/02/12/health/climate-change-cities-projected-temperatures-study/index.html
New urgency on climate change comes to Congress,"While President Donald Trump pokes fun at global warming on Twitter and expresses doubts about his own administrations scientific findings about climate change, Congress is approaching the issue with new urgency. Now in the majority in the House, Democrats held multiple committee hearings over the past two weeks to discuss climate science and hear the accounts of people who experienced climate change destruction. Throughout the hearings, leading climate scientists discussed the damage already done to public lands. They warned about rising temperatures, the threats of sea level rise, floods, the loss of sea ice and the intensification and frequency of extreme weather events like hurricanes. One of the scientists who testified was Robert Kopp, a co-author of the National Climate Assessment released in November. At nearly 2,000 pages, it is a data-driven and peer-reviewed assessment of climate change and its predicted impact. The process of drafting the fourth National Climate Assessment are painstaking and complex, but its fundamental findings are simple and urgent. First, climate change is real, its happening now, and humans are responsible for it, testified Kopp, director of the Rutgers Institute of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences and a professor in Rutgers Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences. The planet is running a fever. On February 6, governors from Massachusetts and North Carolina testified before the House Natural Resources Committee, discussing the billions of dollars in damage and loss of life, property and jobs in their states due to extreme weather events related to climate change. Many federal initiatives are only available after a disaster occurs, Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker testified. He urged Congress to make more funds available to improve infrastructure and research and to set targets for emission reductions that can vary by state. In Massachusetts, climate change is not a partisan issue. While we sometimes disagree on specific policies, we understand the science and know the impacts are real because we are experience them firsthand, said Baker, a Republican. On Tuesday, at a House Subcommittee for Indigenous People of the United States hearing, community leaders testified about how climate change has forced entire villages to move. Jennine Jordan, the government relations liaison for Calista Corp., a regional Alaska Native corporation, cited Newtok. Its one of the six villages the state of Alaska has labeled in peril due to climate change. Newtok is currently threatened by advancing erosion caused by the Ninglick River, adjacent to the village, Jordan said. This progressive erosion, plus permafrost degradation and seasonal storm flooding, threaten the very existence of Newtok. It will cost the community $130 million to move to a new site 9 miles away, Jordan said, because no roads connect the areas, and there is already a critical housing shortage forcing multiple families to share single homes. Some federal disaster funds are off-limits, because while federal legislation like the Stafford Act allows for funds to cover damage caused by singular events like earthquakes and hurricanes, it does not help in the case of slow-moving disasters caused by climate change, she said. At Tuesdays hearing of the House Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources, community leaders talked about the need for government funds to get coal workers and others in boom and bust extraction industries into other work. Peter Hille, president of the Mountain Association for Community Economic Development in Berea, Kentucky, testified that the areas long history of coal mining did not create prosperity and has left an economy that has been distressed for generations. It was made worse in 2012, when natural gas became cheaper than coal, collapsing that industry. A return to coal is not the answer, he said. Instead, his organization provides small-business loans and energy efficiency programs and helps retrain miners for green jobs in sustainable agriculture, energy efficiency work and others. These communities fuel the growth of this great nation, he said. They are owed a debt and need new investment. Bill Bisset, a minority witness who is president and CEO of the Huntington Regional Chamber of Commerce, talked about recent job growth in West Virginia thats largely due to the rebirth in coal and natural gas production, he said. Its a campaign promise from the Trump administration but one that analysts say is unsustainable. Bisset urged the committee to continue to support all forms of energy production and said businesses in West Virginia are worried about the boom being fragile. Any action due to climate change fears could damage our economy far greater than any other state, he said. Democrat and Republican members of Congress also took the opportunity to talk about the the current politics around climate change. Democrats complained loudly about the Trump administration. Though the administration has regrettably chosen to ignore the findings of its own scientists in regards to climate change, we as lawmakers have a responsibility to protect the publics interest, House Science, Space and Technology Committee Chairwoman Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-Texas, said Wednesday. Rep. Deb Haaland, D-New Mexico, who chaired Wednesdays Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands hearing, said, they see fit to pursue energy dominance at all costs to push a destructive and extractive agenda. Calling climate change the most pressing issue facing our nation, Haaland said that national parks are warming twice as fast as the rest of the country. Climate change threatens our coasts and jeopardizes the countrys clean air and water, and at the same time, the (Trump) administration has suppressed science and prevented adaptation, she said. They put Americans in harms way, Haaland said. If this administration will not take the lead, this committee will. Republicans, while expressing interest in pragmatic solutions to climate change, also criticized progressive proposals like the Green New Deal, which Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar labeled at Tuesdays hearing a socialist fairy tale. All too often, this issue has been used as a vehicle to push a radically progressive agenda that would prove to be devastating for American families and would offer minimal, at best, climate results, Republican Rep. John Curtis said, reading ranking member Don Youngs statement at Wednesdays hearing on public lands. (The Alaska Republican came late to the hearing.) Among the policy goals that have been expressed would be complete elimination of air travel, cows and nuclear energy, the statement said. Fear mongering and unrealistic rhetoric should have no place in this debate. Instead, we should focus on pragmatic solutions that offer realistic environmental solutions. At the Science, Space and Technology hearing Wednesday, Johnson said that her hearing on climate change will be the first in what will be multiple climate change-related hearings this Congress. It is clear that we are responsible for our planet warming at an alarming rate, and we already are feeling the impacts of this warming today, she said. These hearings will allow us to better understand the climate-related impacts we are experiencing in all of our districts.",13/02/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/02/13/health/climate-change-hearings-congress/index.html
"Fueled by climate change, Zimbabwe? erratic harvests cause farmers with HIV to struggle","Jemitias Denhere shakes his head as he explains why, despite being a specialist in soil management and crop production, he specializes in beef livestock. The district agronomist  plants specialist  owns 27 hectares of land in the Mwenezi area of southern Zimbabwe, a particularly arid location. Here, farmers endure extreme weather challenges such as drought and flash flooding  and, thus, some of the highest food shortages. His cattle can exist on the little grass that remains during dry times, but to produce crops without irrigation is risky  so he decided against it. One year, you win; one year, you will fail; repeat, he said. But over the past five years, the situation has become worse. One of the rising uncertainties climate change is bringing to the country: The rains have come much later, with the November rainy season beginning as late as January  and when it comes, theres less of it, sometimes falling for just one day. Were experiencing the worst style of drought. If we receive rains, it will be like a cyclone: very violent, too windy. Very erratic. So you cannot bank on it. Things are changing every day. As a result, maize, the staple diet of rural Zimbabweans, can no longer be counted on with traditional farming methods. Denhere, a university-educated professional who has trained in Brazil and China, is one of the lucky ones, with a salary as the district agronomist and 25 cattle. But about 80% of Zimbabwes population  rising to 90% in this area  are subsistence farmers, meaning they rely on rain-fed agriculture to feed themselves and their families. Life as a farmer in Zimbabwe is tough, with lack of water, poor sanitation and little food. Its common to have only one or two meals a day of sadza, a porridge dish. Extreme weather is adding to the problem, with most agreeing that conditions are very different from 20 or 30 years ago. Tadios Chikuko, 44, began farming as a boy and inherited his parents land in the small village of Mharadze in Mwenezi district, about 100 miles from the South African border. He says the weather started to change dramatically in 2000. Traditionally, he has grown maize in the red clay soil, on one field around his compound and another 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) away. But hes had to diversify to feed his family of four sons and two daughters, aged between 9 and 22, as well as his wife and sister-in-law. He now plants small grains such as sorghum and finger millet, as well as velvet beans because they are naturally more resistant to drought and have shorter seasons, so there is less risk if a whole harvest is lost. Previously, we could rely on the weather. Now, we are gambling on the rainfall. Food shortages are already acute. The Zimbabwean government estimates that more than 2.4 million people in rural areas will face acute food insecurity at the peak of the current lean season of January to March. Overall rainfall has declined nearly 5% across Zimbabwe during the past century, according to a report on climate change from the Zimbabwean government and the United Nations Development Programme last year. It describes the climate changes as threefold: Not only is there less rain, but it now rains at a different time of the year and in different areas. Its erratic. In Mwenezi, people have also reported heavy hailstorms and strong winds that have destroyed crops. Its clear that people are feeling increased uncertainty about the weather, said Maarten van Aalst, director of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, which advises the Red Cross globally. But he adds that while its known that climate change is bringing more heat and rising risk of drought to this area, there is no clear scientific evidence about changes in hail or strong winds  mainly because researchers dont have the data. Separate from these climate changes is the weather phenomenon El Nino, a fluctuation in the climate system that warms the sea surface temperature in the Pacific. In 2015-16, this caused a drought in Zimbabwe, followed by flooding. Staple crops such as maize were wiped out, and more than 2.8 million people were left in need of food aid, with then-President Robert Mugabe declaring a state of disaster. Petteri Taalas, secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organization, says another El Nino is now likely, and although it wont be as bad as four years ago, it will still have considerable impacts such as higher-than-normal temperatures and a more prolonged dry spell. But the consequences of such extreme weather go even further, beyond livelihoods, hunger and education, to the populations health  including HIV. Restaurant owner Musa Sibanda, 56, a volunteer with the Zimbabwean Red Cross, says she commonly sees people living with HIV who have complications after harvest failures because the lack of food affects the effectiveness of their treatment. They may take the pills without food and feel ill, or perhaps they dont take the pills at all, with fatal consequences, she said. Patients need to be well-nourished to take the medication, but they rely on a good harvest to feed themselves, District Medical Officer Dr. Itai Matibiri explained. If they dont have enough food, their already-vulnerable bodies will not respond as well, and they may experience side effects such as nausea and stomach upset, he said. Zimbabwe has the fifth-highest HIV rate in the world after eSwatini (formerly Swaziland), Lesotho, Botswana and South Africa, with a 13.3% prevalence among 15- to 49-year-olds, according to UNAIDS data. An estimated 1.3 million people were living with the virus in 2017, with 41,000 new cases that year, the organization estimates. Reported access to antiretroviral therapy in Zimbabwe is relatively high at 84%, and treatment is free. But adherence is a big issue. Without their medication, their viral load  the number of HIV viruses in the bloodstream  increases, said Miatibiri, who is one of just two doctors working out of Mwenezi District Hospital in Neshuro, which covers a population of 202,000 across an area of 5,000 square miles. In addition, when they dont have food to sell, they cant pay for transport to pick up their medicine, he said. Tarisai Mubhoyi, 43, who lost her husband to AIDS in 2008, admits that she has skipped her HIV pills to avoid the side effects on occasions when she has had no food. When she does have food, its often a simple dish of sadza porridge and dried vegetable relish. When I take my medication without food, I feel very weak with stomach pains. I ask myself, is the medicine being rejected by my body, or is my body falling ill again? she said. The mother of five maintains her two-field smallholder farm in Mwenezi district while struggling with night sweats, severe headaches and weakness because of her HIV. Last year, when a hailstorm destroyed her maize crop as it was flowering, she often had just one meal a day and at times went without food completely in order to feed her children. To get enough food without the rains is close to impossible, she said. Drought and resulting issues around food security were also shown in a recent study to affect rates of new HIV infections. The research by Columbia University, the Lesotho Ministry of Health and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that adolescent girls exposed to severe drought conditions in rural Lesotho had higher rates of HIV. They were also more likely to engage in high-risk behaviors, including sex work, and were more likely to drop out of school. Climate extremes are often associated with changes in behavior as people struggle to survive in the face of loss of agricultural production., wrote lead author Andrea Low, assistant professor of epidemiology at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University. As people, particularly women, address their food insecurity, they may be less likely to take steps to protect themselves from HIV infection. Today, Mubhoyi has a regular supply of tomatoes, okra and spinach after Red Cross volunteers showed her how to establish a keyhole garden outside her front door. This 2-meter-wide circular raised garden, with a composting hole in the center, uses household wastewater to grow nutritious vegetables. With money from selling tomatoes, shes been able to buy schoolbooks and stationery for her children. Its easy to maintain and does not need much labor. Were having better meals at more regular intervals. She has also planted her two fields with drought-resistant varieties of short-season crops such as ground nut and millet to maximize her chances of a good yield. Mubhoyi is adamant that she will take her HIV medication, made easier by produce from her garden. If I didnt take the medicine, I dont want to find out what would happen. Meanwhile, Chikuko has the opportunity to learn climate-smart agriculture techniques at the Red Cross Farming Centre of Excellence at Neshuro, 2 miles from the district hospital, by experts like Denhere, the district agronomist. Hes been taught about mulching, to trap moisture into the soil, as well as using short-season varieties that ripen in two months instead of six, giving him more reliable produce. In two years, hes had remarkable results. Last year, he planted two fields with maize, one in the traditional way and one using his new skills. The difference couldnt be clearer: While many shoots in the traditional field are just starting to poke through the earth, the climate-smart maize has ripened and is a foot higher. And due to diversifying away from maize in the past couple of years, Chikuko has also been able to sell 10 to 15 kilograms of velvet beans beyond what he needed for his family and income. As a result, he has been able to build an extra room on his house and pay all of his childrens school fees. Chikuko is one of 200 lead farmers teaching these new ways in the Mwenezi district under a community resilience program run by a partnership of the Zimbabwe and British Red Cross that could have a huge impact on the triple challenge of climate change, food security and HIV. No matter (if) you get small rainfall, you are going to get a better yield than with the old systems, he said.",13/02/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/02/13/health/climate-change-zimbabwe-farmers-hiv-intl/index.html
Fighting climate change may be easier than we think,"With the plethora of dispiriting reports on climate change  we recently learned, for instance, that our oceans are warming at least 40% faster than the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change originally thought  many elected officials have taken up the mantle of fighting global warming. The Green New Deal, spearheaded by New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts, has garnered attention for its ambitious goal of completely shifting to renewable and zero-emission energy over a decade. Given these research findings and calls for aggressive plans of action, it can be hard to feel at all positive about current efforts to address climate change. But there is good news. The progress we have made to replace coal and gas as our primary energy sources has already begun to take control of some of the greatest contributors of greenhouse gas emissions. What is even more remarkable is we are doing it at little to no increase to the cost of power, according to my calculations. Take the United States as an example. Wind and solar power are now on average the least expensive ways of generating electricity. In some locations, wind and solar energy prices are as little as one-third the cost of coal. Even without including the contribution of coal to global warming, it is simply no longer a cost-effective energy source. Wind and solar are now economically sounder investments. But what about the unreliability of renewable energy sources by comparison? The United States is working on that, too. Power from windy or sunny days can now be stored in batteries, which has been a tremendous contributing factor to the reduction in the price of renewable energy sources. In addition, there is hydropower, which is renewable, and nuclear energy, which is carbon-free. Both sources are not intermittent, meaning they can be relied upon for constant power, and can complement battery storage and provide backup to renewables. As the Green New Deal gains steam, there is also further hope for an even more concerted economic transition to clean energy jobs and infrastructure. The increasing sophistication of electric car technology is another mitigating factor. Indeed, several forecasters expect the majority of new cars to be electric by 2040. The two remaining sources of greenhouse gas emissions  space, water and industrial process heating, and agriculture  could prove challenging, but if there is a will, there is a way. Meat replacements are now available in many supermarkets, and their widespread adoption will reduce agricultures contribution to changing the climate. So how much would it actually cost the United States to replace all fossil fuels as the Green New Deal recommends? Not nearly as much as you might think. I estimate it would take a gross investment in renewable power plants, extra grid capacity, and storage capacity of about $3.3 trillion over the next 20-30 years (US GDP is about $20 trillion). But the cost is not really all chargeable to the transition to renewables. All our coal plants are old and will have to be replaced well before 2050. This is also true of many of our gas and nuclear plants, regardless of the movement to go carbon-free. That would offset the cost associated with transitioning by about $1 trillion. In the process of transitioning to a clean energy economy, we would also progressively eliminate the huge cost of fuel, an additional savings of about $1 trillion, by my calculation. Putting those figures in context, after factoring in miscellaneous savings, we are only looking at adding an approximate $1.1 trillion to go carbon-free by 2050 on top of what were already spending on outmoded forms of energy generation. That breaks down to $34.4 billion per year for the next 32 years  less than 0.2% of the current GDP. Right now, the United States is spending roughly $50 billion per year on infrastructure for power generation and the grid. So, we do not have to spend more, we just have to spend smarter. Green New Deal proponents suggest we aim to become carbon-free within a decade or so. Given the sheer volume of investment needed, this is implausible: Midcentury seems the earliest we could reasonably expect to approach this goal. Of course, climate change is not just a US problem but a global one. My numbers relate to the United States, but the same analysis applies to most countries. Indeed, many other industrial nations are making more rapid progress toward decarbonization than we are. Fossil fuels are less expensive in the United States than most other countries because we produce so much and tax them so lightly  so if renewables are competitive here, they will certainly be competitive with carbon fuels elsewhere, too. While we still have quite a way to go, we have begun the journey to a stable climate and a more sustainable economy where we can generate all the electric power we need without fossil fuels. And it may cost less than continuing on our current path.",13/02/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/02/12/opinions/climate-change-opinion-heal/index.html
Washington Post: Climate skeptic may lead WH panel to study climate change and national security,"A climate change skeptic who once compared demonization of carbon dioxide to the treatment of Jews under Adolf Hitler may lead a proposed White House committee tasked with studying whether climate change poses a national security threat, The Washington Post reported Wednesday. The Post, citing planning documents obtained by the paper, reported that William Happer, a National Security Council official, would head up the proposed Presidential Committee on Climate Security. The committee would be created via an executive order signed by President Donald Trump, according to the paper. The White House declined a request for comment. In 2014, Happer, who co-founded the CO2 Coalition, an advocacy group that focuses on the consequences of mandated reductions in CO2 emissions, compared criticism of carbon dioxide, the increase of which scientists say has raised global temperatures, to the treatment of Jews under Hitler. The demonization of carbon dioxide is just like the demonization of the poor Jews under Hitler, Happer said on CNBC. Carbon dioxide is actually a benefit to the world, and so were the Jews. Happer, an atomic physicist at Princeton, also said in 2016 that he prefers to refer to the group as the CO2 anti-defamation league...because there is the CO2 molecule, and it has undergone decade after decade of abuse, for no reason, according to the Post. Happer did not immediately respond to CNNs request for comment. The Posts report comes a few weeks after top intelligence officials laid out in a report the potential security challenges posed by climate change, including threats to public health, historic levels of human displacement, assaults on religious freedom, and the negative effects of environmental degradation. That reports assertion is at odds with positions of the President, who before taking office claimed climate change was a hoax. Last month, in a tweet that was largely seen as mocking global warming, Trump commented on extremely cold temperatures in the Midwest, writing, What the hell is going on with Global Warming? Please come back fast, we need you! The Post reported that the documents it obtained indicated the committee would serve to advise the President on scientific understanding of todays climate, how the climate might change in the future under natural and human influences, and how a changing climate could affect the security of the United States. The paper also said that the documents add that although the Trump administration has said previously that climate change is a threat, these scientific and national security judgments have not undergone a rigorous independent and adversarial scientific peer review to examine the certainties and uncertainties of climate science, as well as implications for national security.",20/02/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/02/20/politics/white-house-climate-panel-william-happer/index.html
"Humans are frogs in hot water of climate change, research says","The extreme weather that comes with climate change is becoming the new normal, so normal that people arent talking about it as much  and that could make them less motivated to take steps to fight global warming, according to new research. Researchers analyzed more than 2 billion social media posts between 2014 and 2016. What they found was that, when temperatures were unusual for a particular time of year, people would comment on it at first. But if the temperature trend continued and there were unusual temperatures again at that time the following year, people stopped commenting as much. The authors of the study, published in Mondays Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, believe that this is a sign that because of memory limitations and their own expectations and biases, humans may not be the best judges of temperature change. The experience of weather in recent years, rather than over longer historical periods, determines the baseline that people use to evaluate the current weather. Its the boiling frog effect, an urban legend about an experiment that involves putting a frog in a pot of boiling water, where it quickly jumps out. But if its put in a pot of tepid water on a stove and the heat is gradually increased, the frog will stay in the pot until it dies, because it doesnt feel a difference until its too late. In other words, people may not recognize the signs of human-caused climate change until its too late. I think it is quite surprising how quickly the effect of these temperatures decline, said study co-author Frances Moore, an assistant professor in the Department of Environmental Science and Policy at the University of California, Davis. Moore said she doesnt think people are adapting to e extremes. Theyre still pretty miserable in extreme heat or extreme cold, but they stop talking about it on social media, and thats a concern. People will be worse off if they stop talking about it, Moore said. Peoples memories are short, compared to the time scale of climate change. We need to be aware of the disconnect when we communicate about climate change. The disconnect could be bad news for those who want to motivate leaders to do something about it. Officials could also be adjusting to the new normal and not feel the urgency needed to create policies necessary to stop whats causing climate change. This is a very interesting paper and an interesting approach, said John Cook, a research assistant professor at the Center for Climate Change Communication at George Mason University, who researches cognitive science but who was not involved in the new research. He doesnt believe that the studys conclusion is wrong, but he says it conflicts with the data his colleagues have been collecting. Surveys from the center have found a growing awareness and concern about climate change and the climate change people are seeing in their own communities. Cook would love to find out what where the disconnect is. This is catnip for scientists, he said. Cook adds that research has shown that weather affects peoples reaction to climate change, but thats mostly those in the middle of the political spectrum. With Democrats, there is a high level of acceptance and concern about climate change. With Republicans, its lower. You would think with Twitter, it would more likely be on the partisan end of the spectrum, Cook said. This is definitely a great study, and there are a lot of ways to explore this further to understand the disconnect between the survey data and Twitter behavior. Moore hopes people will use her work to shape how they communicate with the public about climate change. We need to be aware, she said. We experience climate change in this noisy way. In some places in the country, there is a lot of variability. Just because it feels cold, that doesnt mean climate change isnt happening. We should be able to communicate to help bridge that divide.",25/02/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/02/25/health/climate-change-boiling-frog-study/index.html
"Earth? fish are disappearing because of climate change, study says","Climate change is endangering fish worldwide, shrinking populations by up to 35% in coastal regions near China and Japan, scientists say. Ocean warming has led to a 4% global decline in sustainable catches, the greatest amount of fish that can be caught without depleting stocks long-term, according to a study published Thursday in the journal Science. Using global data on fisheries and ocean temperature maps, scientists from Rutgers University in New Jersey analyzed changes in sustainable catches triggered by temperature rises between 1930 and 2010. The scientists said they were stunned to discover that global warming has significantly affected fish stocks worldwide and warned that the decline could threaten the livelihoods and food supplies of millions of people. More than 56 million people worldwide work in the fishing industry, and seafood provides up to half of all animal protein eaten in developing countries, the scientists said. The most drastic decline was recorded in Asias coastal regions, including the East China Sea and Japans Kuroshio Current, where stocks plummeted by 15% to 35% over the past 80 years. Ecosystems in East Asia have seen enormous declines in productivity. These areas have particularly rapid warming [and] also have historically high levels of overfishing, said lead researcher Chris Free, a quantitative ecologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara. What is climate change? Your questions answered Shrinking fish stocks in East Asia are concerning, as these regions support the worlds fastest-growing populations and have really large demands for seafood, Free added. As stocks continue to decline, East Asian countries could start importing fish from other parts of the world, driving up prices, he added. Overfishing is intensifying the impacts of climate change, according to Free. Removing the largest fish diminishes a populations reproductive capacity and makes it more vulnerable to global warming in the long term. However, not all fish suffered from ocean warming; some species benefited from a rise in temperatures, the study noted. For example, the black sea bass population off the US East Coast has surged as ocean warming has killed other species and increased its territory, Free said. But climate winners cannot be winners forever, he warned. If temperatures continue to rise, the productivity of these populations is also likely to decline. Could squid protein be an eco-friendly answer to our plastic problem? Governments should eliminate overfishing and establish trade agreements to share stocks between regions benefiting from and hurt by ocean warming, according to Free. Eva Plaganyi of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation Oceans and Atmosphere unit in Canberra, Australia, wrote in an article published alongside the study, that it represented an important advance on earlier analyses, as it provided projections to drive forward planning and adaptation strategies. However, Plaganyi noted that the study did not account for other environmental impacts triggered by climate change, such as ocean acidification. Another study published this week said that a failure to achieve the goals of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, which calls on countries to reduce carbon output and halt global warming below 2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, could threaten the livelihoods and food source of millions of people worldwide. The largest gains will occur in developing country waters, such as Kiribati, the Maldives and Indonesia, which are at greatest risks due to warming temperatures and rely the most on fish for food security, incomes and employment, said lead researcher Rashid Sumaila, director of the University of British Columbias Fisheries Economics Research Unit.",28/02/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/02/28/world/climate-change-fishing-oceans-global-warming-intl/index.html
Is it climate change or global warming? How science and a secret memo shaped the answer,"As director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, Anthony Leiserowitz gets brought in to a lot of conversations about the topic. He shapes stories about it with other scientist for publication. He talks to CEOs and politicians. He gives lectures. Hes ready to answer just about any heavy questions about the complicated subject. But often, the first question he gets is a simple one. Is it global warming or climate change? If I had a penny for every time I was asked that, Leiserowitz mused. The term global warming seemed to be more in vogue in the past decade, although President Trump uses it these days to make fun of the concept on Twitter. In politics, in public policy and in everyday conversation, for the most part, climate change has become more common. The United Nations has the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The National Climate Assessment says it summarizes the impacts of climate change. Congress named its subcommittee Environment & Climate Change, not Global Warming. Check Google trends, though, and the terms seem to be typed into a browser at about the same rate. So, which is it? The experts will tell you its not an either/or answer but more of a yes, and kind of response. And the reason why there are different terms to describe one phenomenon is a tale that reveals how thinking can change on a topic  and how language was shaped by politics and talking points in a secret memo. The first terms used to describe the impact that burning fossil fuel had on the Earths climate were fit for a garden. As early as the 1800s, scientists suspected that industrialization changed the planets temperature. Like Trump, the scientists didnt always think that was bad. Well, Arrhenius lived in Sweden. You cant blame him, Jim Fleming said of Nobel Prize winner Svante Arrhenius, the first scientist to calculate the impact that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere had on temperature. Fleming, a professor of science, technology and society at Colby College who has written about the history of climate science, nicknamed Arrhenius the Cold Swede. The purpose of Arrhenius 1896 paper was to understand the cause of the Ice Age, but later, he linked coal production to greater concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Arrhenius would call this phenomenon drivbank; the Swedish translates to hotbed or hothouse. His colleague, meteorologist Nils Ekholm, used the term greenhouse, Fleming said. Until about the 1970s, scientists had a strong sense that human activity was changing the climate, but they debated whether the planet would get warmer or colder. Often, they would use the term inadvertent climate modification or, scientists say, just stick with the greenhouse effect. Global warming started getting picked up in the scientific literature in the 1970s, after Wallace Broecker popularized the term with his 1975 paper, Climatic Change: Are We on the Brink of a Pronounced Global Warming? The Columbia University professor, whom many called the Grandfather of Climate Science in obituaries in February, urged lawmakers to fund a national effort to understand it better. In 1979, the first decisive National Academy of Science study looking at the impact of CO2 on climate, known as the Charney Report for its chairman, used Broeckers term global warming to discuss the link between the increase in carbon dioxide emissions and surface temperature. It used climate change to talk about the other changes it would bring. The media and some scientists sometimes used the term global change, but really started picking up on the term global warming much more often after covering James Hansens testimony at a Senate hearing in 1988 research shows. Global warming has reached a level such that we can ascribe with a high degree of confidence a cause and effect relationship between the greenhouse effect and observed warming, the NASA scientist famously told the Senate. Lynda Walsh, a professor in the English Department at the University of Nevada, Reno, who specializes in the rhetoric of science, noted that the political stakes got higher in the early 1990s. Thats when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports raise alarms about it. Congress held hearings about global warming. Polls showed growing public concern. Yet the term had its limits. The term global warming confuses people because it triggers thoughts about warmth, and it sort of lends itself to misinterpretation when it also impacts the cold, said Mike Hulme, a professor of human geography at the University of Cambridge whose work focuses on the way climate change is discussed in public and political conversations. Apparently, the Cold Swede isnt the only one who wouldnt mind warmer winters. When Hulme started in the profession in the 1980s, scientists were using the term greenhouse effect. Climactic change or climate change became more popular in the 2000s. I think, on one level, climate change is a more accurate description of what is happening to the world weather systems and is a more neutral phrase, Hulme said. Climate change alters the weather system in ways that arent limited to temperatures. Climate change doesnt just raise temperatures. It can make winters colder and storms more intense. It heats the ocean; it leads to flooding and more wildfires. It kills animals, plants, humans and much more. You could think of global warming as the large macroperspective phenomenon, said Naomi Oreskes, a professor of the history of science and an affiliated professor of Earth and planetary sciences at Harvard University who focuses on climate change. Climate is more complicated. The term global warming also doesnt get at how it impacts weather locally and regionally. In scientific papers, climate change is the term used more frequently, studies show, although scientists will use global warming when specifically referring to the increase in the Earths actual surface temperature. In lectures, many scientists say, they use both. Keep in mind, scientists are trained to talk to each other, but if there are issues like this or like about vaccine safety, we need to think more about how we choose our words and be smart about our language, Oreskes said. Scientists did not workshop the term with focus groups or hire an ad agency to determine what words to use, rhetorician Walsh said. But there certainly were people who hired focus groups, and they had a very clear, non-scientific aim in mind: They wanted to downplay it. Before he was president, Trump tweeted more than once that hoaxsters changed name to CLIMATE CHANGE! But it was Republicans, not Democrats, who initially pushed for the name change. In 2002, GOP strategist Frank Luntz sent a memo to Republican candidates to create an environmental strategy. He argued that the environment is probably the single issue on which Republicans in general  and President George W. Bush in particular  are most vulnerable. The memo suggests that candidates express their sincerity and concern about the environment, but he also wanted them to downplay concerns. Using focus groups, Luntz discovered that  climate change sounds less frightening than global warming,  the memo explained. While global warming has catastrophic connotations attached to it, climate change suggests a more controllable and less emotional challenge. Luntz did not respond to a request for an interview. A New York Times analysis at the time found that President Bush used the term global warming several times in his environmental speeches prior to the memo. Afterward, Bush shifted to climate change. But people didnt all switch because of politics. The National Academies explained in its 2005 report that the phrase climate change helps convey that there are changes in addition to temperature. A 2014 report found that conservatives often used the term global warming more frequently, and liberal think tanks used climate change. Words are not buttons you can press to make them mean only one thing. Thats not the way it works in rhetoric, Walsh said. You have to consider the time and place and the words used and who is using them. When people ask Yales Leiserowitz whether its climate change or global warming, he tells them he uses both. The key thing about terms like this is, they are plastic. Or, well, maybe since we are talking about the environment, we should say words are renewable organic latex or something, Leiserowitz joked. Essentially, meaning changes. Hulme and Oreskes said that some colleagues, to emphasize exactly how dire the situation is, will add a word to the phrase climate change, like anthropogenic or human. Sure, the climate will always change, but to communicate why it is bad, I sometimes will put a qualifier word with it and will say man-made climate change or disruptive climate change,  Oreskes said. Sam White, a historian who studies the role of climate in history, will also call it man-made climate change because there are natural variations in climate as well as man-made climate change which is having a much greater impact, White said. Hulme said he has heard scholars try to come up with new terms, calling it climate chaos, catastrophic climate change or weather weirding. You have various forms of linguistic entrepreneurship to draw attention to this in slightly more melodramatic ways, feeling that climate change is too neutral, Hulme said. Most scientists, at least in the scientific literature, would balk at the idea of putting loaded and charged terms with the phenomenon, said Erik Johnson of the Department of Sociology at Washington State University. Scientists are supposed to be neutral, and other people will do the politics, Johnson said. Im just not sure scientists are capable of getting in the room together to figure out how we frame one message. Hulme said that if people wanted to be really specific, ocean heating may be a more accurate term, because 98% of the extra energy generated by human activity goes into the sea, causing serious problems. But thats still quite esoteric, and I dont see that catching on anytime soon, Hulme said. No matter what terms people use to describe it, scientists and many policy-makers want you to call it something, because its important to keep talking about it. Words can pop loose from their meanings and moorings, Walsh said. Whats most important is that the world continue to talk about what may be one of the biggest threats to this planet.",02/03/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/02/world/global-warming-climate-change-language-scn/index.html
The best and worst airlines for tackling climate change,"Flying is bad for the environment but some airlines are better than others at limiting the damage. No airline is yet doing enough to reduce carbon emissions in the long term, but Delta (DAL) and United are ahead of the pack when it comes to managing their greenhouse gas emissions and the risks related to climate change, according to a new report published on Tuesday. And Europes EasyJet (ESYJY) produces the lowest carbon emissions per kilometer traveled by a passenger, the report also found. The study by the Grantham Research Institute at the London School of Economics concluded that none of the worlds 20 biggest publicly traded airlines is doing enough to tackle climate change. The research was funded by Transition Pathway Initiative, a group of investors with $13 trillion in assets under management that includes BNP Paribas (BNPQF) and Aviva (AIVAF). It said that the aviation sector must step up efforts to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases it produces, rather than rely on an offsetting mechanism that allows it to trade carbon emissions with other industries. In addition to Delta and United, the report called out Germanys Lufthansa and Japans ANA Group (ALNPY), as having gone the furthest on tackling climate change risks. Australias Qantas (QABSY), Alaska Air (ALK) and United scored well on carbon emissions, alongside EasyJet. But ANA scored badly on that measure, as did Korean Air and Japan Airlines (JAPSY). The report said factors such as the age of fleets, the mix of long and short haul flights, the amount of freight carried and the density of seats would all affect carbon emissions per passenger. United, Delta, Lufthansa and ANA have taken account of the risks climate change poses to their business in developing their corporate strategies, a step investors are increasingly demanding from companies across different industries. However, the study said only Delta and Lufthansa have gone as far as linking their climate change targets to executive pay, another common demand from investors. The aviation sector is doing the basics when it comes to carbon performance, but investors are urging them to take more significant steps as they judge which airlines are most likely to survive the turbulence of the transition to a low carbon economy, said Faith Ward, co-chair of the Transition Pathway Initiative. Korean Air, Southwest (LUV) and American Airlines (AAL) were among the companies identified by the study as lagging behind on climate change strategy and long term targets. However, Southwest (LUV) scored well on carbon efficiency. American said it was taking significant steps to reduce its carbon footprint. Some of the worlds biggest airlines were not included in the study. Thats because they are not publicly traded (Qatar Airways and Emirates), or because not enough of their shares are available to foreign investors (Ryanair (RYAAY)). The study also looked at whether airlines current plans for carbon emissions reductions are in line with international pledges, such as the Paris climate accord. It said EasyJet was the only airline on track to meet those benchmarks after 2020. The airline sector currently accounts for 2% of global CO2 emissions. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) is expecting the number of air travel passengers to double to 8.2 billion by 2037, which could mean higher emissions. A spokesperson for IATA said the association wants airlines to ramp up investment in new technologies that would make flying more efficient. However, he added that its not just up to the airlines to become more efficient. The current air traffic control management system is outdated and needs modernizing. That would lead to more efficient routes, the spokesperson added. The industry is also arguing that airlines have to rely on offsetting in shorter term, because there is no technology that could replace the current fuels  unlike in the automobile industry which can increasingly rely on electrification.",05/03/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/05/business/airlines-climate-change-emissions/index.html
How climate change is fueling extremism,"Lake Chad in Africa's Sahel region has shrunk by over 90% since the 1960s due to prolonged droughtExtreme weather events in parts of Africa and the Middle East have bolstered the influence of militants, experts say Countries must invest in climate adaptation programs to prevent citizens from falling into grip of extremists Climate change is already triggering devastating weather events across the planet, including prolonged droughts, flash floods and wildfires. Parts of Africa and the Middle East are experiencing erratic harvests, heavy storms and the worst drought in the past 900 years. Experts say that people here who are struggling to provide for their families are vulnerable to the influence of extremist recruits who offer them work and food. Across the Sahel, a semi-arid region between the Sahara desert and Sudanian Savannah in Africa, temperature increases are projected to be 1.5 times higher than the global average, according to the United Nations. About 50 million people in the Sahel are pastoralists whose livelihoods depend on rearing livestock. But droughts and floods triggered by climate change are shrinking their lands, leaving over 29 million people food insecure. The impact of climate change on the Sahel is clearly shown by the shrinking of Lake Chad. Spanning seven countries, including Nigeria, Niger and Cameroon, the lake basin is critical to the livelihoods of nearly 30 million people. But since the 1960s the lakes water supply has shrunk by over 90%, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. Robert Muggah, who analyzes global climate and security challenges at the Igarape Institute, a think tank in Brazil, says the diminishing water sources are flashpoints for violence as communities struggle with reduced crop yields and high levels of poverty. Climate shocks and stresses are pushing many into extreme poverty. Joining an armed group is sometimes the only option available, he added. What is climate change? Your questions answered In 2018, US officials expressed concern about ISIS and al Qaeda affiliates in the Sahel region. Muggah agrees with this assessment, claiming that the drying of Lake Chad has bolstered recruitment efforts of extremist groups including Boko Haram, the militant group operating in Nigeria. The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) is the worlds most water scarce region. MENA is home to six percent of the worlds population, but only one percent of the worlds freshwater resources, according to the World Bank. 17 countries in the region fall below the water poverty line set by the United Nations, and some experts believe that drought played a part in sparking Syrias civil war. According to a study from 2015, severe drought, likely compounded by climate change, triggered mass migration from rural to urban areas in Syria between 2007 and 2010. The prolonged dry spell led to the death of 85% of livestock in eastern Syria and widespread crop failure, according to Jamal Saghir, a professor at the Institute for the Study of International Development at McGill University. This pushed 800,000 people into food insecurity and prompted 1.5 million people to migrate to already overpopulated cities, contributing to the civil unrest which erupted in 2011 and spiralled into civil war, Saghir told CNN. The impacts of climate-induced drought were also linked to the growing influence of ISIS in the Middle East in a 2017 report commissioned by the German foreign office. The report said that increased water scarcity in Syria played an important role in the forming of ISIS and that ISIS tried to gain and retain legitimacy by providing water and other services to garner support from local populations during the prolonged drought. However, other researchers have disputed how much of a role drought played in the conflict. Can the Middle East solve its water problem? In 2009 ISIS recruitment efforts targeted impoverished farmers in Iraq whose livelihoods were devastated by drought and fierce winds, according to Saghir. Terrorist organizations like ISIS capitalize on the devastation wrought by climate change to attract new members, said Saghir. The ISIS recruiters offered money, food and other riches to rural Iraqis to lure them into joining the ranks of the jihadist group. With no means to sustain themselves through agricultural means, many farmers accepted ISIS bribes for both monetary and morale support, he said. To prevent their citizens from falling into the grip of extremists, countries must invest in adaptation programs, which will reduce peoples vulnerability to extreme climatic events, Nadim Farajalla, director of the climate change and environment program at the American University of Beirut, told CNN. Two ways for countries to become more climate resilient include diversifying their crop production and investing in renewable energy, he said. Countries susceptible to drought should move away from irrigating their crops and focus on rain-fed agriculture, growing crops like lentils and chickpeas instead of the water-intensive livestock feed alfalfa, he explained. Solar power should be harnessed in the fight against extremism, according to Rachel Kyte, CEO of UN initiative Sustainable Energy for All. Providing communities in Africa and the Middle East with clean, affordable energy can help them cope with climate change, advance womens rights and beat back support for extremists, Kyte told CNN. With solar-powered irrigation we have an opportunity to increase agricultural yields in rural communities, giving families greater income and greater economic hope, she said. Muggah agreed that small-scale interventions like solar electricity generators can have a transformative effect on neglected communities. By strengthening and empowering local residents, the influence of extremist groups can be weakened, he said.",06/03/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/06/world/climate-change-terrorism-extremism-africa-middle-east-intl/index.html
"Climate change gets worse management under Trump, investigation finds","The federal government is doing a worse job managing the problem of climate change under President Donald Trump, according to an investigation from the Government Accountability Office that included climate change on its High Risk List report on Wednesday. This years High Risk List is a 293-page assessment of the threats facing the federal government, including such matters as cybersecurity and problems at the Department of Veterans Affairs. The GAO has been putting the list together since 1990 and delivers it to Congress every two years to make legislators aware of the programs that it considers most vulnerable to mismanagement, fraud, waste or abuse and most in need of fixing. Testifying Wednesday before the Senate Appropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee, GAO Comptroller General Eugene Louis Dodaro said that of the many areas that need improvement, three areas have actually regressed, and limiting the federal governments fiscal exposure by better managing climate change risks is one of them. Also in that category were the Environmental Protection Agencys process for assessing and controlling toxic chemicals and NASA acquisition management. Because the government has revoked policies that had partially addressed climate change and has not taken steps recommended in previous reports, this high-risk area requires significant attention, the new report says. The government had been making big strides in improving its leadership on climate change in the Obama administration, according to past reports, but it has not made measurable progress since 2017, the latest report says. Climate change, in particular the severe storms it brings, has cost the American taxpayer nearly half a trillion dollars since 2015, the report says. The last several years have been some of the most costly in US history, Dodaro said. Mark Gaffigan, managing director of the GAOs natural resources and environment team, explained that there have been 241 billion-dollar events, an average of six a year, since 1980. In recent years, there have been many more: an average of about 15 a year. The government would be smart to spend money on the front-end to prepare for climate change, Dodaro said. For every dollar spent in hazard mitigation and resilience building saves $6 later, Dodaro said, citing research from the National Institute of Building Sciences. He said that if the United States were to adopt the most recent international building codes, which take climate change into account, it would save $11 for every dollar invested. The Trump administrations response to flooding that will increase with climate change could also be a problem, he said. Im also concerned that the administration revoked the flood hazard mitigation standard [that] required buildings to be elevated [and] have a national standard in that area, Dodaro said. The federal flood insurance program is also on the High Risk List, he added. Even though Congress has forgiven $16 billion in debt to the Treasury, the program is still more than $20 billion in debt. The report says the Trump administration increased the governments risk by rescinding guidance directing agencies to consider climate change in their reviews of certain federal projects. Climate change also poses a serious threat to the countrys 555,000 defense facilities, according to the report, especially those along the coasts. Asking what should be done about it, Sen. Gary Peters, D-Michigan, cited Tyndall Air Force Base in Panama City, Florida, which was unable to move a number of F-22 Raptors ahead of Hurricane Michael in 2018. Damage to the planes and the base cost $3 billion. They need to have a plan to look ahead as they are building their infrastructure, modernizing their infrastructure, to building resistance, climate resistance policies and procedures, Dadaro said, adding that Camp Lejeune in North Carolina had more than $3 billion worth of damage from Hurricane Florence last year. The government should also create a national climate information system to help state, local and private-sector decision-making, the report said. Better climate change information could help local governments create better building codes, for example. Weather satellite data is the one bright spot in the GAOs new report when it comes to climate change. The previous report singled out aging satellites as a real problem. But now, the GAO determined that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Department of Defense followed its recommendations and created independent monitoring programs, and the departments showed that new satellites did not lead to data gaps. The report probably would not come as a surprise to President Trump, who has repeatedly dismissed concerns about climate change. In November, he dismissed a study produced by his own administration involving 13 federal agencies and more than 300 leading climate scientists, warning of the potentially catastrophic impact of climate change. I dont believe it, Trump said at the time, adding that he had read some of the report. Trump created a White House committee on climate change but put a climate change skeptic in charge. The administration has proposed an end to several programs that fight climate change that were not mentioned in the report. In December, the EPA proposed relaxing regulations for newly built coal-fired power plants, a proposal that its own risk analysis determined would result in 1,400 more premature deaths a year as of 2030. Also in December, the United States sided with Russia and Saudi Arabia to contest language supporting a landmark climate report on limiting greenhouse gas emissions. The United States has reaffirmed its intention to withdraw from the landmark climate agreement called the Paris Accord, and polluters have seen the lowest level of EPA fines under this administration. There has been a call for rapid action on climate change on Capitol Hill. Congress has held dozens of hearings to hear from experts who continue to warn that the government needs to act before its too late. The climate change report released in November said that the nations economy could lose hundreds of billions of dollars  or, in the worst-case scenario, more than 10% of its GDP  by the end of the century and that it would kill thousands of people. Humans are already living with the warmest temperatures in modern history. Even if the best-case scenario were to happen and greenhouse gas emissions were to drop to nothing, the world is on track to warm 1.1 degrees Fahrenheit. Without preparation for changes like this, there is a lot of exposure that the federal government has, Dodaro said.",07/03/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/06/health/trump-climate-change-worse-scn/index.html
"From solar sisters to waste warriors, 5 examples of women taking climate action","Studies show that women are disproportionately impacted by global warmingFrom the Himalayas to Nigeria, women are trying to mitigate the impacts of climate change Climate-related disasters, extreme weather events and depleting water sources affect everyone on earth, but studies show that women are disproportionately impacted by global warming. Women in developing countries are particularly at risk as they are often poorer and more dependent on natural resources than men, according to the United Nations. On International Womens Day, we profile five initiatives led by women fighting for a greener planet. Three hundred women from 100 different countries are sailing to remote parts of the planet over the next two years to raise awareness of the plastic crisis plaguing our oceans. British skipper Emily Penn launched the all-female eXXpedition voyages in 2014 because she was shocked by the trillions of pieces of microplastics she came across while sailing around the world. EXXpeditions aim is to highlight the extent of the plastic crisis and gain a better understanding of the different types of plastic in the oceans, Penn told CNN. Plastic island: How our trash is destroying paradise The women will collect samples of water, sand and air and analyze how they have been contaminated by plastic waste. They will also assess the potential health impacts of plastic pollution, with existing research suggesting that chemicals released by plastics can affect fertility and hormone function. Despite a global backlash over plastic, we are not yet seeing the positive impact on the oceans itself, Penn said. Ridding the oceans of plastic entirely is unrealistic, instead the focus should be on stemming the tide of waste entering them, Penn said. Frustrated by the lack of environmentally friendly food, toiletries and cleaning products in Quebec, Canada, Andreanne Laurin decided to open the provinces first zero-waste shop in 2016. With three other women, Laurin founded Epicerie Loco, a store in Montreal which only sells organic, eco-friendly products in reusable containers. Supermarkets in Montreal waste around 10 percent of their food every day. Our waste [output] is no more than one or two percent, Laurin told CNN. Leftover food does not get thrown in the bin at the end of the day, but instead is reworked into ready meals, she said. We dont accept anything that isnt brought to us in a zero-waste container, store manager Benedicta Porter told CNN, adding that they have completely eliminated single-use packaging by starting a glass jar deposit scheme. The zero-waste movement has grown rapidly in Quebec since Epicerie Loco opened and the province now counts at least 15 other businesses with a similar mission, said Laurin. Single mother-of-five Nanbet Magdalene used to cook on a wood stove, choking on the toxic fumes, with only a kerosene lamp for light. She is one of 74 million people in Nigeria living without electricity, forced to rely on dirty, expensive charcoal and kerosene for energy. Magdalenes life changed completely when she was recruited by Solar Sister, a social enterprise operating in Nigeria and Tanzania. Solar Sister recruits predominantly female entrepreneurs and trains them to sell affordable, renewable energy sources, like solar lamps and clean cookstoves. Its mission is to eradicate energy poverty, empower women and mitigate the impacts of climate change, according to Fid Thompson, the enterprises communications director. What is climate change? Your questions answered Women living in remote, impoverished communities in Africa are on the frontlines of climate change, suffering as a result of extreme weather, deforestation and shrinking farmland, Thompson told CNN. Women are disproportionately vulnerable to extreme poverty and climate change as they have fewer assets and fewer resources than men, she said. Access to renewable energy helps women grow their businesses, provide for their families and save both time and money. With the income from selling solar lamps and clean stoves, I pay for fertilizers and laborers for my field, which helps me to grow more, Magdalene told CNN. Indias Himalayan glaciers are thawing rapidly due to rising temperatures. In the remote Himalayan Ladakh region, melting glaciers are causing severe water shortages and threatening the livelihoods of the people living in the mountain villages below. The Womens Alliance of Ladakh (WAL) has spent the past three decades trying to mitigate the impacts of climate change and mass tourism on their community. An influx of tourists in recent years has led to a huge amount of plastic waste littering the mountain region, WAL secretary Punchok Dolma told CNN. To tackle this problem, she said that WAL has introduced a plastic bag ban and organized litter clean-ups. Read more: Women hold the key to curbing climate change Climate change is also a major concern for Ladakh residents, Dolma said. Melting glaciers are a very big problem. Villages suffer from a lack of water as they depend on the glaciers. Every year people are moving from villages to towns and cities [as] their crops are not growing, Dolma said. The men are the ones moving as they can find jobs in the cities, leaving the women behind to work in the fields, according to Dolma. Faced with diminishing water supplies, the women decided to stop using pesticides and focus on organic farming instead, which uses far less water, she said. Air pollution is one of the worlds biggest invisible killers. It poses a serious health risk, with a recent report estimating that it will cause around seven million premature deaths globally next year and cost the world $225 billion in lost labor. Shocked by the toxic fumes above Israels highways, Shir Esh and Liron Simon founded Airy, a startup producing moss tiles for urban rooftops which absorb CO2 and airborne pollutants. Seeing the effect of pollution on humanity is disconcerting and so we decided to try to make a change, Esh and Simon told CNN. Read: More than 90% of worlds children breathe toxic air Moss has a much larger leaf surface than other plants and acts as a natural air filter, absorbing CO2, nitrogen oxide and dust, according to Simon. Just a couple of square feet covered by moss tiles could absorb the same amount of pollutants as dozens of trees. On average a single tree absorbs 80 kg of CO2 a year, she said. The project, which will be trialed in Tel Aviv, has the potential to prevent thousands of pollution related deaths as well as alleviating greenhouse emission debt, according to Airys founders. Climate change mitigation is the new product that everyone wants to buy and where there is demand there will be supply, they said.",08/03/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/07/world/women-climate-change-global-warming-environment-intl/index.html
Climate change will make a walk in the woods a much rarer pleasure,"If you like to take a walk in the woods in the United States or you prefer to decorate a Douglas fir at Christmas, you should know that climate change is making both of those activities a lot harder. Looking at two ecologically and economically important species  the Douglas fir and the Ponderosa pine  scientists found that fires and drought exacerbated by climate change make new growth difficult, especially in low-elevation forests, according to a study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Some forests in four regions in California, Colorado, the Northern Rockies and the southwestern part of the United States have crossed a critical climate threshold for postfire tree generation, the study says. Climate conditions over the past 20 years have accelerated changes that would have otherwise taken decades or even centuries to play out across broad regions of the country. This is leading to the abrupt decline of trees and making these lands increasingly unsuitable for tree regeneration. Climate change is endangering our forests now, not just in some distant future. Maybe in areas where there are really abundant seed sources, there could be some trees, but it is becoming really hard to get these trees back due to climate change, said study co-author Kim Davis, a postdoctoral research associate in the W.A. Franke College of Forestry & Conservation at the University of Montana. The scientists figured this out by examining tree rings to determine when nearly 3,000 trees were established in these regions, which saw 33 wildfires between 1988 and 2015. Seedlings and juvenile trees are vulnerable to climate change. Seedlings are really sensitive, Davis said. Adult trees have better survival mechanisms to deal with poor climate conditions, but intense wildfires are wiping out these Ponderosa pines and Douglas firs. The trees have thick bark that make them typically good at surviving surface level fires, but they cant survive the more intense fires that move through the canopy, like this region has seen. Had there not been such intense fires, these trees may have lived for centuries. The problem probably wont get any better, as climate change is making intense wildfires much more common, studies show. Western foresters say there used to be a fire season, but devastating and costly fires have become a reality all year long. In 2018, fires cost California more than $9.05 billion, according to the state insurance commissioner, the deadliest and most destructive wildfire season in state history. A higher number of fires and low seed availability means a high probability that these trees in these regions wont come back, Davis said. This study concentrated on the driest and hottest areas of the Western forests, but researchers will next try to determine how much will be impacted. The loss of forests is doubly bad for the planet, studies have found. Forests act as great carbon dioxide absorbers. Additional carbon dioxide, created by power plants and generated when we travel, is whats fueling climate change. Trees are also great for erosion control. They protect area watersheds and are home to a wide variety of plants and animals. The US timber industry heavily relies on the Ponderosa pine and Douglas fir because they have been so plentiful, Davis said. They are also the trees that are closest to towns and are where people like to hike, camp, hunt and fish. There are some things people can do to mitigate some of this problem, Davis said. Forest management plans that reduce high-severity burns can help. Increasingly, forest managers are considering allowing some fires to burn under more moderate conditions, Davis said. Forest managers can also replant trees after fire, at least in the areas where climate conditions will allow. The people we work with who manage forests are planning for climate change, Davis said. They have to, because this isnt something we are predicting for the future. Climate change is already here.",11/03/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/11/health/climate-change-hurts-forests-scn/index.html
Trump tweets climate change skeptic in latest denial of science,"President Donald Trump escalated his denial of global warming Tuesday, when he took to Twitter to quote a noted climate skeptic who claims that climate change is fake science. Trump cited the comments of Patrick Moore on Fox News Fox & Friends program, which identified him as the co-founder of the activist group Greenpeace. According to Greenpeace, however, Moore is not a co-founder but rather a paid spokesman for a variety of polluting industries for more than 30 years. Moore, who is not a climate scientist but who has degrees in forest biology and ecology, played a significant role in Greenpeace Canada for several years early in the organizations existence, according to Greenpeaces website, but he did not help found it. He also exploits long-gone ties with Greenpeace to sell himself as a speaker and pro-corporate spokesperson, usually taking positions that Greenpeace opposes, the group said in a statement in 2010. But the incorrect facts about Moores past and credentials pale in comparison to the incorrect facts in the quote the President chose to tweet. According to Moore, there is no climate crisis. But according to Trumps own governments report from November, the impacts of climate change are already being felt in communities across the country. The National Climate Assessment, which was a collaboration of 13 federal agencies and over 300 leading scientists, found that the US economy could lose hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century because of climate change. There is nothing fake about the climate crisis we face today, said Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist from Texas Tech University who was one of the lead authors of the report. The science behind climate change has been understood since the 1850s. We cannot afford to have politically motivated people spin the issue any longer, Hayhoe said of Moores comments. Although Moore is correct that weather and climate occur all over the world, that obvious statement does not in any way counter the facts that climate is changing and that human activities are the cause. According to a special report last year from the UNs Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, human activities are estimated to have caused approximately 1.0C (1.8F) of global warming above pre-industrial levels (from 1850-1900). That report also projected that the planet could reach dangerous levels of warming by 2030, which would include more heat waves, greater sea level rise, worse droughts and rainfall extremes. And although extreme weather has always occurred, the warming climate is worsening many types of extreme weather  and even causing some of it. US government scientists have pointed to the role that climate change has played in what have been the costliest back-to-back years in weather-related disaster costs, totaling well over $350 billion in 2017 and 2018. Climate change is playing an increasing role, amplifying the frequency and intensity of certain types of extreme weather that lead to billion-dollar disasters, said Adam Smith, lead researcher at NOAAs National Centers for Environmental Information. Carbon dioxide is not one of the six elements generally considered the chemical building blocks of life  but its components, carbon and oxygen, are (along with hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus). According to NASA, carbon dioxide (CO2) is an important heat-trapping (greenhouse) gas, which is released through human activities such as deforestation and burning fossil fuels. And thanks to ever-increasing emissions of it worldwide, carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are higher than at any point in the past 800,000 years. Earths temperature is very closely coupled to carbon dioxide, and even a very small amount of it can have a profound warming impact, said Michael Mann, a climate scientist and director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University. Moores sentiment that carbon dioxide is essential to life on Earth is correct, but too much of it is certainly not a good thing. Mann had an offer for Moore: If he wants proof, Im sure I can raise funds for his one-way trip to Venus.",12/03/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/12/us/trump-climate-change-tweet-patrick-moore/index.html
This artificial leaf wants to help fight climate change,"A man-made leaf may hold the potential to help combat carbon dioxide emissions that lead to climate change. Researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) have created an artificial leaf prototype that is designed to cut down on carbon dioxide  the main greenhouse gas behind global warming and climate change, experts say. CO2 is released by humans through things like electricity, transportation and steel production. In 2016, carbon dioxide made up roughly 81.6% of all greenhouse-gas emissions in the US caused by humans, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. The researchers behind the leaf, who published their work in a recent paper in the journal ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering, are the latest group to try to mimic the work that real leaves do in order to fight emissions. Meenesh Singh, an assistant professor in UICs department of chemical engineering, and Aditya Prajapati, a graduate student in his lab, are behind the artificial leaf prototype. According to Singh, the artificial leaf could be 10 times more efficient than real leaves at converting carbon dioxide to cut down on climate change and produce cleaner energy. Singhs motivation was to create a device that could work outside of a lab. It works in the same way trees and plants absorb carbon dioxide through leaves and turns it into the fuel they need to live. The carbon, which is turned into carbohydrates, is stored while the oxygen is released back into the atmosphere. But the artificial leaf doesnt produce carbohydrates the way real plants do, and instead produces carbon monoxide to create cleaner synthetic fuels. It also produces oxygen gas that can be released into the atmosphere. Singh said the leaf can be used on a small scale such as the roof of a house or on a larger scale at, say, a powerplant. The cube-shaped artificial leaf features an acrylic covering and was made using artificial stomata to mimic the pore-like openings on real leaves. Artificial stoma is a membrane that allows the exchange of negatively charged ions. A lot of research is being conducted around artificial leaves and even artificial trees. But the UIC team has created a prototype thats been tested in a lab and can work in real-world conditions. Still, its unclear when something like this will be ready for large-scale commercial use. Singhs prototype can work using diluted forms of CO2. This more closely resembles the CO2 in the atmosphere as a byproduct of industrial processes. Most other prototypes rely on pure CO2, which is closer to the carbon dioxide found in carbonated water than it is to emissions. Because Singhs leaf can use diluted CO2 it can pull it straight from the air and work outside of laboratory conditions. Singh said the prototype is currently being tested to see at what rate it can continuously capture carbon from the air. Larry Curtiss, a distinguished fellow at the Argonne National Laboratory, believes technology like whats come out of UIC could potentially be effective as a solution for decreasing harmful gases in the atmosphere. This type of innovative lab-scale research is one step to an eventual commercial system that can help to significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions, said Curtiss. Harry Atwater, the director of the Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis, the largest program of its type in the US, agrees that fighting carbon emissions is critical. Atwater said its becoming increasingly apparent that we dont have the capacity to cope with what were putting into the atmosphere. [Singh] has used more dilute sources, and thats important, Atwater said. Its a big conceptual step that opens space for thinking about how we deal with [emissions].",14/03/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/14/tech/artificial-leaf-carbon-dioxide-emissions/index.html
"Climate change could expose 1 billion more people to bug-borne diseases, study says","About a billion more people might be exposed to mosquito-borne diseases as temperatures continue to rise with climate change, according to a new study. As the planet gets warmer, scientists say, diseases like Zika, chikungunya and dengue will continue spreading farther north. The authors of the new study, published Thursday in the journal PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases, created a model that includes data on predicted temperature changes and the known range of the day-biting, disease-carrying mosquitoes Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti. Europe will probably see some of the biggest increases in diseases from both of these species, the researchers say. The United States, East Asia, high-elevation parts of central America, East Africa and Canada will also see large increases in risk for these diseases. The much warmer climates in Southeast Asia and West Africa will not be as suitable for the albopictus species. This study complements previous work on the link between climate change and bugs, well, bugging us to death. The Fourth National Climate Assessment, published by the US government in November, suggested that North America could see some of the largest increases in disease. Other reports have suggested that climate change could halt and reverse progress in human health over the past century. The cases of disease caused by mosquitoes have been increasing. A study in May found that tick- and mosquito-borne diseases have more than tripled since 2004 in the United States. About a sixth of the illnesses and disability cases worldwide come from these conditions, according to the World Health Organization; every year, a billion people are infected and more than a million die from them. The new study found that the number of people who will be at risk for these diseases in any month of the year will increase substantially by 2050, by about half a billion. By 2080, the number of people at risk in one or more months increases to nearly a billion more than currently expected. This model we created is a really large planning tool, said lead study author Sadie Ryan, an associate professor of medical geography at the University of Florida. She hopes officials will use the work to anticipate problems so they can budget and plan to keep the bugs at bay, as such planning has worked well in the past. If you think about why we dont have malaria in the US now, [it] is because we had incredibly successful vector control, Ryan said. We have these tools, but we have to want to use them. Ryan cautioned that countries in South and Central America had mostly gotten rid of Aedes aegypti by the 1970s. Their vector control effort was so efficient. Then we stopped funding it as well, and then it came roaring back in the 80s. The study is provocative and well worth paying attention to, said Dr. Myron Cohen, a professor and director of the Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Cohen was not involved in the study but has worked on research involving mosquito-borne diseases such as Zika. The important question, he says, is whether politicians and policy-makers  the ones who will need to make the changes to slow climate change and prepare for its consequences  see studies like this and act. If Florida, for instance, is going to see a lot of dengue, theyre going to need to be better prepared, and if the southern US is going to suffer more dengue, that would be bad, Cohen said. Information like this is very interesting and very important. We hope politicians and policy-makers will get this and act on this concern.",28/03/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/28/health/climate-change-bug-disease/index.html
"While the rich world braces for future climate change, the poor world is already being devastated by it","Upside down are the only words Manush Albert Alben has to describe life after the powerful Cyclone Idai. Nearly two weeks since the powerful cyclone destroyed most of the city of Beira, Mozambique, it is a long way from normal. Theres no money, no groceries, Alben, a fisherman, said while sitting in his wooden pirogue on a local beach. We are suffering but trying to hold on. Known for its busy port and views of the Indian Ocean, the 19th-century city used to be the fourth largest in the country. Now Beira will go down in history as being 90% wiped out by global warming, said Graca Machel, a former Mozambican freedom fighter, politician and deputy chair of The Elders, who spoke to CNN on the phone after visiting the city. This is one of the poorest places in the world, which is paying the price of climate change provoked mostly, not only but mostly, by the developed world, the 73-year-old added. Hundreds of square miles are covered by water, flooding an area so vast it can be seen from space. Only when the water recedes completely, says Machel, will Mozambique be able to count the bodies. Cyclone Idai is only the latest extreme weather event to blight the region, affecting more than half a million people and filling humanitarian camps with tens of thousands. The 2015-16 El Nino weather cycle, believed to be the strongest in 50 years, severely affected Southern Africas food security, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Dry weather conditions in large swathes of Zimbabwe, Malawi, Zambia, South Africa, Mozambique, Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland, and Madagascar led to about 32 million people being unable to afford or resources to acquire food in 2016. By 2018, drought, population growth and climate change nearly made Cape Town the first city in the world to run out of water. [Cyclone Idai] is a tragic showcase of what can happen in many other similarly situated towns and cities in low and middle income countries, Denis McClean, spokesperson for the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, told CNN. They are vulnerable and they are exposed. Climate change is often described as a problem that will affect future generations. But the worlds most vulnerable are already facing its devastating effects. The United Nations estimates that 4.2 billion people have been hit by weather-related disasters in the last two decades, with low-income countries suffering the biggest losses. Many of the worlds poorest live in equatorial regions, which already have high average temperatures. This means a tiny rise can be sharply felt and lead to harsher impacts, according to a 2018 study in Geophysical Research Letter. Meanwhile, most of the worlds richest nations are the largest emission producers  by burning fossil fuels and modern farming practices that produce climate change causing emissions. Using climate model projections, the paper found that if global average surface temperatures reached the 1.5 or 2 degree Celsius (3.6 degree Fahrenheit) limit  set by the Paris Agreement  countries like Indonesia or the Democratic Republic of the Congo would feel the changes brought on by global warming more keenly than higher latitude countries like the United Kingdom. The results are a stark example of the inequalities that come with global warming, wrote the studys lead author Andrew King, a climate researcher at the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes and the University of Melbourne, Australia. That is not to say that developed countries are immune to its effects. Hurricane Harvey, a storm whose intensity was linked to climate change, caused biblical flooding in the summer of 2017 around Houston and surrounding counties. More than 120,000 people had to be evacuated or rescued, and about 80 people died. And preliminary analysis by researchers at the Environmental Change Institute (ECI) at the School of Geography and Environment in Oxford University, found that Europes uncharacteristically hot and dry summer of 2018 was likely linked to climate change. Wealthy countries like the United States [are] able to prepare and cope with problems like climate change better than poorer countries, Michael Oppenheimer, Princeton Professor of GeoScience and International Affairs, told CNNs Christiane Amanpour. In 2016, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development awarded $48.3 million to the state Louisiana to help with the climate relocation of the entire community on Isle de Jean Charles, which lost more than 97% of its land to the sea in the last 60 years. But in some places poorer countries have actually done a better job than the United States. Because for all our worth  or our wealth, weve been asleep at the wheel and thats due to bad leadership in the federal government, Oppenheimer said. Countries like Mozambique and Bangladesh, whose low-lying, densely populated coastal towns and cities are on the front lines of climate change, have agonized over the issue of a warming planet. It is quite clear that rising sea levels and warming seas contributes to the intensification of these weather events, McClean told CNN. Bangladesh, which saw at least 1,200 die and more than 41 million people affected by monsoon rains and flooding in 2017, is girding for a battle against climate change, Ricardo Safra de Campos, a Research Fellow at the College of Life and Environmental Sciences at the University of Exeter, told CNN. The country has built anti-cyclone shelters, coastal embankments, and invested in a cyclone and flood warning prediction systems. However, its efforts are financially limited, adds Safra de Campos. Beira, which lies below sea level, is no stranger to floods. Officials worried about the low lying city, which is filled with poorly planned settlements. It had flood defenses in place before Cyclone Idai hit. According to the World Bank, funds were provided in 2012 to help the city build flood control stations, a large water retention basin, and the restoration of a storm drainage system and canals. But the cyclones 175 kph (110 mph) winds and and accompanying rains laid waste to Beiras defenses  ripping the foundations of bridges, bursting riverbanks and sweeping away homes. High rates of poverty, a lack of resilient infrastructure, slums and a disappearance of protected infrastructure in low- and middle-income countries create a cocktail of risk, said the UNs McClean. But cities, towns and villages may not stand a chance to withstand the scale and intensity of extreme weather events, which have more or less doubled in the last 40 years, he said. When Super Typhoon Haiyan, which turned into a Category 5 hurricane from the warming waters in the ocean, struck the Philippines in 2013 it became one of the strongest tropical storms in history. Filipinos had never seen anything like it, McClean said. The people in the coastal city of Tacloban could not even describe the seven-meter tidal surge that came with the storm. They simply did not have words to explain what was happening to them, he said. While it is too early to gauge the magnitude of Cyclone Idai, the UN World Meteorological Organization projects the disaster could be among the worst weather-related disasters in the southern hemisphere. The UNs Economic Commission for Africa estimates that Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Malawi, may have lost $1 billion of infrastructure in the cyclone. They lost everything, including the references of their past and cultural heritage, Machel added. Everything is washed away....[but] the social fabric is the one which will be extremely difficult to reconstruct, even when the roads are re-paved, she said. As events in Mozambique, Bangladesh and the Philippines have shown, climate change is a problem of the present. Not just the future.",31/03/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/31/africa/poorest-hit-the-hardest-climate-change-mozambique-intl/index.html
"Canada is warming at twice the global rate, report says","Canada is warming up faster than the rest of the world, according to a report commissioned by the Canadian Environment and Climate Change Department. The report  titled Canadas Changing Climate Report  says, on average, Canadas climate has been and will continue to warm at double the rate of global warming. The report also says since 1948, when records became available, Canadas average land temperature increased by 1.7 degrees Celsius (approximately 3 degrees Fahrenheit). Some of the key takeaways from the report included: Michael Mann, a distinguished professor of atmospheric science at Penn State University, told CNN that the report confirms whats already known, North America, and especially Canada, is seeing even more rapid warming than the planet on the whole, and the impacts are now readily apparent. In the case of Canada, climate change threatens its very identity, melting its glaciers and ice, shortening its iconic winters by turning snowfall into rain, and flooding its beautiful coastlines, Mann said. This latest report drives home the fact that climate change is a dire threat now, and if we dont act to dramatically reduce carbon emissions, that threat will only worsen with time. Katharine Hayhoe, director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech University, said climate change matters because it affects us here and now. Warmer conditions bring summer heat waves, record-breaking floods and wildfires, sea level rise, permafrost thaw, invasive species, and a host of other impacts were not prepared for, Hayhoe said. Understanding how climate is changing in the places where we live and what this means for our future is key to ensuring our future is better, not worse than, today. Similar to Canada, US researchers also warned of the affects of climate change. In November, the US Global Change Research Program released a report saying the economy could lose hundreds of billions of dollars  or, in the worst-case scenario, more than 10% of its gross domestic product (GDP)  by the end of the century. The global average temperature is much higher and is rising more rapidly than anything modern civilization has experienced, and this warming trend can only be explained by human activities, said David Easterling, director of the Technical Support Unit at the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information. Without significant reductions in greenhouse emissions, the annual average global temperature could increase 9 degrees Fahrenheit (5 Celsius) or more by the end of this century, compared with preindustrial temperatures, the report says. One of the impacts of climate change in the US, the report says, is that the Midwestern part of the US is predicted to have the largest increase in extreme temperature and will see an additional 2,000 premature deaths per year by 2090. The report also says more people will be exposed to more foodborne and waterborne diseases, particularly children, the elderly, the poor and communities of color.",02/04/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/01/health/canada-global-warming/index.html
Climate change must be our No. 1 priority,"We are out of time for waiting, debating and half-measures. America needs bold climate action now. And the only way were going to get it is if we elect a president who will make defeating climate change the No. 1 priority of the United States. That is why I am running for president  because if defeating climate change isnt job No. 1, its not going to get done. If elected, I will be the president who gets it done, just like I have as governor of Washington state, a state that is moving forward on building an economy run on clean energy. From floods in Iowa and Nebraska to fires in California, to hurricanes in Houston and Puerto Rico, we can no longer escape the fact that climate change is not happening in some far-off distant future. It is happening now, in communities across America  and it requires an immediate response. Climate change is a matter of great peril, but also one of great promise. We can pioneer the industries of the future, create millions of good-paying jobs and build the clean energy economy of the future. Jobs in this sector are growing twice as fast as the rest of the economy. The fastest growing job in the country is a solar installer. Number two? Wind turbine technician. In other words, climate change is not more important than the economy  it is the economy. And its time for a new national vision to take it to the next level. So, how can we do it? Our new national mission will have four specific goals: First, we will power our economy with 100% clean, renewable and carbon-free energy, and achieve net-zero greenhouse gas pollution with an aggressive sector by sector strategy. Second, we are going to create millions of good jobs in every community by making massive investments in clean energy development and deployment. Third, we will focus on justice and inclusion as a centerpiece of this economic transformation, to ensure that no groups are left to bear the cost of the transition and everyone benefits from new jobs and investment. In this mission, those who are hit by climate change first and worst are the first to benefit. And, finally, we will end billions of dollars in subsidies to fossil fuel industries  and channel that investment into jobs in our new clean-energy economy. If the task we face now feels monumental, it is. If it feels difficult, it will be. The most powerful special interests, big oil and coal, who are spending millions to impede action on climate change, wont just give away their power and their profits. And we cant wait for President Donald Trump to understand the science and the physics. We dont have that kind of time. Thats why fighting climate change cant be somewhere down the page on a laundry list of things to do. It requires building a national mandate for bold and audacious action now and a full-scale mobilization of the federal government. Ive dedicated my life in public service to defeating climate change. And while Im proud of what weve gotten done in Washington while Ive been governor  huge investments in education and infrastructure, the highest minimum wage of any state along with Massachusetts, one of the best paid family leave policies in the nation, strong equal pay laws, the first net-neutrality protections in the nation, and major steps to reduce gun violence  none of that will matter if we dont tackle the growing issue of climate change. So, lets commit to putting American ingenuity, innovation, creativity and hard work into an all-out effort to solve this problem. We are the first generation to feel the sting of climate change, and we are the last generation that can do something about it. We can all be heroes, joining together in a grand mission to save those living on this little blue planet. We have a very short time to act. Whether we shrink from this challenge or rise to it is the vital question of our time.",11/04/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/opinions/climate-change-number-one-priority-jay-inslee/index.html
Climate change is making allergy season worse,"Youre sneezing your head off, and your eyes sting. The air around you is yellow  along with your house, your car, your pets. Yes, of course, you already know that allergy season has arrived. Now for more bad news: Climate change makes it much worse. Nearly 20 million Americans sneeze and sniffle due to pollen and dust, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and many more of us will be BFFs with our tissues in the future. The number of allergy sufferers has grown, research shows. One in 10 Americans struggled with hay fever in 1970, and 3 in 10 did by 2000. Asthma, which can be made worse by exposure to pollen, has become more common too, with higher rates among kids, low-income households and African Americans. Experts think climate change shares some of the blame for this. Warmer temperatures increase the level of airborne pollen because, scientists say, the growing season has, well, grown Between 1995 and 2011, fewer freeze-free days meant 11 to 27 days added to pollen season for most of the United States, research shows. The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, which does an annual survey of allergy season, noticed that its been growing each year. With warmer temperatures, parts of the country are going to get even worse for allergies because plants like ragweed will start migrating north, studies show. New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine will probably see a lot more pollen in the future. Warmer temperatures allow the trees to pollinate earlier and for longer times, said Angel Waldron, the director of communications for the allergy foundation. We didnt used to see our cars covered in pollen before March, but we do now, and we hear from people all the time who are dealing with allergies for a lot longer than they used to when they were little. Thats definitely connected to climate change. If warming continues at its current pace, by the end of the century, the growing season will be longer by about a month in most states. States that werent home to the pollen-producing plants and trees will soon see them in abundance, exposing whole new populations to pollen. Its not just the warmer temperatures adding to our misery. Plants love some carbon dioxide, and when there is more of it in the atmosphere due to the greenhouse gases causing climate change, they flourish. Studies on ragweed show that the amount of pollen the plant produces actually doubles with higher levels of CO2. The pollen becomes more potent too, according to the US Department of Agriculture. There are similar patterns for grass pollen and other plants. You can reduce the impact pollen has on you. There are aisles and aisles of allergy medications at the pharmacy, and Waldron suggests that you talk to your doctor about the one thats best for you. Your doctor should also be able to help you identify what triggers your allergies, so you can avoid them. Spend as little time as possible outside between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., especially on days when the EPAs Air Quality Index says the pollen count is high in your area. To keep from tracking pollen inside, leave your shoes at the door. Change your clothes if youve been outside for a long time. Wash or brush pets who have to go out. Something you might not think of, Waldron said, is to shower at night. Hair works a bit like a mop, collecting pollen thats floating in the air, she said. Since hair is the closest thing to your nasal passages, it can really bother you. If you wash it or brush it out before you go to sleep, or at least cover it, then you wont be sleeping in all that pollen. If you want to help slow climate change, take a look at your own use of the energy that creates the greenhouse gas that make it worse. It sounds simple, but turn out the lights when you leave a room. Use energy-efficent light bulbs, and unplug your computer when youre not using it. Wash clothes in cold water rather than hot, and hang your clothes to dry rather than use a dryer. Take public transportation, carpool, or bike or walk to work, and do what you can to reduce the number of trips you take in the car. As far as pollen, vacuum cleaners with HEPA filters are helpful. Standalone HEPA filters improve indoor air, too. Be sure to look for the asthma & allergy friendly certification mark to make sure they will be your best defense against the yellow stuff. And take heart, winter is only eight months away.",12/04/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/12/health/climate-change-allergies/index.html
The most effective way to tackle climate change? Plant 1 trillion trees,"Whats low-tech, sustainable and possibly the most effective thing we can do to fight climate change? Planting trees. A trillion of them. Tom Crowther is a climate change ecologist at Swiss university ETH Zurich. Four years ago he found there are about 3 trillion trees already on earth  much higher than NASAs previous estimate of 400 billion. Now, his team of researchers has calculated there is enough room on the planet for an additional 1.2 trillion  and that planting them would have huge benefits in terms of absorbing atmospheric carbon dioxide, the main driver of climate change. The amount of carbon that we can restore if we plant 1.2 trillion trees, or at least allow those trees to grow, would be way higher than the next best climate change solution, Crowther told CNN. Because his research is currently under review for publication in the journal Science, he says he cant share exact figures of how much extra CO2 could be stored by those trees. But he points to numbers from Project Drawdown  a non-profit that ranks climate solutions by the amount of CO2 they could remove from the atmosphere. Its number one ranked solution  managing the release of HFC greenhouse gases from fridges and air conditioners  could reduce atmospheric CO2 by 90 billion tons. Crowther says planting 1.2 trillion trees would give a reduction way above that figure. To put that in context, global CO2 emissions are around 37 billion tons per year. Read: Stronger hurricanes could decimate forests, accelerate climate change But while there may be space for a trillion new trees, is it actually practical to plant that number? One organization that thinks so is youth-led Plant for the Planet (PFTP), which is running the Trillion Tree campaign to do just that. Set up as the Billion Tree campaign by the UN in 2006, it was later handed over to PFTP, which has upped its planting ambitions in response to Crowthers work. It has already planted nearly 15 billion trees, with the help of various governments, including Indias, which has planted more than 2 billion trees as part of the initiative. Read: Baobab tree deaths linked to climate change I think a trillion trees is achievable, says PFTP chairman Sagar Aryal. Its not that we dont have enough money in the world  maybe governments alone cant do enough but if we work together with the private sector we can do it. Crowther is a scientific adviser to Plant for the Planet, providing them with information on the best places to restore trees. He says all the locations identified by his team are on degraded land, rather than agricultural or urban areas. These are places where farms have been abandoned, or where theres been deforestation and its been left, he explains. Read: Climate change - do you know the basics? To successfully fight climate change, its vital that the right land is restored. For example, in parts of northern Europe, planting more trees could reduce the heat and light reflected from snowy ground, and actually increase global warming. Joseph Veldman, of the department of ecosystem science and management at Texas A&M University, told CNN that although reforestation can play a role in carbon sequestration, There is no doubt that super-aggressive tree planting efforts that are not done with consideration of the historic ecosystem will be a bad investment. He says some previous reforestation projects have targeted grasslands and savannah ecosystems that already play an important role in storing carbon. Such schemes often plant exotic trees, like pine and eucalyptus, which are very flammable and also valuable as timber and pulp, he says. As a result, the carbon they store above ground can be lost to wildfires or logging. Crowther agrees wholeheartedly. All the models that previously existed about where forest can be restored disregard whether they should, he said. We dont just model the forest, we also model grasslands and shrublands and piece them all together to reveal what should be where. Tree planting is no quick climate fix. It can take 30 to 40 years of growth for the carbon storage to reach its full potential. A more immediate benefit can come from halting deforestation, says Crowther, which costs our planet around 15 billion trees each year. But although tree planting on such a colossal scale faces significant challenges (not least identifying who owns the land in question, and securing the rights to plant and maintain trees there), widespread efforts are already underway. The Australian government has announced it will plant 1 billion trees by 2030; work is underway on a Great Green Wall to stop the spread of the Sahara by restoring 100 million hectares of degraded land (and sequester 250 million tons of carbon), and Chinas anti-desertification program, also known as the Great Green Wall, has planted more than 50 billion trees since the 1970s. The UN-endorsed Bonn Challenge aims to reforest 350 million hectares of degraded land globally by 2030. Crowther says he was once skeptical about the benefits of tree planting, but has now changed his mind. Climate change is seen as such an immense and complicated issue  it feels like its seen as someone elses problem, someone else is dealing with it or not dealing with it, and no one has a simple message for how to go about tackling it, he says. Id like to try and champion this as a solution that everyone can get involved in. If all the millions of people who went on climate marches in recent weeks got involved in tree planting the impact would be huge.",17/04/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/17/world/trillion-trees-climate-change-intl-scn/index.html
Official warning to banks: Get real about climate change or risk going bust,"Central bankers and finance regulators have warned banks to act urgently to fight climate change or risk going bust. The policymakers argue in a new report that banks must lend to responsible partners and invest sustainably or face severe economic disruption and a collapse in asset prices. The Network for Greening the Financial System, which produced the report, includes 34 central banks and regulators from countries including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, China and Japan. The group argues that financial companies face major risks from climate change. Increasingly extreme weather threatens to disrupt trade, production and hurt economic growth, while increasing insurance payouts and squeezing property prices. Another major risk from climate change is a sharp decline in the value of assets owned and traded by financial institutions. Potential examples include stock in oil companies or stakes in coal-burning power plants. The group warned that climate risks are not being properly reflected in asset prices, and they pledged to take steps that will make banking more responsible and green. The enormous human and financial costs of climate change are having a devastating effect on our collective well-being, members of the group, including Bank of England boss Mark Carney, said in an open letter. The report recommends that central banks and other regulators integrate climate change risks into their supervisory activities  for example by stress testing banks on their vulnerability to climate change. They should also help financial institutions decide which assets are sustainable and which are not, allowing them to make informed investment decisions. The 2015 Paris Agreement asks countries to keep global warming well below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels this century and, if possible, below 1.5 degrees. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said last year that carbon dioxide emissions would need to fall by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 and reach net zero around 2050 to limit warming to 1.5 degrees. The agency said that doing so would mean huge changes in energy, industry, buildings, transportation and cities. If some companies and industries fail to adjust to this new world, they will fail to exist, the policymakers said in their open letter on Wednesday.",17/04/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/17/business/banks-climate-change-warning/index.html
Joseph Stiglitz: Corporate greed is accelerating climate change. But we can still head off disaster,"Americas economy has not been working for a large portion of the country. Workers at the bottom of the income scale earn wages, adjusted for inflation, that are not much higher than what they were 60 years ago, while the income of a typical fulltime male worker hasnt budged much from 40 years ago. In addition, life expectancy is in decline. But the economy is not only failing American citizens. Its failing the planet, and that means its failing future generations. There are many reasons for our plight, including corporate power and greed centered on immediate profits and little regard for the impacts business decisions have on low-income Americans and the environment. Corporations have translated their economic power into political power, lobbying for policies that give them free rein to despoil the environment; and the swamp President Donald Trump promised to drain has been overflowing. At the same time, Trump has publicly asserted that climate change is a hoax, and yet his administration has repeatedly been forced to admit it is a reality  in response to climate lawsuits such as Juliana v. United States, for which Im an expert witness. Climate change is real, and it includes not only an increase in the average temperature, but also more extreme weather events including droughts, floods and hurricanes that have led to a large number of deaths. The United States has borne enormous costs as a result of the warming planet  in 2017, more than 1.5% of GDP. By the end of this century, some sectors of the US economy, including agriculture and energy, could lose hundreds of billions of dollars a year because of climate change, according to the latest report issued by the U.S. Global Change Research Program. So there is a real urgency to respond to our economic malaise and our climate crisis. The good news on this Earth Day is that these are problems of our own making, and that means a change toward pro-Earth policies can make a big difference. Even better, the major investments we need to respond to the crisis would be a spur to the economy. This is one of the central messages of the Green New Deal. The transition to the green economy, in which we rely on renewable energy, wont happen on its own, however. It will require a mobilization of resources  the kind we saw during the New Deal and the Second World War. Government will have to take the lead, and it will require public investments  including in infrastructure and research  and regulations. Environmental regulations such as the Clean Air Act can and have worked, and typically are very costeffective. Without these measures, our air would be even more unbreathable than the air in New Delhi or Beijing today. Dealing effectively with climate change is well within our reach; in fact, I recently cochaired an international commission that showed that the global goals of limiting the increase in global temperatures to 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius were clearly achievable. It would make so much more sense to spend money retrofitting our economy to reduce the risk of disastrous climate change rather than spending money to deal with the enormous economic and human costs of coping with its consequences. Some of the required resources would come simply from eliminating the huge subsidies we provide for fossil fuels, or from taxing corporations that inflict damage on our environment. This would encourage corporations to work hard to prevent it. But there are broader changes that would help grow the economy, providing some of the needed resources: curbing the excesses of corporate power more generally would lead to a more efficient economy and to more equality. So, too, would curbing the abuses of corporate governance, like CEOs paying themselves so much at the expense both of workers and investment. Policies that reduce discrimination in the labor market and provide more flexibility in hours are examples of supplyside measures that work. And over the long run, education policies that help all citizens live up to their potential would also help the economy grow. The mobilization during World War II had some longterm salutary effects on our economy and society: It brought women into the labor force and it helped transform us from an agrarian to an urban society. The mobilization required to fight climate change has a similar potential. As we restructure our economy and society away from a highcarbon economy and toward a more sustainable one, we should seize this opportunity to create the society that benefits all of us, as well as the planet.",21/04/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/21/perspectives/joseph-stiglitz-earth-day-economy/index.html
We?e losing the war on climate change,"For years now, people like environmentalist and journalist Bill McKibben have been screaming from the treetops that we need a World War II-scale mobilization to fight the scourge of climate change. Theyre right, of course. And on Earth Day  that 24-hour sliver of the calendar when we talk about the fact that humans exist on, and because of, a living planet  its clear not only that we are losing this war but that we still are failing to recognize its taking place at all. I mean, yes, Ive met Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teen who is schooling world leaders on climate policy and who started a global school walkout movement. Ive read the Green New Deal and seen the videos of young people demanding that US reps adopt it. Just this month, protesters in London shut down parts of the city in their calls for a reckoning. Its true that clean energy sources keep getting cheaper. Electric cars are more popular than ever. But the scale of the outrage in no way matches the magnitude of this disaster, which, like WWII, threatens to cripple or even obliterate human life on the planet as we know it. Weve known the truth about climate change  that people are burning fossil fuels and warming the atmosphere, with potentially catastrophic consequences  for decades now. James Hansen testified about the dangers of global warming when he was an NASA scientist in 1988. The New York Times headline: Global Warming Has Begun, Expert Tells Senate. Since then, the eco-woke among us have created more than enough deadlines to try to force change. In 1990, as George Marshall wrote in his book Dont Even Think About It, the magazine Ecologist published a book called 5,000 Days to Save the Planet. About 5,000 days later, the Institute for Public Policy Research declared that there were Ten Years to Save the Planet. In 2008, he wrote, the New Economics Foundation said it was 100 Months to Save the World. As a journalist whos been covering climate for years, Ive been part of that deadline trend. In the leadup to the Paris climate talks in 2015, I wrote that there were 100 days to save the world. The deadlines arent the problem. Its our failure to heed them. The situation gets only more dire with years of inaction. Last year, the worlds climate science experts  the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  released a report issuing some deadlines based on the harsh realities of science and math. They said global carbon pollution must be cut in half by 2030 and reduced to net zero by 2050 to avoid the worst consequences of climate change, which include drowned coastal cities, worsening storms and the virtual end of coral reefs. There is a global push to try to meet those goals. That takes the form of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which urges countries to cut emissions but fails to issue sanctions. The United States, which has done more to cause global warming historically than any other nation, has promised under the Trump administration to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. How far along are we on those pollution-reduction goals? We havent really started. Global emissions from fossil fuels rose in 2018  to an estimated 37 gigatons. Remember, carbon pollution needs to be cut in half in just 11 years. And to net zero by mid-century. That requires a near-total overhaul of the global economy  a rapid transition to cleaner fuels like wind, solar and, probably, nuclear. It seems increasingly likely that some sci-fi technologies, like aerosols that would reflect heat back to into space, may be needed. Project Drawdown and others have identified and ranked the solutions that work. But to date, there have not been enough carbon taxes or other incentives to scale those ideas globally. Part of the issue is a failure to recognize the magnitude of the problem  or, as others have written, a failure to care about the massive debts we are pushing onto future generations. Researchers like Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, have argued that people are finally waking up to the climate crisis, particularly in the face of the Trump administration, which has denied the science and enlivened activists, and in light of the apocalyptic-seeming severe weather that has hit parts of the globe. A poll from that Yale group showed in 2018 that 59% of Americans were alarmed or concerned about global warming, which is up compared with the previous five years. Those concerns dont necessarily translate into political action, though. A 2018 report from Gallup found that climate change ranked as only the 11th most important issue for American voters  behind health care, the economy, immigration, the treatment of women in US society, gun policy, taxes, foreign affairs, income and wealth distribution, Brett Kavanaughs confirmation to the Supreme Court and US trade and tariff policies. Think about that in terms of the World War II analogy, Imagine the American public ranking WWII as No. 11 after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Perhaps you think we havent seen the global warming version of Pearl Harbor yet. But we have seen it. Remember the European heat wave of 2003? An estimated 70,000 people died, according to a study published in the journal Comptes Rendus Biologies. After that disaster, scientists for the first time used climate attribution techniques to show that human-induced warming very likely doubled the risk of that event. Its now possible to see human fingerprints on these catastrophes. Hurricane Harvey in Texas; the 2016 floods in Baton Rouge; Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, which killed an estimated 2,975 people, according to an analysis by George Washington University. Each was linked to  or was shown to have been made worse by  global warming. Not every weather-related disaster is caused by climate change, of course. But the world is 1 degree Celsius warmer since the Industrial Revolution because of pollution humans are pumping into the atmosphere. And this is a game of probability. As Kerry Emanuel, an MIT climate scientist, is fond of saying: Weather forms in that climate-changed world. Hurricanes intensify more rapidly; wildfires grow larger and more threatening; rainfall is more intense. Coral reefs struggle to survive. There are no truly natural disasters now. The war may remain invisible to many, even on Earth Day. But we are well into the middle of it. And we are not winning.",22/04/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/21/world/sutter-earth-day-climate-scn/index.html
"Federal report contradicts EPA chief? claims that climate change impacts are decades away, environmental group says","President Donald Trump reminded the public on Monday, in honor of Earth Day, that while his administration values the environment, environmental protection and economic prosperity go hand in hand. Trump and EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler have publicly stated that climate change is not the White Houses main environmental priority. In March, in his first televised interview after being confirmed as the EPA chief, Wheeler told CBS that most of the threats from climate change are 50 to 75 years out, contradicting the conclusions of top scientists in the US government and international organizations like the UN. Instead, Wheeler stressed that access to clean drinking water was the greatest concern facing the environment, a sentiment echoed in the White Houses Earth Day statement, which said the administration is working to strengthen the security and reliability of our drinking water and accelerating spending on water infrastructure. An analysis by the environmental advocacy group the Sierra Club, released Monday, found nine instances in which Wheelers statements about the delayed impact of climate change were directly contradicted in the National Climate Assessment, a government-sponsored climate analysis authored by scientists from 13 federal agencies that was released in November. (there is no link to this analysis because they gave it to us exclusively) Other major scientific studies, including one produced by the United Nations International Panel on Climate Change, also contradict Wheelers claims. Human-induced global warming has caused multiple observed changes in the climate system, according to the International Panel on Climate Change Special Report. Here are nine examples from the National Climate Assessment directly contradicting Wheelers statement that climate change impacts are still 50 to 75 years away, according to the Sierra Clubs analysis. Sea level rise has already increased the frequency of high tide flooding by a factor of 5 to 10 for several U.S. coastal communities, according to the National Climate Assessment. The report says that the rise has contributed to coastal flooding since the 1960s. Between 1901 and 2016, the global average temperatures have increased by 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit, and there is no evidence that the rise in temperature has been caused by any natural explanation, according to the report. The evidence consistently points to human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse or heat-trapping gases, as the dominant cause, the report states. Each decade has been the hottest on record in succession over the past 30 years. Seventeen of the 18 hottest years on record have occurred since 2001, according to the report. Areas burned by wildfires covered twice what would have burned if climate change had not occurred from 1984 to 2015. The area that was burned by wildfires between 1916 and 2003 was more closely related to climate factors than to fire suppression, local fire management, or other non-climate factors, the report states. Trump was highly critical of the Interior Department and Californias government during the California wildfires in fall 2018. He publicly blamed gross mismanagement for the devastating wildfires, saying it was largely caused by poor forest management in tweets. The report found that global warming has led to coral diseases and mass bleaching off Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, Florida, Hawaii and the US-affiliated Pacific Islands. These diseases threaten reef ecosystems. Climate change is already affecting the Department of Defenses infrastructure, according to the report, by damaging roads, runways, and waterfront infrastructure. Wheeler said that access to clean drinking water worldwide was the biggest environmental threat. Climate change is affecting the water infrastructure that keeps water in our country clean. Changes in the frequency and intensity of climate extremes, compared with the 20th century, are deteriorating water infrastructure, the report states. The report found that climate-related impacts are causing some US indigenous communities to consider or actively pursue community re-location as an adaptation strategy. Because they are struggling with severe effects of climate change, the residents are considering uprooting their communities, which could make it harder to maintain cultural and community continuity, the report notes. Climate change is affecting the health and well-being of the American people, according to the report. Climate-related changes in weather patterns and associated changes in air, water, food and the environment are causing injuries, illnesses and death, the report states. While access to clean drinking water is a major issue in the United States and around the world, under Wheeler, the agency changed two policies to weaken regulatory protections for water.",22/04/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/22/politics/sierra-club-climate-change-scn/index.html
"Climate change makes poor countries poorer, widening global inequality, researchers say","Climate change is having a serious impact on economic growth across the world  and its worse for poor countries that already had a lot of catching up to do, according to a new study. Two Stanford University researchers modeled the country-by-country effects of global warming over a 50-year period, and published their findings in a paper out Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Countries with the hottest climates suffered the most economic damage, the study showed. Indias gross domestic product per capita, for example, was 31% lower in 2010 than it would have been if not for global warming caused by human activity over the prior half century, the study found. Chads economic activity per person was 39% lower, Venezuelas was 32% lower, and Nigerias was 29% lower. In absolute terms, many of those countries have actually boosted their economic output significantly over the past half century, and as a result, inequality between countries has declined in recent years. However, that progress could have moved faster if temperatures werent rising, the study found. It represents a number of years of economic development that have effectively been delayed, said Noah Diffenbaugh, a senior fellow at Stanford Universitys Woods Institute for the Environment who co-authored the report with Stanfords Marshall Burke. There wouldve been a greater convergence, and less inequality on the country level than what we have seen, if global warming hadnt occurred. The report doesnt describe exactly how rising temperatures have depressed economic growth. But other research has demonstrated how warming above a certain optimum average temperature  estimated in a previous study by Burke at about 13 degrees Celsius, or 55 degrees Fahrenheit  can dry out farmland, lower cognitive function, decrease worker productivity and increase interpersonal conflict, among other effects. To me this confirms and quantifies trends that we have been seeing in a lot of poor countries, Rebecca Carter, deputy director of the climate resilience practice at the nonprofit World Resources Institute, said of the findings. Carter pointed to Costa Rica, which the study estimated has 21% lower GDP-per-capita than it would have without human-caused global warming. There, coffee farmers have seen lower yields and more frequent disease outbreaks due to higher temperatures. In some parts of the country their harvests have been undermined gradually, year after year after year, Carter said. Wealthier countries have historically generated the most greenhouse gas emissions, which tend to rise with industrialization and personal consumption unless effective pollution controls are imposed. Rich countries also tend to be further north and have cooler temperatures, on average. And they may, in fact, actually have benefited from the warming trend as they approach the optimum temperature for economic growth, further widening inequality across countries. For example, the study found that Icelands economic output is nearly double what it wouldve been without man-made temperature change  the largest outlier in the results. Countries like Canada, Norway, and Finland also benefited, adding between a quarter to a half of their per capita GDPs on account of warming between 1961 and 2010, according to the study. That could happen if agriculture benefits from longer growing seasons, for example, or if fewer snowstorms interrupt transportation. The idea that rich countries have benefited from climate change is controversial, and that part of the study has encountered skepticism from others in the climate science field. Two outside experts who reviewed the study at CNN Business request, Wolfram Schlenker of Columbia University and Solomon Hsiang of the University of California-Berkeley, each said that its conclusions are weaker when taking into account the response of countries to warming over time. For example, a hot year might temporarily reduce GDP in a year, but it might rebound in future years, Schlenker wrote in an email. The study also looked at the response to temperature changes with five-year lags, and under those parameters, the previously apparent benefits for richer, cooler countries faded away. Even under that scenario, however, the authors found there was a 66% likelihood that climate change widened the gap between rich and poor countries. The authors consider this case in the last table of the appendix and find that inequality would have almost not changed using this approach, I believe because everyone (rich and poor) suffers so economic gaps do not widen as much, wrote Hsiang, who co-authored a 2015 paper with Burke upon which much of the new analysis is based. I think this finding is important and probably should have been the main approach, since its likely closer to the truth. Diffenbaugh acknowledged that the results showing climate change has enriched wealthy countries have the most uncertainty around them. However, he stood by the finding that climate change has very likely widened inequality across countries, because the evidence of deep negative impacts for poorer nations is so strong. Thats something that other large climate studies, such as the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, have also affirmed  especially when it comes to more qualitative impacts on human health and vulnerable ecosystems. Previous work has also looked at the unequal impact of climate change within countries and across income groups, making clear that wealthier individuals of all nationalities are better-equipped to adapt to or shield themselves from a warming world. Wealthier people can often work inside with the benefit of air conditioning and are more likely to be able to afford to relocate or rebuild if storms reach their homes. A study released last year by Hsiang and co-authors, for example, projected that the poorest counties in the United States would see the largest negative effects from climate-change events like droughts and hurricanes because theyre already concentrated in the steamy deep South. But the new study is among the first to boil the impact of climate change down to an estimate of national economic output, which is a simple way of understanding how people are faring on average within each country. Even though people are impacted differently within the US, for example, the Stanford researchers found that climate change had little to no effect on overall GDP-per-capita between 1961 and 2010. For countries that are negatively impacted, the broader economy is less able to absorb and respond to the people who are hardest hit. When we say standard of living, we mean real income, which means GDP-per-capita, said Branko Milanovic, a professor at the City University of New York who studies global income inequality and who also reviewed the new report at CNN Business request. If climate change is particularly bad for poor countries, that means climate change would make elimination of poverty extremely difficult. Furthermore, negative impacts even in cooler countries can ramp up quickly. The melting of ice in Alaska has prevented indigenous residents from hunting whales, for example, and algae blooms have turned lakes from tourist destinations into dead zones. And of course, poor countries dont suffer in isolation. Poverty can spark or worsen political conflict, and residents displaced by wars and drought often end up seeking refuge in richer countries. We cant assume that whats happening somewhere across the globe isnt going to have impacts in richer countries, said David Waskow, director of the International Climate Initiative at the World Resources Institute. To me this is an indication of the way in which those who are on the front lines of the problem are being affected in ways that we should anticipate will spread.",22/04/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/22/economy/inequality-climate-change/index.html
O?ourke releases plan to fight climate change with $5 trillion investment and net-zero emissions by 2050,"Beto ORourke on Monday released his plan to tackle climate change in his first major policy proposal as a 2020 candidate. ORourke plans to invest $5 trillion over 10 years in infrastructure and innovation and also sets a goal to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, according to an outline of ORourkes proposal which his campaign put out ahead of a tour of Yosemite National Park on Monday. The former Texas Democratic congressmans plan called climate change the greatest threat we face and outlined a four-part framework to address this existential threat and growing emergency. If elected president in 2020, ORourkes very first bill he sends to Congress ... will mobilize $5 trillion over 10 years  spurred by the single largest investment to fight climate change in history  to transform our aging infrastructure, accelerate innovation, and empower our people and communities to lead the climate fight, according to his plan. ORourkes ambitious, first major policy rollout comes amid questions from voters and critics about how he would take on key issues should he be elected president. Climate change has become a major issue for 2020 Democrats in the wake of a stark 2018 report from the global scientific authority that says governments around the world must take rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society to avoid disastrous levels of global warming. The planet has only until 2030 to stem catastrophic climate change, the report, issued by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, warns. According to his proposal, ORourkes $5 trillion mobilization would be directly leveraged by a fully paid-for $1.5 trillion investment, and the bill he would introduce to Congress would be funded by changes to the tax code to ensure corporations and the wealthiest among us pay their fair share and that we finally end the tens of billions of dollars of tax breaks currently given to fossil fuel companies. ORourke plans to take a series of forceful executive actions to start cutting pollution across all sectors of the economy on his first day in office, and re-enter the Paris agreement, a global accord on reducing harmful emissions that President Donald Trump withdrew the US from in 2017. The plan says ORourke would lead the negotiations for an even more ambitious global plan for 2030 and beyond. Earlier this month, when asked by CNN if re-entering the Paris climate agreement would be the first thing that would get his signature if he becomes president, ORourke said, It is among a number of things that I want to do, also listing protecting Dreamers and people protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program as well as reversing the effort to ban Muslim travel, as his day one priorities. ORourkes climate change plan would set a first-ever, net-zero emissions by 2030 carbon budget for federal lands, stopping new fossil fuel leases, changing royalties to reflect climate costs, and accelerating renewables development and forestation. We need a guarantee that we will, in fact, achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and get halfway there by 2030, according to the plan. For this reason, Beto will work with Congress to enact a legally enforceable standard  within his first 100 days. The emission reduction goal is in line with the Green New Deal, a broad policy proposal from progressive Democrats to battle climate change among other issues, which is backed by several 2020 Democrats, including ORourke. By investing in infrastructure, innovation, and in our people and communities, we can achieve this ambition, which is in line with the 2050 emissions goal of the Green New Deal, in a way that grows our economy and shrinks our inequality. He will focus on defending our communities ... that are preparing for and fighting against fires, floods, droughts, and hurricanes. When asked who is advising ORourke on energy, a campaign spokesperson told CNN, Beto consulted with impacted individuals and communities, academics, scientists, entrepreneurs, advocates and activists, and local, state, tribal, and federal government leaders. Throughout this campaign, he has listened to Americans all across the country and made their ideas and concerns part of his platform as he hes held 113 town halls in 88 cities and answered 625 questions, the spokesperson said. Thats how he learned more about record f(l)ooding in Iowa, drought in Nevada, a fight over offshore drilling in South Carolina, historic conservation efforts in New Hampshire, plans to protect the water and forests of Virginia, and wind and solar job growth throughout Texas.",29/04/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/29/politics/beto-orourke-climate-change-policy/index.html
"UK should slash emissions to net zero by 2050, say climate change advisers","The UK should aim to cut its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, according to its chief advisory committee on climate change. If adopted, the target proposed in a report by the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) would be the most ambitious emissions reduction goal set by any large economy. Net zero means that any emissions are balanced by an equivalent amount taken from the atmosphere. The UK government doesnt have to act on the findings, but it commissioned the report after the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned last year that the world has less than 12 years to slash emissions and avoid disastrous levels of global warming. The IPCC says global greenhouse gas emissions need to reach net zero around 2050. The CCC says the new target is necessary, feasible and cost-effective but that it requires drastic action, including phasing out petrol and diesel vehicles completely by 2035, planting 30,000 hectares of trees each year and cutting beef, lamb and dairy consumption by 20% by 2050. At a briefing ahead of the report launch, Lord Deben, CCC chairman and former secretary of state for the environment, said, This net-zero target puts us at the top of the pile. We say to the government: this can be done, you have the proof, but it wont happen unless you take the lead. It comes a day after the UK parliament declared an environment and climate emergency, making it the first country in the world to do so, according to the opposition Labour Party. Combat climate change by cutting beef and lamb production To achieve the net-zero target tens of billions of pounds will need to be invested in renewable energy, electric vehicles, capturing and storing carbon emissions, and planting trees, according to the CCC. Currently the UK has a target of curbing greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050, compared to 1990 levels. Emissions had fallen by 42% in 2016. The CCC report suggests a 2045 target for Scotland as the country has greater potential to remove pollution from its economy and said Wales should aim for a 95% emissions reduction by 2050 due to its large sheep farming industry. Following the release of the report, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland would commit to the new target and continue its global leadership in tackling climate change. The new target encompasses all greenhouse gas emissions, including those from international aviation and shipping  two industries that do not fall under the 2015 Paris climate agreement, which calls on countries to reduce their carbon output and halt global warming below 2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. Costs to reach the 2050 goal will total 1-2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) per year, the same amount estimated for the current target, the report said. The recommendations come as climate activism is sweeping the globe. In March, hundreds of thousands of schoolchildren walked out of class to protest their governments failure to curb emissions. Last month, Extinction Rebellion activists glued themselves to trains and blocked major landmarks in London to demand climate action. Extinction Rebellion activist Rupert Read told CNN that the 2050 target would not mitigate the long-term impacts of climate change and that the UK should aim to eliminate emissions by 2025. We [the UK] started the industrial revolution. We started the path that has lead us to this precipice. We have a responsibility to help lead a common way out of this looming catastrophe, he said. More than half of British adults, 54%, believe that climate change threatens our extinction as a species, according to a ComRes poll of 2,037 Great Britain adults online on 26-28 April 2019. Data were weighted to be representative of all adults. Fish are disappearing because of climate change Professor Jim Watson, director of the UK Energy Research Centre, said that a net zero UK economy is technically achievable but that it relies on the treasury monitoring emissions as closely as we monitor GDP growth and employment. He added that a zero emissions strategy should provide the right incentives for businesses and have justice at its heart. Mark Maslin, professor of climatology at University College London, said that the 2050 target is too far in the future. As one of the leading countries in the fight against climate change, Britain must adopt a 2030 zero-carbon target, giving us 10 years to put in place win-win solutions that reduce carbon emissions, save money and make Britain a better, cleaner place to live, he said. In its motion to Parliament on Wednesday to declare a climate emergency, the Labour Party called for the government to achieve net zero emissions before 2050, while the UK Green Party has said it wants to achieve net zero by 2030.",02/05/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/01/uk/uk-emissions-net-zero-2050-scn-intl/index.html
"Climate anxiety is real, but there? something you can do about it","A student in Wendy Petersen Borings climate-change-focused class said she woke at 2 a.m. and then cried for two solid hours about the warming ocean. This is a computer science major, Petersen Boring said. Petersen Boring, an associate professor of history, religious studies, women & gender studies at Willamette University in Oregon, has been teaching about climate change for a little over a decade. In that short time, she has watched her students fear, grief, stress and anxiety grow. Back in 2007, it was the mouse in the room; then, it became the elephant in the room. By 2016, those concerns and fears began to flood over, Petersen Boring said. Her students arent alone. Polls show that many more Americans worry about global warming. Theres no clinical definition, but climate anxiety and grief or solastalgia  the distress that is produced by environmental change impacting on people while they are directly connected to their home environment  has become such a concern that the American Psychological Association created a 69-page climate-change guide to help mental health care providers. There are support networks like Good Grief in Salt Lake City, created to help people build resilience while discussing eco-anxiety, despair and inaction on the environment. Theres even a growing number of organizations of people promising not to have children due to the severity of the ecological crisis and the current inaction of governing forces in the face if this existential threat, as a group called BirthStrike puts it. Who can blame them? This years climate change headlines are depressing on a good day, terrifying at worst: One million species threatened with extinction because of humans 250,000 deaths a year from climate change is a conservative estimate, research says CO2 levels at highest for 3 million years Climate change linked to greenhouse gas emissions has created record high temperatures and more extreme storms, droughts and wildfires. Those climate change-related natural disasters have had a profound negative impact on the mental health of survivors of these extreme events, according to the United Nations. Suicides have increased, as have depression, anxiety, stress, grief, anger and PTSD. Even for people who arent directly affected by natural disasters, climate change is causing measurable mental distress. Higher temperatures alone have led to more suicides and increased psychiatric hospitalization and have hurt our sleep, which can also also harm mental health. These problems will get worse as the temperature continues to rise, research shows. Its going to take an enormous global effort to keep the planet from that catastrophic point. Yet the Trump administration has buried government reports on climate change. Trump pushes for American energy dominance, developing initiatives that reward greenhouse gas-producing industries. This lack of political will is compounding some peoples anxiety, experts say. With the Trump election, the change in my students, the sense of grief and fear and paralysis in the room, became palpable, Petersen Boring said. Paralysis caused by fear is a real problem, said Susan Clayton, one of the lead authors of the American Psychological Association guide. The psychological responses to climate change such as conflict avoidance, fatalism, fear, helplessness and resignation are growing, said Clayton, a psychology professor at the College of Wooster. These responses are keeping us, and our nation, from properly addressing the core causes of and solutions for our changing climate and from building and supporting psychological resiliency. It makes sense and there is a straightforward therapeutic response to this, Clayton said. Penn State psychology Professor Janet Swim, who has authored several publications about psychology and climate change, puts it this way: Anxiety is something people feel more and more when they get closer to an anti-goal, meaning a negative result, like the destruction of the planet. People who are anxious tend to be avoidant, or they shut down and dont engage. To ease this feeling of anxiety, turn it around. Instead of focusing on the fear, you should instead focus on what you want to do, Swim said. If you get closer and closer to a solution, you can feel more pride and there is hope. If you struggle with anxiety about climate change, take a note from people who remain resilient even when the world looks bleak. Typically, they have a strong sense of self and a good support network, Clayton said, and they find ways to take action be it big or small, action eases anxiety and it matters. We cant just all curl up in a ball and wait for the end of the world, Clayton said. Find a group working on climate change and join it. You dont have to be the one standing out there with a protest sign, Swim said. That may work for extroverts, but for the introverts or those people who dont like to march, you can also get a group together to write your representatives and ask them to act. Movements also need people to coordinate activities or to help nurture those who are on the front lines. Feeling connected to people and knowing you can count on them matters, Clayton said. Personal action can give you a sense of purpose and meaning and make you feel less helpless. If you dont like to protest, find other groups that raise awareness or work to fight climate change. Join an urban cleanup or participate in a walk or ride focused on climate change. Swim is about to help lead Pennsylvania Interfaith Power & Lights 200 mile bike ride through Pennsylvania to Washington, DC. Many in the group will lobby congress at the end of the ride, but all along the five day trip they will stop to talk to people all along the way at faith communities, at a homeless shelter, and a variety of other locations to talk about climate change. That action raises awareness, but just being involved in something makes you aware of efforts you may not otherwise know about.Look for smaller local policy initiatives. You can encourage your local leaders to back programs like setting goals to cut your citys emissions or by encouraging your city to purchase more electric vehicles and alternative fuel busses. Advocate for more green space and parks in your neighborhood. Sign up for a home energy visit. Like the one they have in Boston to find out how you can lower your own carbon emissions. Or do you own energy audit to figure out areas where you are losing energy, or where your home could be more efficient. Adopt a plant-based diet. Its good for the environment and can cut greenhouse gas emissions. If you cant give up your burger, try meatless Mondays.Cut down your carbon emissions. Walk or bike to work instead of driving.Reuse what you can. Bring reusable bags to the grocery store to cut down on plastic, bring a reusable mug to your favorite coffee shop to reduce the number of single-use plastic in your day. Bring silverware you can wash to work, rather than make repeated trips to the plastic utensil drawer.And by all means, stay informed, Clayton said. Dont avoid climate change stories, but dont wallow in misery, either. Staying informed is important because it makes it more concrete and less the scary monster under the bed, Clayton said. A monster under the bed is scary because you dont look at it; finding out about things makes them more manageable. For Petersen Boring, climate anxiety has changed what she teaches. She used to spend a week of class on sources of hope and talking about students grief. Now, shes developed two classes to address students emotional needs, including one that focuses on the inner life of an activist. Learning from activist movements like womens suffrage and civil rights, she tells students that they need to nurture their inner lives. To stay engaged, to keep buoyant and joyful, she says, one must acknowledge pain and loss and danger and keep the core values of courage, flexibility, resilience and compassion. So many adults tell young people that this is your problem, but I avoid that approach, she said. She doesnt want fear to paralyze them. Instead, I tell them this is our collective work to do.",07/05/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/07/health/climate-anxiety-eprise/index.html
"In a scary world, the biggest worry has to be climate change","In a world of troubles, the battle against climate change must take priority. That is the clear message of the 28 leading global think tanks that together comprise the Council of Councils (CoC). The CoCs 2018-2019 Report Card on International Cooperation, released today, designates global warming as the top international priority for the first time in the report cards five-year history. Alas, those same experts see little opportunity for progress in the coming year. Each year since 2015, the Council on Foreign Relations has asked the heads of CoC institutes to answer three questions: First, how would you grade international cooperation in the previous year, both overall and across 10 major issue areas? Second, how should world leaders prioritize these 10 global challenges? Third, which of these issues offer the most hope for progress in the coming year? This years results leave much to be desired. The world earned a gentlemans C for its overall performance. While this was a small improvement over last years discomfiting C minus, and the first time the grade had increased since the survey began, a little context puts the result into perspective. The passing mark came after a frightening 2017 that saw the United States and North Korea bandying about threats of nuclear war, underscoring the need for further improvement. International cooperation on individual issues areas was also mediocre. The highest individual grade, for promoting global health, was a B minus. The biggest disappointment was in mitigating climate change. Less than four years after the Paris Agreement, the Earth is poised to overshoot the 2 degrees Celsius rise in average temperatures that negotiators set as a fallback target. Moreover, recent reports on ocean warming, collapsing biodiversity, and natural disasters paint a dire picture of the planets future. Mitigating and adapting to climate change received a C in 2018. The world also earned lackluster marks on expanding global trade, improving cyber governance, stemming nuclear proliferation, and managing internal conflict. This uninspiring performance reflects the fraying international and domestic foundations of world order. Abroad, geopolitical tensions and regional rivalries are deepening. At home, surging populism, protectionism, and nationalism are reducing the appetite for compromise. But the biggest impediment to multilateral cooperation, most think-tank experts agree, is President Trumps America First agenda. By abdicating US global leadership, testing Western solidarity, and escalating trade tensions, the American President is undermining the legitimacy and stability of the existing multilateral system, contributing to the sense of a world adrift. The world has benefited for decades from an international order in which the rules of the road are well established and widely observed, explains Michael Fullilove, director of the Lowy Institute in Sydney, Australia. But increasingly those rules are under challenge, including by those who wrote them. The news isnt all bad. Faced with US retrenchment, the world muddles along. Other countries are prepared at times to advance cooperation. The European Union (EU) and Japan, for instance, are expanding global trade through new bilateral and regional agreements. China is advancing development with its (admittedly contentious) Belt and Road Initiative. The EU, meanwhile, is improving cyber governance through its General Data Protection Regulation. The CoC report card signals a shifting global agenda alongside this changing international landscape. Five years ago, think-tank leaders were preoccupied with combating terrorism and mitigating violent conflict. Today, they define the premier challenge as ecological: cooperating on climate change to ensure a sustainable environment for both nature and humanity. Their second priority is managing the global economy in the face of rising inequality, a situation underlined by the startling fact that the worlds richest 26 people own as much wealth as the bottom half of humanity (3.8 billion), according to Oxfam. Their third main concern is preserving the nuclear non-proliferation regime, at a time when existing treaties risk unraveling and North Korea is testing the worlds will. By contrast, terrorisms perceived importance has declined precipitously. This is partly a function of success: Counter-terrorism efforts, including the elimination of the Islamic State caliphate, have reduced the jihadist threat. No other international challenge has registered similar improvements in grades since 2015. Almost two decades after 9/11, terrorism seems less of an existential danger. The report cards biggest takeaway, perhaps, comes in its implications for the US. It underscores the shortcomings of Trumps transactional approach to foreign policy, as well as the costs of going it alone. Consider global trade. The Trump administration correctly identified market-distorting practices by China. Rather than rallying potential European (and other) allies, however, it alienated them by imposing discriminatory steel and aluminum tariffs. International politics, like nature, abhors a vacuum. The longer the United States remains on the sidelines, the greater the opportunities for other powers to take to the field and shape rules and global events to their advantage. Trumps decision to withdraw US troops from Syria empowers Russia and Iran in the region. As the US distances itself from international institutions such as the United Nations, China gains power and influence. What has been missing from Washington is any positive vision of a cooperative world order and a renewed US commitment to forging and defending its norms and principles.",07/05/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/07/opinions/cfr-climate-change-council-of-councils/index.html
How cities could help animals fleeing climate change,"As the world gets warmer, many species are clinging to survival by fleeing their natural habitats in search of new homes. A landmark report last week warned that human activity threatens one million species with extinction, and scientists say climate change is causing an unprecedented redistribution of species, with many land species moving on to cooler and higher environments. For conservationists trying to provide safe routes for animals to move from one habitat to another, our cities could provide a vital stepping stone on their journey, according to a report published today in the journal Ecology. Read: Climate change: Do you know the basics? The researchers compiled data from 70 studies covering 78 species (mostly insects, but also some mammals and birds) and found that in over 70% of cases, animals moved faster through lower-quality habitats. Low-quality habitats are essentially places where a species can survive, but dont have everything it needs to complete its life cycle. For a butterfly, that would be somewhere that provides food, but may not have the specific plants the butterfly lays its eggs on. For pollinators like butterflies and bees, cities and suburbs could fit the bill, as long as those environments include enough high-quality habitat where a species can successfully reproduce. And providing enough high-quality in habitat in cities could be as simple as us planting more flowers in our gardens. Read: Five things you can do to protect our insects from population collapse Lead study author Elizabeth Crone, a professor of biology at Tufts University, in Massachusetts, says that conservation planners often assume that the best way to help a species expand its range is to create corridors of its natural habitat. But her analysis shows that need not be the case. As a landscape planner, dont write off more developed areas, with the conservation potential of having more native plants in peoples yards and city parks and roadsides, she said. This reasoning is that when many animals are in a less favorable habitat, as long as they can still survive, they will move more quickly to the next breeding area. As well as analyzing previous studies, the researchers used mathematical models to calculate range expansion for the Baltimore checkerspot butterfly as a case study. They found that for it to move optimally through a landscape to expand its range there should be about 15% high-quality habitat  meadows and grassland  and 85% low-quality habitat  like hayfields. But with enough people helping out, residential areas could potentially make an effective substitute for hayfields. Read: Bengal tigers could vanish from one of their final strongholds If everyone in my neighborhood takes 15% of their yard and makes it a butterfly garden, including the particular host plant for the Baltimore checkerspot, weve created an ideal corridor for Baltimore checkerspots, said Crone. To help wildlife, residents dont even need to know what plants are favored by which butterflies. If people were to simply put their favorite native plants in their gardens, Crone says we could end up with certain gardens having plants needed by one particular butterfly species, and other gardens having the plants needed by another species. Together as a neighborhood you could have plenty of butterfly habitat, said Crone. Chris Thomas, a professor biology at the University of York, in the UK, cautions that it is still essential to maintain high-quality habitat in our landscapes, where species can reproduce. Ultimately youre still going to need lots of high-quality habitat in the landscape because these distribution changes are taking place over tens and eventually hundreds of generations. Its not all about movement of individuals, its about their reproductive success when they get anywhere, he told CNN. Read: Study suggests insect populations have declined by 75% over 3 decades The bottom line is you need both kinds of habitat  you do need things moving about if theyre going to track climate change and move through fragmented modern landscapes. On the other hand, you need high-quality breeding habitats if anything is going to move anywhere. Crone says the study has inspired her to think about how to make it easier for people to create wildlife-friendly gardens. Theres a few more steps before we can say definitely this is great, she added. Can butterflies fly over a parking lot safely? Are people using pesticide in their yards? But I think most likely with modest changes like using fewer pesticides, suburban landscapes can become really high-quality habitats.",15/05/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/14/world/climate-change-cities-animals-scn-intl/index.html
We have less time than you think to jump-start climate action,"On Friday, countless young people will flood the streets of the worlds major cities, demanding action to tackle climate change. The global movement stems from the stark reality that the window to addressing this emergency is closing. At the front of these demonstrations, there is frequently a banner warning that there are just 12 years to save the Earth. If political leaders finally respond to the climate crisis, we may well have these youthful advocates to thank. But there is a problem with this timeline: We dont have 12 years to jump-start action on climate change  we have just one. According to an article in the journal Nature, global greenhouse gas emissions must peak no later than next year and rapidly decline thereafter for us to have a good chance of preventing increasingly severe consequences from the climate crisis  everything from imperiled croplands, flooded communities and widespread disease. Delaying any longer will push us toward an ecological tipping point, with no way for humanity to claw its way back out. Next year is also a critical point because it is when country leaders agreed to put forward new climate plans when they adopted the Paris Agreement in 2015. They knew that the climate action commitments in Paris would not be enough, and so they agreed to come back in five years to step up their efforts. We will soon find out if prime ministers and presidents will stand by their word. Collectively, these revised plans will point humanity to a future that is either bright or bleak. Right now, the picture looks bleak. Deforestation is increasing, with 12 million hectares of tropical forest chopped down last year. Coal plants are still being built in at least 30 nations. Every year, countries prop up the coal, oil and gas industries with more than $5.2 trillion in subsidies, tax breaks and unaccounted costs of fossil fuel use in 2017. Ford sold nearly 1.1 million F-150 trucks last year (one every 29.3 seconds) even though the pickup gets a paltry 19 mpg. Earlier this month atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations hit 415 parts per million for the first time in human history; the last time levels were that high was during the Pliocene Epoch when there were trees at the South Pole and sea levels were 20 meters higher than they are now. I could go on. Clearly, the world is not yet making the urgent and unprecedented changes needed to halt global warming. In a landmark UN climate report released last year, scientists found that a global temperature rise of just 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) over preindustrial levels would greatly increase the risk of drought, floods and extreme heat, and food supplies would be in jeopardy even as the global population steadily rises. Every iota of warming leads to even more catastrophic consequences. No one expected the national climate plans submitted in 2015 to solve the problem. In fact, even if all the Paris commitments are realized, global temperatures would still be on track to rise 2.7 to 3.7 degrees C (4.9 to 6.7 degrees F) in the next century. Climate change is humanitys largest challenge; it would be sheer hubris to think we would fix it in one fell swoop. The beauty of the pact is that it calls for countries to come back to the table every five years  in 2020, 2025 and so on  with new plans informed by the latest advances in high-tech, science and shifting markets. Economic, technological and market trends since 2015 provide a compelling case for countries to strengthen their climate plans next year. And there are promising signs that industries are making environmentally friendly shifts. Renewable energy is now cheaper than fossil fuels nearly everywhere and accounts for nearly two-thirds of new electricity capacity. More affordable energy-storage options are making wind and solar attractive options, even when the wind doesnt blow and the sun sets. Plummeting battery prices are expected to make electric cars cheaper than gas cars just three years from now. And the F-150 pickup? Ford is planning for it to go electric, too. The rapid decline of the internal combustion engine  and how quickly leading car manufacturers have committed to clean solutions  caught everyone by surprise. Other major companies are also shifting their business models to seize the opportunities of the zero-carbon transition, with more than 550 businesses setting or committing to set bold emission reduction targets informed by climate science. And in recent years the very concept of climate action has shifted from a potential burden to a major economic opportunity as countries compete in the race for the $26 trillion in benefits from bold climate action between now and 2030. To prepare for the major moment of truth in 2020, world leaders are gathering at the UN Climate Action Summit in September in New York. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has set a clear benchmark for success by challenging countries to present concrete plans to strengthen their climate commitments and make them compatible with the Paris goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees C. This summit is a wake-up call for heads of state, ministers, mayors and business leaders to get ready to up their game. It is also an opportunity to show the rising generation of climate activists such as Greta Thunberg how  this time  world leaders will keep their promises. Now is the time to jump-start climate action and get on a path to a brighter future.

UK and Trump miles apart on climate change,"Fresh from the latest disasters on Brexit, surely the last thing the UK needs is a state visit from the worlds provocateur-in-chief, Donald Trump. Trumps position on Brexit  bring it on  may be divisive, but his denialist and pro-coal view on global heating and the climate crisis is even more extreme and makes him particularly unwelcome at this moment in Britain. The British parliament declared a climate emergency in May, while a day later the governments chief advisory committee on climate change recommended that the UK should aim to cut its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. During the previous month, protesters from Extinction Rebellion took over strategic points in central London for several days to demand even tougher action to combat the climate crisis. A simultaneous visit by the teenage Swedish climate school striker Greta Thunberg saw politicians from across the political spectrum vying to declare their support. As part of the global climate school strike movement, the UK has now seen several day-long protests by tens of thousands of schoolchildren, who argue convincingly that their futures are imperiled by the worlds dithering in the face of the climate emergency. Donald Trump, on the other hand, mocks renewable energy, brags about the US once again being the worlds largest producer of oil, and tries to resuscitate Americas ailing coal industry. His decision to pull the US out of the Paris climate accords left America embarrassingly isolated. Even the last hold-out  war-torn Syria  decided to sign the agreement in November 2017, leaving Trumps America in a minority of one. For this and numerous reasons, Trumps visit to the UK is embarrassing for almost everyone. While the US is politically divided on climate change, with Democrats overwhelmingly supporting climate action and some Republicans turning climate denialism into an article of faith the UK is very different. Here the 2008 Climate Change Act was passed with cross-party support, with only five of the more than 600 members of the House of Commons voting against. The Conservative environment minister Michael Gove has met Extinction Rebellion protesters and praised Greta Thunberg after her speech in Parliament, saying her voice has been heard and admitting a sense of responsibility and guilt over inadequate climate action so far. Gove  who has declared himself a candidate to replace the outgoing Theresa May as leader of the Conservative Party and therefore Prime Minister  has no interest in cozying up to Donald Trump. Theresa May can be seen with Trump without facing consequences, but only because her political career is already over. Nor will anyone on the opposition Labour Party side want to stand too close to the American leader during any official business. The Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has already declined an invitation to the state banquet with Trump, and has argued that it is wrong to roll out the red carpet for a president who uses racist and misogynist rhetoric. Corbyn was also the original proponent of the climate emergency declaration, stating that by becoming the first parliament in the world to declare a climate emergency we could set off a wave of action from parliaments and governments around the world. Needless to say, any wave of action on climate change would have no impact on Washington DC so long as Donald Trump remains president. While the Queen will no doubt remain dutifully tight-lipped there can be little doubt that Prince Charles and his sons will all be dreading the time they must spend with Trump. Charles has long been an avowed environmentalist, while Prince William joined broadcaster David Attenborough on stage at Davos in January to discuss the urgency of the climate crisis. Last time Trump visited the UK he was met by tens of thousands of protestors, many of them motivated by concerns about global heating and furious at Trumps climate denialist position. Whether as many turn up for his state visit on 3 June remains to be seen. Perhaps a more muted response would be a good thing  for if we know one thing about Trump, it is that above all else he hates to be ignored. But the fact remains that no other country, despite initial wobbles from both Brazil and Australia, has joined the US in withdrawing from the Paris climate accord. With the rapid developments in clean energy, batteries, and electric cars, Trump is looking not just out of fashion but out of date.",02/06/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/06/02/opinions/trump-uk-climate-change-backlash-intl/index.html
Climate change is seriously threatening human health,"Extreme heat and more frequent floods increase the risk of diseases and injuries, according to scientists. Warmer temperatures are already triggering serious mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression. A zero-carbon economy could prevent several hundred thousand premature deaths, experts said. Climate change poses a major threat to human health and is already having global impact by spreading infectious diseases and exacerbating mental health problems, experts warned Tuesday. It is well known that rising temperatures are triggering more extreme weather events around the world. But extreme heat and more frequent floods also increase the risk of diseases and injuries, according to 29 experts who form the European Academies Science Advisory Council (EASAC). Climate change is already contributing to the burden of disease and premature mortality. Without prompt and effective action, the problems are forecast to worsen considerably, the council said in a report. This report adds weight to existing research that shows we are living in a time when climate change is impacting human health. According to EASAC, climate changes effects include: Read more: What is climate change? Your questions answered UN climate scientists have warned that the world only has until 2030 to stem catastrophic levels of global warming, when temperatures are projected to reach the crucial threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. If global temperatures reach this threshold, an estimated 350 million people worldwide would be exposed to extreme heat stress sufficient to greatly reduce their labor productivity during the hottest months of the year, according to EASAC. Read more: Climate anxiety is real, but there is something you can do about it In November, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared climate change a health emergency after a report by The Lancet warned that a rapidly changing climate has dire implications for every aspect of human life. Tackling climate change could save millions of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars by mid-century, according to a WHO report published in December. EASAC came to a similar conclusion. Several hundred thousand premature deaths annually in the EU could be averted by a zero-carbon economy through reduced air pollution, according to Dr Robin Fears, program director of EASAC Biosciences. Fears said governments top priority should be to curb greenhouse gas emissions and reduce fossil fuel combustion. Another effective solution is for governments to promote healthier, more sustainable diets which will lower agricultures contribution to greenhouse gas emissions, he added. Last month, climate experts urged the UK government to slash greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. If adopted, the target would be the most ambitious emissions reduction goal set by any large economy.",04/06/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/06/04/health/climate-change-threatening-human-health-scli-intl/index.html
Climate change could pose ?xistential threat?by 2050: report,"Twenty days of lethal heat per year. Collapsed ecosystems. And more than 1 billion people displaced. Those are all probable scenarios that could devastate societies by 2050 if swift and dramatic action isnt taken to curb climate change, according to a think tank report backed by a former Australian military chief. The paper, by the Melbourne-based Breakthrough National Center for Climate Restoration, is not a scientific study, but an attempt to model future scenarios based on existing research. It paints a bleak future in which more than a billion people are displaced, food production drops off and some of the worlds most populous cities are left partially abandoned. Its foreword is written by Chris Barrie, a retired admiral and former head of the Australian Defense Force, who said that after nuclear war, human-induced global warming is the greatest threat to human life on the planet. A doomsday future is not inevitable, he notes. But without immediate drastic action our prospects are poor. Andrew King, a climate science lecturer at the University of Melbourne who was not involved in the report, said its findings were plausible, although he did not expect human civilization to end in 2050. Without a doubt (climate change) is a huge threat to human civilization, he said. Its the details that we need to pin down. King said that while he expected all of the issues mentioned in the paper to be occurring by 2050  such as displacement of people and food shortages  it remained to be seen how widespread they would be. He noted that there were many factors aside from climate change that could have an impact on global security and how humans react to altered conditions, such as population growth and inter-governmental action. The future predicted by the report is one of potential global catastrophe. Authors David Spratt and Ian Dunlop, both longtime climate researchers, warn that climate change at present poses a near-to-mid-term existential threat to human civilization. They drew on existing scientific research and scenario planning to forecast that if global temperatures rise 3 degrees Celsius by 2050, 55% of the worlds population across 35% of its land area would experience more than 20 days of lethal heat per year, beyond the threshold of human survivability. In that scenario, many ecosystems  including those in the Arctic, the Amazon rainforest and the coral reef systems  would collapse. Across West Africa, tropical South America, the Middle East and Southeast Asia, there would be more than 100 days a year of deadly heat, leading to over 1 billion people being displaced. Food production would drop off due to the catastrophic decline in insect populations, weather too hot for humans to survive in significant food-growing areas and chronic water shortages. With not enough food for the worlds population, prices would skyrocket, the papers authors argue. Rising sea levels would cause people to abandon parts of Mumbai, Jakarta, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Ho Chi Minh City, Shanghai, Bangkok and Manila, among other cities. Around 15 million people in Bangladesh would be displaced. The social consequences range from increased religious fervor to outright chaos, the paper said. In this scenario, climate change provokes a permanent shift in the relationship of humankind to nature. The latest report is not the first time researchers have warned of major social problems. In March, a landmark United Nations paper found that humankinds window for action was closing fast. The UN said that  under a business-as-usual scenario  millions of premature deaths could be expected due to air pollution, mass species extinction affecting the ability to meet human food and resource needs, and freshwater pollutants making antimicrobial-resistant infections a major cause of death by 2050. In May, IPBES, a UN-affiliated climate research group, released a damning report on global biodiversity, which found that 75% of the planets land surface has been significantly altered and 1 million species already face extinction. Another report out this week, from environmental risk management firm CDP, warned that the worlds biggest companies could face up to $1 trillion in losses due to climate change. The goalposts for climate action have never been clearer for companies, Nicolette Bartlett, CDPs director of climate change, said in a statement, warning that many costs could kick in within the next five years.",04/06/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/06/04/health/climate-change-existential-threat-report-intl/index.html
Climate change will cost companies $1 trillion. It also means huge opportunities,"Climate change is likely to cost the worlds largest public companies nearly $1 trillion over the next five years. But the opportunities for new products and services to reduce environmental damage could be worth much more. A survey published Tuesday by the charity CDP suggest that growing demand for low-emission products and shifts in consumer preferences could generate over $2 trillion for leading businesses. CDP, which was formerly called the Carbon Disclosure Project, said that nearly 7,000 companies including Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), JP Morgan Chase (JPM) and Visa (V) responded to its 2018 survey. The results show that while 80% of the largest companies expect climate change to result in major changes including extreme weather patterns, some firms have not yet studied the issue closely. Our collective response to climate change is more urgent than ever, and it is clear that corporate action cannot be delayed, Nicolette Bartlett, director of climate change at CDP, said in a statement. It is hugely encouraging that companies are reporting that the potential value of climate opportunities far outweigh the costs, she added. CDP encourages companies and governments to disclose information related to climate change. Its part of a coalition of advocacy groups and investors that have been pushing companies to reduce greenhouse emissions. Some 215 of the worlds largest public companies responded to the groups survey questions on financial risks, identifying $970 billion in potential costs including asset write offs. Meanwhile, 225 large firms reported business opportunities related to climate worth $2.1 trillion. Nearly all of the opportunities for new revenues, including electric vehicles and renewable energy, were described as highly likely or virtually certain. The gap between costs and opportunities means that investors should expect a significant shift in climate-friendly products and services from the worlds largest companies, according to CDP. Financial services companies reported the largest costs (including to their clients) and opportunities, a trend that Bartlett attributed to increased awareness caused by scrutiny from regulators and stakeholders. The potential gaps in awareness and disclosure elsewhere in the economy present real risks, she said. Regulators and investors should take note, and all companies from all industries need to step up. Pressure has been mounting on large public companies to do more on climate change following the publication last year of a landmark report by the United Nations. The UN report warned that the world has only 12 years to avert a climate disaster and called for rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society.",04/06/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/06/04/business/climate-change-cost-companies/index.html
NASA chief ?volved?on climate science; skeptics emailed to complain,"Prominent climate change skeptics, including one who now advises the Trump White House, sent NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine a chain of emails last year blasting his evolving views on climate change and humanitys role in it. Bridenstine was copied on the emails, where it was suggested he sidestep the climate issue in the future. I fully believe and know that the climate is changing. I also know that we, human beings, are contributing to it in a major way, Bridenstine said a May 2018 meeting with NASA employees. President Donald Trump has described climate change as a hoax and the administration has sought to roll back regulations of greenhouse gases. Man-made increases of those gases are causing a rise in global temperatures and associated impacts such as sea-level rise. [H]ow Bridenstein (sic) or anyone else can say that humans are a major cause of warming is a puzzle to me, the email chain between William Happer, who now counsels national security adviser John Bolton on climate change issues, and Thomas Wysmuller of the conservative Heartland Institute, states. The emails from May 2018 were obtained by the Environmental Defense Fund through the Freedom of Information Act and first reported by the Associated Press. The documents released Friday do not show Bridenstine engaging in the conversation. Happer joined the White House in September 2018. As a congressman from Oklahoma, Bridenstine claimed in 2013 that global temperatures had stopped rising 10 years ago and dismissed the Obama administrations spending on climate science. But as NASA administrator, Bridenstine acknowledged that his views on the topic have evolved. He endorsed the findings of the National Climate Assessment  which included contributions from his agency  and told Congress in May 2018 the report clearly stated it is extremely likely  is the language they use  that human activity is the dominant cause of global warming. In that town hall, Bridenstine was more specific, saying he has evolved. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. Were putting it into the atmosphere in volumes that we havent seen, and that greenhouse gas is warming the planet. That is absolutely happening, and we are responsible for it, he said. Happer, meanwhile, has previously compared the demonization of carbon dioxide to the Holocaust. The demonization of carbon dioxide is just like the demonization of the poor Jews under Hitler, Happer said on CNBC in 2014. Carbon dioxide is actually a benefit to the world, and so were the Jews. Happer wrote in the email that Bridenstines position is a puzzle to me. Catastrophic SLR [sea level rise] and runaway temperature rise is part of the nonsense, and he will be wise to systematically sidestep it for the short term, Happer wrote in the May 2018 email conversation. The emails from Happer and Wysmuller suggest they believe that the NASA head had entered a hornets nest without a smoke pot and I hope will methodically let the NASA hive settle down. Asked about the email, Jim Lakely of the Heartland Institute said, It is wrong to suggest that NASAs public statements on climate change are above criticism. Representatives from NASA and the National Security Council did not respond to requests for comment.",14/06/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/06/14/politics/nasa-climate-change-emails/index.html
What would life be like in a zero-carbon country?,"Drastic restrictions on almost every aspect of peoples lives, from the cars they drive, the way they heat their homes, to the fridges they buy  even the food stored in them. That is the reality of what awaits us in 2050 if a UK government pledge to cut greenhouse emissions to net zero is to be met. If it can do it, the country will become the worlds first major economy to stop contributing to climate change. But the goal is extremely ambitious  the roadblocks massive. Net zero means the amount of greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere is no more than the amount taken out. By setting the target, the government is doing what it promised to do. Under the 2015 Paris Climate Accord, the UK and almost 200 other countries pledged to work together to keep global warming in check. The agreement seeks to keep temperatures to 1.5 degree or at the very least to well below 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels. Cutting emissions is a non-negotiable part of that plan. To keep the warming under 1.5 degrees, global carbon emissions need to reach net zero by 2050. For the well below 2 degrees scenario, the deadline moves back to 2070. That puts the UK at the more ambitious end of the range  and under pressure to deliver concrete policies very, very soon. The net zero target means the country must slash domestic emissions as much as it can. A report by the Committee on Climate Change, the advisory body that recommended the target, gives a glimpse of what that future will look like. Petrol and diesel vehicles will need to be phased out and replaced by electric or hydrogen powered ones by 2035. Consumption of beef, lamb and dairy must be cut by 20% by 2050. No houses built after 2025 will be connected to the gas grid. The owners of older buildings will need to switch their heating system to a low carbon one by around 2035. There are issues with the plan. Some sectors are more difficult, or even impossible, to rid of emissions. Agriculture is one example. The methane created by livestock is a much more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide ... so we will have to reduce meat consumption, but its unlikely that we will reduce livestock to zero, said Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, which is part of London School of Economics. Aviation and shipping are other sectors where low-carbon alternatives dont yet exist. They are quite high carbon sectors, they are rapidly growing, and the decarbonization pathway is more uncertain for them, said Barny Evans, renewable energy expert at WSP, a sustainability consultancy. Emissions that cant be cut, like the ones created by belching animals, must be offset for the country to reach the net zero target. Trees take carbon out of the atmosphere through photosynthesis, so planting more of them is one way to do this. But growing more trees is not always practical. Britain is a small island and space is limited, so the government wants the option of paying other countries to plant trees instead. Groups like Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth are sounding the alarm about that idea. They worry that being able to pay someone else to act could undermine UKs domestic efforts. This type of offsetting has a history of failure and is not, according the governments [own] climate advisers, cost efficient, said Doug Parr, the chief scientist at Greenpeace UK. Another way to offset emissions is by storing greenhouse gases underground or under the sea. But scientists are still figuring out how exactly to do that in a cost-effective and safe way. Reaching net zero will cost about 1 trillion ($1.3 trillion), a price that for some, is simply too much. One vocal critic is Danish political scientist Bjorn Lomborg, who called the net zero policy pointless because the UK is only responsible for around 1% of global emissions. He argues the cost of the plan will far exceed its benefits, and advocates for more investment into research and development instead. But for Ward, and an overwhelming majority of climate scientists and climate economists, the numbers do add up. The only reason why people think that cleaner living is more expensive is because they are forgetting about the hidden costs of our current reliance on fossil fuels, Ward said. People are paying for the impacts of climate change through increased risks of coastal flooding, increased risk of land flooding, increased risk of droughts, increased risk of heatwaves, he added. The investments required to get to net zero will be around 1% to 2% of GDP each year, according to the Climate Change Committee. But dealing with the consequences of unchecked warming  rising sea levels, for example  would be way more expensive, it said. There are also those who argue the UK and other countries should move much faster. Extinction Rebellion, which recently staged major protests in central London and pushed the UK parliament to declare a climate emergency, wants the net zero target to be set for 2025. Swedish schoolgirl and climate activist Greta Thunberg has been striking outside the Swedish Parliament every Friday precisely because she believes the Swedes, with their target of net zero by 2045, should move faster. She is also questioning the way reductions are calculated. While the urgency is undeniable, the Climate Change Committee and other experts say a quicker action could hurt the economy  and the people. I hope we can get to net zero earlier and I hope the Extinction Rebellion will continue to push for that, but weve got to do this whilst improving the quality of peoples lives, Ward said. We have more than 20 million homes in the UK that have gas central heating ... if you were to stop that now, rip up their gas central heating without knowing what you are going to replace it with, you will kill people. Because there will be people who will freeze to death, he added. There is a socio-economic and politic dimension to this. We need to make sure we all benefit, Evans added. Experts mostly welcomed the plan announced by Theresa May. But they were quick to point out that a sweeping announcement by an outgoing Prime Minister who has failed to deliver on her own promise to take the UK out of the European Union, and a complete transformation of one of the worlds biggest economies are two quite different things. Especially when the country is struggling to meet even its existing target of 80% reduction by 2050. The government has to recognize it needs to do more ... and whoever is prime minister must bring forward new policies that will strengthen the emission reductions, otherwise we wont get there, Ward said. Brexit is another major roadblock on the way to net zero. Apart from consuming the energy of government and paralyzing the parliament, Brexit could also cause a massive hit to the British economy. Most economists expect the UK to slump into recession if it crashes out of the EU without a deal. The decarbonization plan will only work if companies are willing to invest in innovation, and a struggling economy isnt the best environment to attract investors. But the public, at least in Britain, is becoming more aware of climate change  and the potentially damning consequences of failing to act on it. According to opinion polls by YouGov, the number of Brits who think the climate is among the top three most pressing issues the country is facing has been growing steadily. The trend was noticeable in recent European and local elections in which Green parties posted big gains. The UK has not suffered, in the same way as the United States, from any major party denying the science ... its not a question of whether we should act, its about the best way in which to act, Ward said.",16/06/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/06/16/uk/net-zero-emission-target-gbr-intl/index.html
"Climate change threatens nearly 40% of the world? primates, study says","As cyclones and droughts are expected to grow in frequency and intensity while global temperatures rise, humankinds closest relatives will become increasingly vulnerable to extinction, scientists say. At climate changes current pace, nearly 40% of the Earths primates will be threatened by the extreme weather events that accompany rising temperatures, a new study says. And with 60% of primate species already vulnerable to habitat loss and human activity, researchers are pleading that conservationists consider both human and climatic impacts in their efforts. In the study, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, researchers assessed the vulnerability of 607 primate species and subspecies with two sets of criteria: their intrinsic susceptibilities, or traits such as their body mass, the daily distance they travel and the number of individuals in their group, and their previous exposure to cyclones and droughts over the last 46 years. The study concluded that 16% of the worlds primates, located mostly in Madagascar, are susceptible to tropical cyclones and 22% across Malaysia, Sumatra and West Africa are threatened by drought. Species such as the ring-tailed lemur, Sumatran orangutan and black howler monkey have already seen their populations decimated by habitat loss. The hope is that with the identified hotspots across Asia, Africa and South America most vulnerable to extreme weather, local wildlife groups develop conservation plans that incorporate climatic threats, the studys authors wrote. Of all mammals exposed to droughts and tropical cyclones, primates have faced the bulk of them. And despite a high capacity to adapt, the rate of global temperature increases is quickly surpassing certain primates ability to cope, study author and conservation researcher Eric Ameca told CNN. Coupled with human impacts, were exacerbating the environmental disturbances, he said. Primates play a very critical role in their ecosystems and the economies of the countries they inhabit. But populations threatened by extreme weather have already been devastated by deforestation, palm oil farming and illegal hunting, so holistic conservation is crucial to protect their standing in the order of the natural world. We wont only lose our closest relatives in the tree of life, but tons of services to nature and human societies, Ameca said. Its impossible to predict exactly when extreme weather events will strike more frequently, he explained, but rising temperatures will likely bring with them more moisture in the atmosphere, more frequent, intense rainfall and a greater potential for destructive weather.",17/06/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/06/17/world/climate-change-40-percent-primates-trnd/index.html
Hundreds of climate protesters stage blockade in German coal mine,"Hundreds of climate change protesters broke into a huge open cast mine in western Germany Saturday to protest against the countrys ongoing dependence on fossil fuels. The activists, many dressed in white overalls, evaded police officers as they crossed fields and roads, before descending into the vast Garzweiler lignite mine, located south-west of Dusseldorf. The mine, which covers 48 square kilometers, is operated by German electricity giant RWE (Rheinisch-Westfalisches Elektrizitatswerk AG) and produces raw materials used in coal-fired power stations. Organized by the Ende Gelande (EG) alliance, a German environmental protest movement, the activists staged a blockade against the police, sitting down in the center of the mine, covered with reflective blankets to protect themselves from the sun. We still have hope, the door is still open to a future within the 1.5 degrees C limit, Sina Reisch, a spokeswoman for the EG alliance, said in a statement. But we will miss this last chance if we dont act immediately. Today, we set out with thousands of people towards a future without fossil fuels, without exploitation and without this destructive quest for infinite economic growth. Nike Malhaus, a fellow EG spokesman, added: Nothing less than our future is at stake. We will definitely not wait until 2038 to phase out coal, we are acting now. If we keep burning coal for another 20 years, it is impossible to stay within the 1.5 degrees C limit. Today we are taking the coal phase out into our own hands because the government is failing to protect the climate. The protesters were quickly surrounded by police and many were forcibly removed. Kathrin Henneberger, an EG representative, reported that the final protesters were removed from the mine Sunday morning. It will continue all over Europe this summer, she wrote on Twitter. Our resistance has only just begun. Saturdays protest came just a day after EG protesters blockaded the railway tracks leading to the Neurath power station, one of Germanys main coal-fired plants, halting the supply of coal. This weekend, we have completely shut down the CO2 source in Europe, the Rhineland lignite mining area, Henneberger wrote on Twitter. No coal train goes to the power plants anymore. No excavator works anymore in the opencast mines. It is amazing. Thanks to all the thousands of brave people. The Aachen Police force, which is responsible for the region in which the power plant is located, reported that individuals were detained during the blockade. They noted that protesters were given multiple opportunities to leave the tracks freely on being asked, but failed to comply with the order. The force also noted that a number of officers were injured as protesters attempted to break through police chains and avoid security measures. Saturdays blockade was not the first time that the EG alliance has staged large-scale protests; in October 2018, approximately 6,000 activists blocked the tracks leading to a coal mine near the Hambach forest for 24 hours. As many as 8,000 protesters also took to the streets Saturday in the town of Keyenberg, located next to the Garzweiler mine, which is threatened with destruction by plans to expand the mine. Despite Germanys decision to abandon nuclear energy following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear power plant disaster in Japan, coal still plays a central role in its energy mix. The government committed in January 2019 to close all of Germanys coal-fired power plants by 2038, but coal still accounted for around 40% of the countrys electricity in 2018.",23/06/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/06/23/europe/germany-climate-protest-garzweiler-coal-mine-intl-scli-grm/index.html
Mike Pence? unbelievable answer on whether climate change is a threat,"Sometimes you have to read something to believe it. Vice President Mike Pences pretzel-twisting when asked by CNNs Jake Tapper whether climate change is a threat to the United States is one of those times. Heres the back and forth  from State of the Union on Sunday. Its long but incredibly telling: TAPPER: But I want to ask you a question about climate change. The director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, said in a January report on worldwide threats that the climate emergency is  quote  likely to fuel competition for resources, economic distress and social discontent. It is a priority for the DNI, Coats. The EPA this week, however, rolled back part of President Obamas Clean Power Plan, letting states set their own limit for coal power plants emissions. Do you believe think human-induced climate emergency is a threat to the United States? PENCE: Well, what  what I will tell you is that we will always follow the science on that in this administration. TAPPER: The science says it is. PENCE: But what  but what we  but what we wont do  and the Clean Power Plan was all about that  was hamstringing energy in this country, raising the cost of utility rates for working families across this country... TAPPER: But is it a threat? PENCE: ... while other nations like China and India absolutely do nothing or make illusory promises decades down the road to deal with it. You know, the truth of the matter is, with the advent of natural gas, with the natural gas explosion that is developing... TAPPER: Yes. PENCE: ... with clean coal technology, were seeing  were seeing a significant reduction in carbon emissions all across this country. TAPPER: But is what people are calling a climate emergency, is it a threat? Do you think it is a threat, man-made climate emergency is a threat? PENCE: I think the answer to is going to be based upon the science. TAPPER: Well, the science says yes. PENCE: Well... TAPPER: Im asking you what you think. PENCE: There is many in the science that... TAPPER: The science community in your own administration, at NOAA... PENCE: I got it. TAPPER: ... at the DNI, they all say it is a threat. PENCE: I got it. Look, what the President... TAPPER: But you wont, for some reason. PENCE: ... has said, what we have said is that were not going to raise utility rates. Remember what President Obama said? TAPPER: But it is not a threat? PENCE: He said  he said  he had his climate change plan. He said it is necessarily going to cause utility rates to skyrocket, and that would force us into these green technologies. Now you have got Democrats all running for president that are running on a Green New Deal that would break this economy. TAPPER: OK. So you dont think it is a threat, is all Im saying? You dont think it is a threat? PENCE: I think were making great progress reducing carbon emissions, America has the cleanest air and water in the world. We will continue to use market forces... TAPPER: That is not true. We dont have the cleanest air and water in the world. We dont. And, scene. Lets start here: There is no real debate in the scientific community as to whether or not a) the climate is warming and b) this warming is well outside of past ups and downs in terms of temperature. This, from NASA, lays it all out in very clear terms: The planets average surface temperature has risen about 1.62 degrees Fahrenheit (0.9 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide and other human-made emissions into the atmosphere. Most of the warming occurred in the past 35 years, with the five warmest years on record taking place since 2010. Not only was 2016 the warmest year on record, but eight of the 12 months that make up the year  from January through September, with the exception of June  were the warmest on record for those respective months. Theres also very little debate about the broad  and potentially catastrophic  impacts from this warming. This, from the 4th National Climate Assessment, gets at that point: In the absence of significant global mitigation action and regional adaptation efforts, rising temperatures, sea level rise, and changes in extreme events are expected to increasingly disrupt and damage critical infrastructure and property, labor productivity, and the vitality of our communities. And, even within President Donald Trumps own administration  as Tapper notes  theres a belief that the effects of climate change are real and dangerous. In addition to comments made by Coats, the Pentagon released a 22-page report earlier this year in which it concluded that: The effects of a changing climate are a national security issue with potential impacts to DOD missions, operational plans and installations. All of these f-a-c-t-s make what Pence is arguing all the more ludicrous. If he is saying that we will always follow the science, then the conclusion is clear: The science says that we are in a close-to-crisis moment when it comes to climate change  and that if we dont begin to act, we may find ourselves in a situation where the consequences are irreversible. But, Pence isnt really saying that the administration understands what the science says and will follow it. Instead, hes simply hiding behind a bunch of equivocations  the ridiculousness of which are laid bare by Tappers repeated fact-based pushback and the VPs anemic responses. Why? Simple. Trump has long been a prominent climate change skeptic  asking why, if global warming is real, then it is still cold out. Im not kidding  heres a tweet from Trump from January 2019: Be careful and try staying in your house. Large parts of the Country are suffering from tremendous amounts of snow and near record setting cold. Amazing how big this system is. Wouldnt be bad to have a little of that good old fashioned Global Warming right now! Pence knows that his path forward  in this administration or as a presidential candidate in his own right  is directly tied to Trump. Pleasing Trump. Ensuring that Trump knows he is a good soldier. And, if Pence said that climate change was a threat to the country, Trump would have seen it (or heard about it) and not been happy about it. So, Pence did what he did. And hed do it again.",24/06/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/06/24/politics/mike-pence-climate-crisis/index.html
America liquefied natural gas boom may be on a collision course with climate change,"Americas liquefied natural gas boom has a climate change problem, according to a report released on Monday. The US energy industry is scrambling to build dozens of expensive export terminals that can be used to ship cheap natural gas to China and other fast-growing economies that want to move away from coal. While those investments make sense today, they will likely be derailed in the longer run by a combination of plunging renewable energy costs and rising climate change concerns, according to the Global Energy Monitor, a network of researchers tracking fossil fuel projects. Those dual forces will make many LNG projects unprofitable in the long term, putting much of the $1.3 trillion of investments in the sector at risk, the report said. The problem is that the LNG boom will create harmful methane emissions  a greenhouse gas that is roughly 30 times more harmful than carbon dioxide emissions. Both coal and natural gas produce CO2 emissions, though natural gas creates far less than coal. If the proposed LNG expansion goes forward, the climate impact would be twice as damaging as the current installed base of coal in the United States, the Global Energy Monitor told CNN Business. We know that LNG is not a good answer climate-wise, Ted Nace, founder and director of the Global Energy Monitor, said in an interview. It might even be pretty foolish financially  for all the reasons that coal turned out to be a bad investment 10 years ago. Nace said that natural gas can no longer credibly be viewed as a bridge fuel between coal and renewables because of methane leaks. These accidental emissions occur during drilling, in the pipelines or during delivery. He said thats why the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has called for reducing natural gas in the coming decades in order to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. If you have leakage of methane along any step of the way, you can really undermine your case for this being a good solution carbon-wise, said Roman Kramarchuk, head of scenario policy and technology at S&P Global Platts. Kramarchuk said that there are still cases in which natural gas has clear environmental benefits as long as its pushing out coal and being produced and shipped safely. But renewables have become increasingly competitive on cost with coal and even natural gas. Plunging solar and wind costs have led major US companies to make large-scale purchases of renewable energy. Last week, Mondelez (MDLZ) announced plans to buy enough solar power to produce 10 billion Oreo cookies per year. Still, energy companies plan to spend about $507 billion in the United States alone on LNG import and export terminals, according to the Global Energy Monitor report. Thats the most in the world and nearly $100 billion above Canada, the next closest country. ExxonMobil (XOM) has partnered with Qatars state oil company on Golden Pass LNG, an export project located in Sabine Pass, Texas. That $10 billion project, which is scheduled for completion in 2024, is expected to eventually be able to export 16 million tons of LNG a year. Even Saudi Arabia wants to get a piece of Americas LNG boom. In May, state oil company Saudi Aramco announced a mega preliminary agreement to buy five million tons of LNG per year from a Port Arthur, Texas, export project thats under development. NextDecade (NEXT), Exxon and Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) are the top three owners of pre-construction and in-construction LNG terminals, according Global Energy Monitor. None of those companies responded to a request for comment. However, the American Petroleum Institute said in a statement that US natural gas and oil production has increased by 50% since 1990, while methane emissions are down 14%. The U.S. natural gas and oil industry is already driving emissions to 25-year lows  more than any nation on earth  made possible by the growing use of clean natural gas for power, the API said. The business group added, the U.S. and the world can continue that progress, meet record consumer energy demand, and protect the environment by investing in modern natural gas and oil infrastructure, and that includes infrastructure to export LNG. Building out LNG infrastructure requires very deep pockets. The cost of expanding LNG facilities is enormous  both in dollar terms as well as in time, Stewart Glickman, an analyst at CFRA Research, wrote in a recent report. Normally LNG projects dont go forward until they receive contractual backing for at least two-thirds of anticipated capacity, Glickman said. However, the industry is increasingly confident in the long-term future of LNG due to strong expected demand from China and other fast-growing economies. Glickman counted at least four major projects that have decided to go forward on-spec, meaning without that long-term contractual backing. That confidence may also stem from the enthusiastic backing of officials in Washington, DC, who see LNG as both a powerful economic and diplomatic tool. In May, the US Energy Department announced plans to boost LNG exports through the Freeport LNG project, which is being built off the coast of Texas. Not only did Energy Department Under Secretary Mark Menezes hail the project for being a source of clean energy, but he said its critical to spreading freedom gas throughout the world. Not surprisingly, Nace took issue with the freedom gas characterization. Its a little bit like the roadrunner going off the cliff and continuing to run, said Nace. These are very strong incumbent industries  and theyre not going to go away without a fight. Tellingly, billionaire Michael Bloomberg has expanded his own fight against climate change to include natural gas. Last month, Bloomberg launched Beyond Carbon, a $500 million investment aimed at not only accelerating coal plant retirements but working to prevent new construction of gas plants. Rather than fossil fuels like gas, Nace argued that the long-term growth opportunity will be solar, wind and other alternatives. This century will be owned economically by whoever manages to dominate renewables, he said.",01/07/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/07/01/business/lng-boom-environment-climate-change/index.html
"Climate change lawsuits spreading around the world, says report","Legal action on climate change has become a global phenomenon, with lawsuits launched against governments and corporate interests in 28 countries so far, according to new research published Thursday. A report from the Grantham Research Institute at the London School of Economics and Political Science looked at instances of legal action on climate change from 1990 to May 2019. Researchers found that while the US remains the global leader in terms of climate change litigation, the prevalence of such lawsuits has spread worldwide, according to a press release. This reflects an increasing willingness to use litigation as a tool to influence policy, according to the report, and human rights and science are playing an increasingly important role in these lawsuits. Since 2015, the first cases of climate change litigation were recorded in Colombia, Indonesia, Norway, Pakistan and South Africa, according to the report, titled Global trends in climate change litigation: 2019 snapshot. More and more countries, not only in the global north but in the global south, are bringing cases, report co-author Joana Setzer, research fellow at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, told CNN. Setzer emphasized that there could be many more cases that have been filed but not reported, and that she believes the number will continue to rise. We expect not only more cases but in different jurisdictions and using different strategies, she said. There were 1,023 climate change cases in the US for the period of the research, followed by 94 in Australia and 53 in the UK. Most of the litigation has targeted local and national governments, but companies have also been taken to court over failures to inform shareholders of the risks of climate change, or to incorporate climate change planning into decision making. Both businesses and governments have been taken to court accused of failing to protect people from climate change, or contributing to the problem. Outside the US, rulings have favored the fight against climate change 43% of the time, compared to 27% that hindered efforts. Others had no impact on existing policy or law. Previous research out of Columbia University revealed that 84% of climate-related lawsuits filed since the election of US President Donald Trump have had objectives supporting climate protection. Litigation is forcing judges to examine this issue and bringing science to court, said Setzer, who is also interested in how climate change lawsuits are raising awareness. I would like to see more research on the impact of litigation, she added. Businesses might not have previously considered a climate change lawsuit to be a risk, but they should now take this possibility into account, Setzer cautioned.",04/07/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/07/04/world/climate-change-lawsuits-scli-intl/index.html
Climate change isn? our only existential threat,"America confronts a long list of critical problems and they all require urgent attention. But among them, two issues stand out: catastrophic climate change and nuclear war are unique in the threat they pose to the very survival of human civilization. The enormity and imminence of these twin existential threats cannot be overstated and how to confront them must be the central issue of any presidential campaign. Climate change and the danger of nuclear war are closely related. As climate change progresses over the coming decades, large areas of the planet will be unable to support their human population. As a result, there will likely be forced migrations on a scale unknown in human history, and an enormously increased risk of conflict, including nuclear conflict. Nuclear war, should it come, would cause further catastrophic climate disruption and widespread global famine. Fortunately, there is a much greater focus on climate change in this election cycle than in 2016 when it received scant attention in the campaign despite the enormous differences in the policies espoused by the major candidates. This time around, the growing demand for action, especially by young people, and the daily reminders of the escalating damage to the planet, are forcing this issue to the fore where it rightly belongs. Progressives in Congress have put forward a comprehensive plan to deal with this crisis in the form of the Green New Deal, and there is the real possibility that a post-Trump administration will embrace this plan or some variant on it. Unfortunately, there is much less attention at this point in the campaign to the growing danger of nuclear war. That must change. Former Secretary of Defense William Perry has said that the danger of nuclear war is greater than it was during the Cold War, and the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists has set its iconic Doomsday Clock to 2 minutes to midnight, the closest it has been to a nuclear apocalypse since 1953, after the US tested the hydrogen bomb. Relations between the US and Russia are the worst they have been in three decades and the current tension is replete with nuclear saber-rattling from both sides. War between the nuclear superpowers is an ever-present threat. Furthermore, research done over the last 15 years has shown that even a very limited nuclear war, involving less than 0.5% of the worlds nuclear weapons, would be enough to cause catastrophic global climate disruption and a worldwide famine, putting up to 2 billion people at risk. Such a war would not necessarily involve the great powers. A war between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan could easily produce this level of global climate disruption. Even if none of the nine nuclear-armed states makes a deliberate decision to launch nuclear weapons, the possibility of an accidental war remains. There have been at least six episodes during the nuclear weapons era when either Moscow or Washington began the process of launching its nuclear weapons in the mistaken belief that it was already under attack. As Robert McNamara, President Kennedys defense secretary, famously stated, We lucked out. It was luck that prevented nuclear war. As long as they continue to maintain nuclear arsenals, the security policy of the nuclear-armed states is essentially a hope for continued good luck. The last time the world was this close to nuclear annihilation, in the 1980s, the need to prevent nuclear war was front and center in the nations political discourse. A vast popular movement formed that demanded and won a freeze in the nuclear arms race. The danger today demands a similar response, and this time the effort must focus on the complete elimination of nuclear weapons. A campaign to focus national attention on this issue has begun to take shape around the Back from the Brink platform, a Green New Deal for the nuclear threat. Supported by more than 200 professional associations, faith communities, peace and environmental groups, it has been endorsed unanimously by the US Conference of Mayors, and by the municipalities of Baltimore, Los Angeles and DC, as well as being approved overwhelmingly by the California and Oregon legislatures and the New Jersey General Assembly. In 2017, 122 nations voted to establish the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. The US boycotted those negotiations and has not yet signed the treaty. The Back from the Brink campaign calls on the United States to embrace the treaty and lead an international effort to prevent nuclear war. It specifically urges the US to enter now into negotiations with the other nuclear-armed states for a verifiable, enforceable, timebound plan to eliminate their nuclear arsenals as the only way to guarantee that they are never used. We cannot know for sure that we will be able to eliminate nuclear weapons; we do know what is likely to happen if we dont. The United States cannot afford to elect a good president in 2020. It must elect a great president, and at this moment in time, greatness means the ability to deal successfully with the danger posed by climate change and nuclear weapons.",06/07/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/07/06/opinions/nuclear-war-climate-change-2020-opinion-helfand/index.html
Miami Little Haiti wasn a target for developers. Until the seas started to rise.,"In a city where sunny day floods increased 400% in a decade, rising seas are changing the old real estate mantra of location, location, location. In Miami these days, its all about elevation, elevation, elevation. And long before melted ice caps wash over Ocean Drive, one of Americas most vulnerable big cities is becoming a test case for the modern problem of climate gentrification. While some scientific models predict enough polar ice melt to bring at least 10 feet of sea level rise to South Florida by 2100, just a modest 12 inches would make 15% of Miami uninhabitable, and much of that beachside property is among Americas most valuable. READ: Millions of US homes at risk of chronic flooding this century, study says Even now, as more frequent king tides bubble up through Floridas porous limestone, pushing fish through sewers and onto streets, residents are becoming more aware that their city is built on the rippling shelves, ridges and canyons of a fossil seabed. Water is simply going back to the same places it flowed ages ago, says Sam Purkis, Chair of the University of Miamis Geosciences Department. The irony is what happened 125,000 years ago is going to dictate what happens to your house now. The fickle undulations between city blocks could mean the difference between survival and retreat, and the rising cost of altitude is sparking a noticeable shift in community activism and municipal budgets. Neighbors in Pinecrest formed Americas first Underwater Homeowners Association (complete with elevation yard signs) and named a marine scientist as president. Miami Beach is spending millions elevating roads, upgrading pumps and changing building codes to allow residents to raise their mansions by five feet. But in working-class, immigrant neighborhoods like Little Haiti, year-to-year sea level rise gets lost in the day-to-day struggle, and most had no idea that they live a lofty three feet higher than the wealthy folks on Miami Beach. They found out when developers started calling, from everywhere. They were calling from China, from Venezuela. Coming here with cases of money! says Marleine Bastien, a community organizer and longtime resident. We used to think that the allure of Little Haiti was the fact that its close to downtown, close to both airports and close to the beach. Unbeknownst to us, its because we are positioned at a higher altitude. Pointing out a row of vacant shops, she ticks off the names of a dozen small business owners she says have been forced out by rising rents, and lists others who she says unwittingly took lowball offers with no understanding of Miamis housing crisis. If you sell your home in Little Haiti, you think that youre making a big deal, and its only after you sell, and then you realize, Oh, I cannot buy anywhere else. After her community center and day school were priced out of three different buildings, she caught wind of plans to build the sprawling $1 billion Magic City development on the edge of Little Haiti, featuring a promenade, high-end retail stores, high rise apartments and imagined by a consortium of local investors, including the founder of Cirque du Soleil. Magic City developers insist that they picked the site based on location, not elevation. They promised to preserve the soul of Little Haiti and give $31 million to the community for affordable housing and other programs, but it wasnt enough for Bastien. This is a plan to actually erase Little Haiti, she says. Because this is the one place where immigration and climate gentrification collide. She fought the development with all the protesters and hand-lettered signs she could muster, but after a debate that went until 1 a.m., commissioners approved the permit with a 3-0 vote at the end of June. The area we took was all industrial, says Max Sklar, VP with Plaza Equity Partners and a member of the development team. There was no real thriving economy around these warehouses or vacant land. And so our goal is to create that economy. Can we appease everybody? Not 100%, thats not feasible. Its not realistic. But weve listened to them. He repeats a promise to deliver $6 million to a Little Haiti community trust before ground is even broken and, as a sign that he listened to at least one demand, acknowledges that the complex will now be called Magic City Little Haiti. But while Bastien mourns the defeat, her neighbor and fellow organizer Leonie Hermantin welcomes the investment and hopes for the best. Even if Magic City did not come today, the pace of gentrification is so rapid that our people will not be able to afford homes here anyways, she says with a resigned head shake. Magic City is not the government. Affordable housing policies have to come from the government. (Climate gentrification) is something that we are very closely monitoring, Miami Mayor Francis Suarez tells me. But we havent seen any direct evidence of it yet. Suarez is the rare Republican who passionately argues for climate mitigation plans and helped champion the $400 million Miami Forever bond, approved by voters to fund action to protect the city from the ravages of higher seas and stronger storms. We actually created in our first tranche of Miami Forever, a sustainability fund for people to renovate their homes so that they can stay in their properties rather than having to sell their properties, he says. But that fund is a relatively small $15 million, not enough to dent a housing crisis that grows with each heat wave and hurricane, in a city where over a quarter of residents live below the poverty level. Whats happening in Little Haiti could be just one example of a climate apartheid that the United Nations warns is ahead, where there will be a gulf between the rich who can protect themselves from the impact of climate change and the poor who are left behind. Philip Alston, the UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, said there was already evidence of how the climate crisis affects the rich and poor differently. And he pointed out that those hurt most were likely those least responsible. Perversely, while people in poverty are responsible for just a fraction of global emissions, they will bear the brunt of climate change, and have the least capacity to protect themselves, Alston wrote last month.",11/07/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/07/11/us/miami-little-haiti-climate-gentrification-weir-wxc/index.html
How rich people could help save the planet from climate change,"Rich people dont just have bigger bank balances and more lavish lifestyles than the rest of us  they also have bigger carbon footprints. The more stuff you own, and the more you travel, the more fossils fuels are burned, and the more greenhouse gases are emitted into the atmosphere. Jetting around, buying luxury goods, keeping mansions warm and driving supercars  they all have a carbon footprint. Oxfam has estimated that the average carbon footprint of someone in the worlds richest 1% could be 175 times that of someone in the poorest 10%. Studies also show that the poor suffer the most from climate change. Read: While the rich world braces for future climate change, the poor world is already being devastated by it But some argue that the wealthy can do the most to help fix the climate crisis. Heres how they could make a difference. The buying decisions of the rich mean much more in the fight against climate change than those of most people. Ilona Otto and her colleagues at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research estimated that the typical super-rich household of two people (which they defined as having net assets of more than $1 million, excluding their main home) has a carbon footprint of 129 tons of CO2 a year. Thats around 65 tons of CO2 a year per person, which is over 10 times the global average. Otto noted that because the sample in the study was small, the numbers are illustrative. Probably our estimates are even lower than the true emissions of millionaires, she said. Regarding their own lifestyle choices, the rich can change a lot, said Otto. For instance, putting solar panels on the roofs of their houses. They can also afford electric cars and the best would be if they avoided flying. In the study, air travel accounted for more than half of the footprint of a super-rich couple. Read: Climate change: Do you know the basics? Rich people also have more flexibility to make changes. A high-income consumer likely has access and is able to afford more climate-friendly products or produce from local farmers, said Tom Bailey, who contributed to a new report that highlights consumption in high-income cities. High-income cities and high-income individuals also have the resources to trial new products, services and solutions, he explained, adding that they have the capacity to create a market for more sustainable goods. As well as choosing what to spend money on, rich people can choose what industries to invest in  or not to invest in. Oxfam estimates that the number of billionaires on the Forbes list with business interests in the fossil fuel sector rose from 54 in 2010 to 88 in 2015, and the size of their fortunes expanded from over $200 billion to more than $300 billion. But theres a trend of wealthy investors selling their shares in climate-harming industries, known as divestment. Over 1,100 organizations and 59,000 individuals, with combined assets totaling $8.8 trillion, have pledged to divest from fossil fuels through the online movement DivestInvest. Among them is Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio, who signed the pledge on behalf of himself and his environment foundation  as well as a group of 22 affluent individuals from the Netherlands who pledged to remove their personal wealth from the top 200 oil, gas and coal companies. Watch: Why climate change worries the worlds largest companies You dont invest in coal, you dont invest in oil, in gas, also in some car companies that produce normal cars, or aviation, so you direct the financial flows, said Otto. And with divestment, a little can go a long way. We did some simulations that shows that with the divestment movement you dont need everyone to divest, said Otto. If the minority of investors divest, the other investors will not invest in those fossil fuel assets because they will be afraid of losing money ... even if they have no environmental concerns. Wealthy people are not just economic decision makers, they can have political influence too. They can fund political parties and campaigns and have access to lawmakers. Otto argued that rich people could use their political power to instigate positive changes to climate policy. Those people with the highest emissions, they have the highest agency to change something, said Otto. Theres so much research about the poor, the impact of climate change on the poor ... sustainable development goals and so on. But when it comes to action and sustainability and transformation, the poor cannot do anything because they are busy surviving. But the educated, the rich and the super-rich  its a completely different case. They have the money and the resources to act and they also have the social networks, she explained. The wealthy can also support climate research. In 2015, Microsoft founder Bill Gates committed $2 billion of his fortune to fund research and development into clean energy. In May, a group of scientists wrote to 100 wealthy charities and families in the UK to ask for an extraordinary increase in funding for environmental and climate-related issues. We implore you to urgently consider significant investment to prevent further ecological catastrophe  whether through your personal investments or your philanthropy, the letter said. Theres plenty of incentive for the wealthy to demand climate action: A recent UN report warned that delaying climate policies will cost the worlds top companies $1.2 trillion over the next 15 years. The super-rich might also have an influence on other peoples carbon emissions. High status in our societies remains associated with high material wealth, said Otto. Its an aspiration to become like the very wealthy and you imitate the lifestyles of people who you want to be like. For example, air travel is no longer only a treat of the super-rich. This year, budget airline Ryanair was the only non-coal plant among Europes top 10 emitters. We as a society have to search for new ways of leading rich lives that are independent of material wealth, said Stephanie Moser, of the University of Bern, in Switzerland, who found that a persons carbon footprint is better indicated by their income than their environmental beliefs. We have to redefine wealth in our societies such that living a good life is possible without high greenhouse gas emissions, she said.",12/07/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/07/12/health/rich-people-climate-change-intl/index.html
California wildfires burn 500% more land because of climate change,"Climate change caused the increase in size of wildfires occurring across California in the last 50 years, according to a new study published in this weeks journal Earths Future. Since the early 1970s, California wildfires have increased in size by eight times, the study says, and the annual burned area has grown by nearly 500%. Human-caused warming has already significantly enhanced wildfire activity in California, particularly in the forests of the Sierra Nevada and North Coast, and will likely continue to do so in the coming decades, the authors of the paper wrote. Last year, for example, the Camp Fire claimed 85 lives in California, making it the deadliest in state history. Park Williams, the studys lead author and a professor at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University, told CNN that California citizens need to be prepared for continued increases in wildfire activity, and the risks to property and health that come with it. Williams said the assumption that wildfires would not affect modern society is proving to be wrong in many parts of the western United States. Increases in state-wide burned area over the last several decades were dramatically punctuated in 2017 and 2018 by particularly extreme wildfire activity with substantial loss of life and property, Williams said. In 2017, almost 1.25 million acres were burned in California. That year, the Tubbs fire alone destroyed more structures than any previous wildfire in the states history. One year later, the Mendocino Complex burned 459,000 acres, making it the states largest wildfire in acreage. The cause of that fire is still under investigation. In these two years, the state spent over $1.5 billion, more than any previous two year period, said the study. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection says 13 of the 20 largest fires occurred during the summer. All but one happened in the last five decades. The cause of the increase is simple. Hotter temperatures cause drier land, which causes a parched atmosphere. The clearest link between California wildfire and anthropogenic climate change thus far has been via warming-driven increases in atmospheric aridity, which works to dry fuels and promote summer forest fire, said the report. It is well established that warming promotes wildfire throughout the western US, particularly in forested regions, by enhancing atmospheric moisture demand and reducing summer soil moisture as snowpack declines. Williams told CNN that human-caused warming of the planet has caused the vapor pressure deficit to increase by 10% since the late 1800s, meaning that more evaporation is occurring. By 2060, he expects this effect to double. This is important because we have already seen a large change in California wildfire activity from the first 10%. Increasing the evaporation has exponential effects on wildfires, so the next 10% increase is likely to have even more potent effects, he said. Wildfires are not only common in the summer. In the fall, many California fires occur in coastal shrublands and are driven by extreme wind events, such as the Santa Ana and Diablo winds. These strong offshore winds have very low humidity, which quickly dry the vegetation on the ground and spread wildfires when they occur prior to the onset of the winter precipitation. For example, the Thomas fire in December 2017 was the states second largest wildfire in history. Fires in the fall are often driven by these strong winds, and while this study only focused on the increases in summer fires from increasing temperatures, climate models indicate their coverage will also become increasingly large in the decades to come.",17/07/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/07/16/us/climate-change-driving-california-wildfires-trnd-wxc/index.html
Record high temperatures far exceed record lows ?a trend of the climate crisis,"More than 400 locations across the United States reached record-breaking temperatures last week. During that same span, only about 100 areas saw record-breaking lows. While this 4-1 record ratio can mainly be attributed to this weeks heat wave, it doesnt stray too far from the 2-1 ratio of record highs and lows that weve seen over the past decade in the US. Weather variability can cause this ratio to change from year to year, such as in 2012, when record highs out numbered lows by a staggering 6-to-1  but the next year saw extreme highs and lows around the same pace. Record-high temperatures occurring twice as frequently as record lows directly reflects our climate crisis, as you would expect increasing the average temperature to increase the number of extreme highs, while extreme cold happens less frequently. Since our record-keeping began in 1895, the countrys average temperature has climbed somewhere between 1.3 and 1.9 degrees Fahrenheit. The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) recently conducted research into how this ratio should behave moving forward. We looked at a model simulation  where we were increasing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses going off into the 21st century  and as the climate continued to warm, the ratio continued to grow, said NCAR scientist Gerald Meehl. Current projections place that ratio as high as 20-to-1 by 2050 and 50-to-1 by the end of the century. If this ratio continues to grow over time, many temperatures we currently label as extreme may become nothing more than an ordinary occurrence. The same excessive heat warnings and advisories that affected nearly 200 million Americans this week would become more frequent and long-lived. Not only will this impact the elderly and young, who are already particularly vulnerable to heat-related illnesses, it will affect everyone. Heat-related illnesses would only continue to rise globally, with cases ranging from nausea to heatstroke  which claimed two lives during last weeks heat wave. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warns that the planet will reach the crucial threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels by as early as 2030, bringing with it the increased risk of extreme drought, wildfires, floods and food shortages for hundreds of millions of people. According to the Fourth National Climate Assessment for the US, the economic costs of climate change could reach hundreds of billions of dollars annually. The Southeast alone will probably lose over a half a billion labor hours by 2100 due to extreme heat.",22/07/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/07/22/us/climate-change-record-highs-outpace-lows/index.html
The cement industry produces more CO2 emissions than most countries. It may not survive,"Investors worried about climate change are warning the worlds biggest cement producers to reduce their emissions or face extinction. A group of investors that manages $2 trillion on Monday pressured cement makers to accelerate efforts to reduce their emissions. The coalition is made up of members of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change and Climate Action 100+, a leading campaign group with 320 supporters. Cement production, which uses huge amounts of heat and energy, is responsible for 7% of man-made carbon dioxide emissions. If the cement industry were a country, it would trail only the United States and China in emissions of the greenhouse gas. The cement sector needs to dramatically reduce the contribution it makes to climate change. Delaying or avoiding this challenge is not an option, Stephanie Pfeifer, CEO of IIGCC, said in a statement. This is ultimately a business-critical issue for the sector. Global investors are becoming more active in pushing companies to take meaningful actions to combat climate change. They have previously targeted oil and gas companies, extracting commitments from Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA). The latest call to action targets four major building materials companies based in Europe: CRH (CRH), Lafarge Holcim, Heidelberg Cement (HDELY) and Saint-Gobain. The investors want the cement producers to commit to being carbon neutral by 2050. They are also asking for improvements to corporate transparency, disclosure and oversight on climate change. The demands have been sent to board chairs at each of the four companies. The letters are signed by investors including BNP Paribas Asset Management and Aberdeen Standard Investments. Firms that dont move quickly to change their practices risk losing access to capital, according to the investors. With no clear single route to decarbonization, they recommend the companies pursue a range of options. Cement makers must get ahead of the profound transformation their sector faces by addressing barriers to decarbonization in the short- to medium-term, said Pfeifer, the IIGCC chief executive. According to the International Energy Agency, it will be difficult to reduce CO2 emissions from concrete while meeting demand for the material. Reduced demand from China is expected to be offset by expansion in other markets. The investors said Heidelberg Cement, a German multinational, has already committed to some key reforms. Heidelberg said in a statement that it takes societys concerns about climate protection very seriously and that cutting CO2 emissions is one of its top priorities. Swiss company Lafarge Holcim said in a statement that it is cognizant of the carbon footprint of cement and concrete and we are at the forefront of mitigating climate change. It also said it was exploring new technologies to reduce its carbon use. CRH and Saint-Gobain did not respond to requests for comment.",22/07/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/07/22/investing/cement-climate-change/index.html
Scientists say farmers could grow their way out of the climate crisis,"It is a brutal time to be an American farmer. Hammered by trade wars, a climate crisis and the worst income-to-debt ratio in a generation, calls to Farm Aid crisis lines have doubled in some states, and the website for Iowa corn growers now includes a page on suicide prevention. On top of this menu of misery comes the latest alarming report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, which finds that growing food around the world will only get harder as weather gets harsher and more unpredictable. But unlike those in the fossil fuel sector, farmers wouldnt have to switch careers to help save life as we know it. Since every plant, from redwoods to soybeans, moves heat-trapping carbon dioxide out of the air and into the ground, the right amount of innovation, conservation and financial motivation could help modern farmers keep the CO2 there while still making a living and feeding the world. We need to think about farming more than just producing food, fuel and fiber, but rather carbon management, says Gene Takle, emeritus professor at Iowa States Department of Agronomy. In the so-called IPCC Lands Report, more than 100 of the worlds top climate scientists find that almost three-quarters of the Earths ice-free surface has been paved, plowed or deforested. While this has supercharged global economies and lifted millions out of poverty and starvation in just a few generations, humanity is at risk of losing all those gains and more as temperatures rise at a speed unprecedented in human history. Vegetation loss, fire damage, coastal degradation, soil erosion, water instability and lower crop yields are among the Industrial Revolution side effects already being felt from India to Iowa. Justin Jordan strolls through his field of stunted cornstalks in Lacona, Iowa. Im looking at probably a 20-to-30% drop in yield just from the poor spring we had, he says. Normally, he plants his corn in mid-April, but freakish weather kept him waiting until mid-May, and just as the last seed was planted, it began raining. For two weeks. Still, he was spared the levee-bursting flooding that put hundreds of farms underwater, so he counts himself among the lucky. Ill be able to plant next year, Jordan says. Some of those guys, those fields are so damaged that theyre talking two, three years before theyre back in the fields planting again. Takle shakes his head as I relay the story. I contend theres no stronger urge to a farmer than to get that first seed in the ground in the spring, he says. And the fact that they wont be able to ... what is there to live for? As a co-author of the National Climate Assessment released on Black Friday, the veteran scientist points to projections that the number of days above 90 degrees Fahrenheit in Des Moines could jump from 17 to 70 by mid-century. But as the window closes on mankinds ability to slow the damage with a sustainability revolution, he points out that farmers could be key allies in the climate crisis fight. Take biochar, for example, he says, pointing to a jar of black dust that is charcoal made from organic material. You put that on the soil, its almost pure carbon, but it doesnt go back into the atmosphere. Itll stay in the soil for thousands of years. With all the diesel fuel, synthetic fertilizer and clear-cutting that goes into growing the modern meal, the IPCC Lands Report finds that almost a quarter of greenhouse gas pollution comes from agriculture, deforestation and land use. But there seems to be a quiet agriculture revolution going on, even among conservative farmers who bristle at the words man-made global warming. Well, theres 7 billion people in the world, about, and were bound to have some impact, says Ray Gaesser, a Republican who ran for Iowa secretary of agriculture in 2018 while farming more than 4,000 acres of row crops with his son. Even though he refuses to pin all the blame for 2019s 4-inch-an-hour rainstorms on human habits, he embraces wind energy, Earth-friendly cover crops and soil conservation. As we farm a little bit differently, as we sequester nutrients and carbon, were doing the right thing, he says. Thats what its about, is trying to do the right thing. We all want to do that, and it shouldnt be political. Hes also agreed to support Interfaith Power & Light, a national group that uses religion to address the climate crisis. The Iowa chapter is led by Matt Russell, appointed to a Department of Agriculture committee in the Obama administration, who operates Coyote Run Farm with his husband and two adopted sons. By gathering fellow farmers in church basements and appealing to their faith, he has cobbled together a bipartisan coalition held together by love of God and creation. Im not even worried about the hard-core skeptics, he says. Im engaged with those who arent skeptics but have never been invited into the conversation. Thats the tipping point. If he could wave a magic wand, he says hed have every 2020 candidate working on a plan to change the way farmers are incentivized. If big polluters will have to pay for every ton of carbon burned into the atmosphere, he thinks farmers should get paid for every ton they put in the ground. Thats whats emerging, and right now, were not even at the table, Russell says. So, were not going to get a penny if were not at the table. Full coverage: The climate crisis Just down the road, Jordan says that whatever reform emerges, he is all in. Hes taken advantage of a government plan that pays him to devote some of his land to wild prairie, a biodiversity boost that costs a bit in the short term but increases his yield in seasons to come. I at least tried, he says. Rather than just throw my hands in the air and say I gave up. I only have 410 acres, but Im willing to do the best I can with what I got. In the meantime, all he can do is wait, worry and pray for a late frost and a better future.",08/08/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/08/08/us/iowa-farmers-climate-change-weir-wxc/index.html
"Change food production and stop abusing land, major climate report warns","The IPCC report highlights the vicious cycle of climate change and land degradationLand use produces almost a quarter of the world's greenhouse gas emissionsTo stave off the worst effects of climate change, humans need to stop converting land Humans have damaged around a quarter of ice-free land on Earth, United Nations scientists warned in a major report Thursday, stressing that further degradation must be stopped to prevent catastrophic global warming. The warning comes almost a year after the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded in a landmark report that we only have until 2030 to drastically reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and prevent the planet from reaching the crucial threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The second IPCC report highlights the vicious cycle of climate change and land degradation. We humans affect more than 70% of ice-free land, a quarter of this land is degraded. The way we produce food and what we eat contributes to the loss of natural ecosystems and declining biodiversity, said Valerie Masson-Delmotte, co-chair of the IPCC. Climate change increases the frequency and intensity of droughts, flooding and heat waves, which can irreversibly destroy natural ecosystems and lead to food shortages. Deforestation and agriculture also fuel global warming, by weakening lands capacity to draw down carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and emitting vast amounts of greenhouse gases. When land is degraded, it reduces the soils ability to take up carbon and this exacerbates climate change. In turn, climate change exacerbates land degradation in many different ways. Today 500 million people live in areas that experience desertification, Masson-Delmotte said. Scientists say that we must immediately change the way we manage land, produce food and eat less meat in order to halt the climate crisis. But the report does offer hope, there are major opportunities to reverse the damage, the IPCC notes. Planting trees on farmland, known as agroforestry, better soil management and reducing food waste are win-win solutions which can boost land productivity and reduce emissions. Here are five key takeaways from the IPCC report: Human use takes up over 70% of the worlds ice-free land surface, according to the IPCC report. They degrade the planets natural resources, with chemical fertilizers, deforestation and intensive farming. In the process, humans have damaged two billion hectares of land, the size of South America. As a result, this land is less fertile and captures smaller quantities of carbon emissions from the atmosphere, according to Stephen Cornelius, the World Wildlife Funds (WWF) chief advisor on climate change. The way we use land is driving the climate crisis, he told CNN. Ecosystem conversion releases greenhouse gas emissions. Land use, including agriculture and deforestation, produces almost a quarter of the worlds greenhouse gas emissions. The IPCC report stresses that food waste and meat consumption will need to be reduced if we want to slash global emissions. Both are big contributors to global warming  with food waste producing between 8-10% and livestock 14.5% of global emissions, according to WWF. According to the report, 25-30% of all food produced is never eaten, while 821 million worldwide are undernourished. If food waste was a country, it would be the third largest emitter after the US and China, according to the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), a non-profit working to reduce global waste. The fact that more than one billion tonnes of food never gets consumed while one in nine people go to bed hungry is a travesty, said Claire Kneller, head of food at WRAP. If the United Nations goal of halving food waste by 2030 is to be met, countries should start measuring waste and adopt their own reduction goal, according to Kneller. We will not tackle the impact of climate change if we do not fix our global food system, she said. Forests and wetlands are important carbon sinks, but have been greatly diminished by human activities, the IPCC warns, and their ability to capture carbon could continue to decrease depending on human actions. Between 2007-2016, land removed 29% of total CO2 emissions from the atmosphere. Peatlands  a type of wetlands  can hold carbon for centuries, but more intense droughts, floods and wildfires could trigger the release of carbon from the soil. Sustainable soil management and agroforestry are key solutions that deliver carbon sequestration in soil or vegetation, the report notes. Land restoration represents a fantastic opportunity to draw down carbon from the atmosphere, Cornelius said. The food system is both a leading cause and a casualty of climate change, according to Joao Campari, who leads WWFs global food practice. Climate change increases the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as droughts and floods, which destroy crops and critical farming infrastructure. Read more: What is climate change? Your questions answered Its not just extreme weather that is threatening farming  climate change is also changing what types of crops can grow in certain locations by making it too hot or too dry. Campari told CNN the food system must urgently be reformed to avoid catastrophic global warming. Food production uses 34% of land worldwide and contributes up to 75% of deforestation, he said. To stave off the worst effects of climate change, humans need to stop converting land and destroying the soil with fertilizers and by cutting down trees, said Campari, adding that we already have enough farmland to feed the global population. In its report last year, the IPCC warned that keeping global temperatures at 1.5C above pre-industrial levels would require removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, using techniques such as Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS). But in its latest report, the IPCC said that quickly rolling out this technology on a large scale could greatly increase demand for land conversion. Ramping up bioenergy production through the use of fertilizers and irrigation could erode soil, increase water scarcity and threaten food security, the report notes. Claudia Ringler, deputy director at the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), told CNN that biofuels are not a scalable solution. The world would have to convert 7.2 million square kilometers, 45% of the Earths cropland, into bioenergy crops to keep global temperatures at 1.5C, according to the most energy-intensive scenario outlined in the 2018 IPCC report. Its not possible, not at the rate they are proposing, Ringler said, explaining that the conversion of this much land would lead to a huge spike in global food prices and drive insecurity.",08/08/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/08/08/world/ipcc-report-land-climate-crisis-sci-intl/index.html
"Greenhouse gases reach record levels, report finds","The dominant greenhouse gases released into the Earths atmosphere reached record levels in 2018, and their global warming power is now 43% stronger than in 1990, according to a new report by the American Meteorological Society released Monday. The State of the Climate in 2018 study also reported other key findings: Every year since the start of the 21st Century has been warmer than the 1981-2010 average, the report said. In 2018, the dominant greenhouse gases released into Earths atmosphere  carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide  continued to increase and reach new record highs. In fact, the report found greenhouse gases warming influence on the planet have increased an alarming 43% since 1990. Global carbon dioxide concentrations, which represent the bulk of the gases warming power, rose during 2018 to a record 407.4 parts per million, the study found. That is the highest in the modern instrumental record and in ice core records dating back 800,000 years, the report said. The report was led by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations Centers for Environmental Information and was based on contributions from more than 475 scientists from 57 countries. The annual report is often described by meteorologists as the annual physical of the climate system. Deke Arndt, one of the main authors and the chief of NOAAs Climate Monitoring Branch, said scientists over the last couple decades have gone through three stages of this annual physical of the climate system. It began with monitoring the temperature and anticipating related symptoms, like sea level rise and heavy precipitation. Then those related symptoms appeared, and we started anticipating costly impacts, he said. Now, those costly impacts have materialized, and the annual physical is forced to document some of those. Scientists used tens of thousands of measurements from multiple independent datasets to reach their findings. This is yet another in a series of expert, science-based reports that continue to sound the alarm about the climate crisis, said Marshall Shepherd, a professor of Geography and Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Georgia. He is also a former president of the American Meteorological Society. Shepherd went on to say that the DNA of climate change is clearly seen now in our weather, agriculture productivity, water supply challenges, public health, and even national security concerns. The findings from their State of the Climate report rises above some blog or opinion on social media, Shepherd said. Through the process of science, they are sounding an alarm about the here-and-now climate crises. The report adds to the growing list of studies about the alarming impact of global warming. One recent report from the United Nations found that food will become scarcer and that the climate crisis will change what kinds of crops farmers can grow. Another major US government report released last year gave a dire warning about climate change, saying the economy could lose hundreds of billions of dollars  or, in the worst-case scenario, more than 10% of its GDP. Mondays report found that global annual sea levels rose for the seventh consecutive year and hit a record high for the 26 years since satellite recordings began, having risen about 3.2 inches, or 81 millimeters, in that time above the 1993 average. The new high reflects an ongoing trend, the report said. Ongoing trends and year-to-year changes in sea level impact coastal communities by increasing the magnitude and frequency of positive sea level extremes that cause flooding and erosion. Global sea level has been rising at an average rate of 1.2 inches (3.1 centimeters) per decade. The report found that sea surface temperatures cooled since the record El Nino year of 2016, but was still far warmer than the 1981-2010 mean. The deeper ocean continues to warm year after year. For the seventh consecutive year, global annual mean sea level became the highest in the 26-year record, the report said. As anticipated in a warming climate, the hydrological cycle over the ocean is accelerating: dry regions are becoming drier and wet regions rainier. The report went on to say this about the warming trend: Along with warmer average conditions across the globe, there were more positive, and fewer negative, temperature extremes during 2018 than in nearly all the 68 previous years in the observational record. The study said a number of prolonged heat waves in North America, Europe, Australia, and East Asia were widely reported, along with some unusually cold periods, like the Beast from the East for example, in Europe. It is clear that lakes are also affected by the warm conditions, as the majority of the lakes assessed show continual increases in annual temperatures, especially in the northern mid-latitudes, the study said. The report also said preliminary data indicate that glaciers across the world continued to lose mass for the 30th consecutive year. For the 25 reporting glaciers, only one reported a positive mass balance for the year. Since 1980, the cumulative loss is the equivalent of slicing 24 meters (78.7 feet) off the top of the average glacier, the report said.

Black voters care about climate change too,"There are significant issues plaguing our nation, however, few carry the long-term impact of climate change. But when it comes to the voices leading this fight, those voices are rarely from the communities that disproportionately bear the burden of climate change, pollution, and our reliance on fossil fuels. Climate change should be a definitive issue for Black voters, but it isnt. That is partly because environmental advocacy groups have not always looked like us, nor have they clarified what solutions mean for our communities. And few have articulated what real environmental justice looks like. So, for any presidential hopeful that is serious about wooing Black voters in the South, take note: we expect a clear plan on how you will safeguard the air we breathe and the water we drink. We expect you to explain how climate change affects us, and how our communities will be spotlighted in response efforts. The pivotal battleground state of South Carolina offers a dark glimpse into our climate crisis. According to American Lung Associations Director of Advocacy, June Deen, South Carolina residents should be aware that were breathing unhealthy air, driven by extreme heat as a result of climate change, placing our health and lives at risk. And sadly, the water quality across the state is much worse. Earlier this year, a local South Carolina paper, citing state Department of Health and Environmental Control records, reported that 41 utility companies across the state surpassed federal safety standards for lead in the water. This is alarming, especially given the debilitating affect that even small amounts of lead can have on the developing brains of our children. Even though South Carolinas Department of Health and Environmental Control has expressed a desire to increase the fines against utilities for water quality violations, weve not seen the kind of decisive action from state government that would actually deliver clean water to rural communities across the state. This is personal for me because South Carolina is my home. And for a state that embraces the motto While I breathe, I hope, it is understandable why hope for some may seem unreachable when the air our children breathe and the water they drink makes them sick. And if the fight for clean air and water were not enough, battling the effects of climate change along the South Carolina coastline and incessant offshore drilling continue to worsen matters. But these grim environmental conditions are not unique to South Carolina. Many communities of color across the rural South can unfortunately relate. Yet, the Trump administration continues to turn back the clock on decades of environmental progress That is why increasing investments in renewable energy could have a transformative impact on rural communities. Not only will it preserve the health of our children, but clean energy has the power to improve economies and stimulate job growth in rural communities like those throughout South Carolina afflicted by high unemployment. Fortunately, House Democrats have a plan that puts us on a sustainable path toward a 100% clean energy economy. The 100% Clean Economy Act of 2019 builds on the progress of the Obama administration and leading states by setting a national goal to achieve a clean energy economy by 2050, and as a result, improving public health and environmental outcomes for rural and low-income households and communities of color. Fostering support for climate change will require advocates to make the environmental crisis plain in terms that resonate with frontline communities who bear the biggest burden of environmental racism. The work we are seeing from United for Climate and Environmental Justice Task Force, grassroots activists like Heather McTeer Toney, and organizations like We Act  all led by people of color  must be central to our efforts to promote voices of color on climate change. And lets continue to lift up efforts of climate activists and legislators of color and organizations like Denmark Citizens for Safe Water. (Im a member of the Denmark group.) Elevating the transformative work of these groups will create an inclusive movement that can help connect the dots on climate change for Black voters. I urge environmental activists and organizations of color to rally behind a 100% clean energy economy. This is the only way to diversify the politics of climate change and hasten our transition to a fairer and cleaner economy that puts our water, air, and children first.",15/08/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/08/15/opinions/black-voters-climate-change-2020-sellers/index.html
"Scientists bid farewell to the first Icelandic glacier lost to climate change. If more melt, it can be disastrous","Scientists say they are bidding farewell to Okjokull, the first Icelandic glacier lost to climate change, in a funeral of sorts. Researchers will gather Sunday in Borgarfjorur, Iceland, to memorialize Okjokull, known as Ok for short, after it lost its status as a glacier in 2014. The inscription, titled A letter to the future, on the monument paints a bleak picture. Ok is the first Icelandic glacier to lose its status as a glacier. In the next 200 years, all our glaciers are expected to follow the same path. This monument is to acknowledge that we know what is happening and know what needs to be done. Only you know if we did it, the plaque reads in English and Icelandic. From the ice sheet in Greenland to the towering glaciers in West Antarctica, Earths enormous masses of ice are melting fast. And though sea levels have risen and fallen throughout history, scientists say its never happened at a rate this fast. If glaciers continue to melt at the current rapid rate, it will pose a number of hazards for the planet, geologists say. Here are some of the potential hazards: By 2100, up to 2 billion people  or about a fifth of the worlds population  could be displaced from their homes and forced to move inland because of rising ocean levels, according to a 2017 study. Bangladesh is particularly at risk. About 15 million people in the country could become climate refugees if sea levels rise 1 meter, or about 3 feet. And more than 10% of the country would be underwater. Some of the people who are displaced might not have anywhere to go. Theyre not protected by international laws, so industrialized countries arent legally obligated to grant them asylum. If sea levels continue to rise at a rapid rate, some remote island nations would be at risk of disappearing, including Tuvalu, the Maldives and the Marshall Islands. Millions of people depend on glaciers for drinking water, particularly in the Hindu Kush Himalayan region and the Andes Mountains. In dry climates near mountains, glaciers collect precipitation and freshwater and store it as ice during colder months. When summer comes along, the ice melts and runs off into rivers and streams, providing drinking water. A world without glaciers would threaten that water supply and potentially have devastating effects, Jason Briner, a geologist at the University of Buffalo, told CNN. Melting glaciers also threaten the food supply. Rising sea levels contribute to warmer global temperatures, changing what kinds of crops farmers can grow. Some climates will become too hot for what farmers are growing now. Other climates will see more flooding, more snow or more moisture in the air, also limiting what can be grown. As a result, food will become scarcer, grocery prices will spike and crops will lose their nutritional value, as the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change noted in a report earlier this year. As sea levels rise, coastal communities are more susceptible to flooding. One particularly gross consequence of that flooding is the impact on sewage treatment plants, which are often built at low elevations close to the oceans. Floods can cause massive amounts of untreated sewage to flow into rivers, streams, streets and even homes. That pollutes sources of water, harms wildlife and helps spread diseases. A lot of times when people think about sea level rise, they think about inundation of land, Andrea Dutton, geology professor at the University of Florida, told CNN. They think that If my house isnt in the area thats flooded, I dont need to worry about it, which is a complete misconception. More than 90 percent of the worlds trade is carried by sea, according to the United Nations. So, theres a good chance that most of the things you buy have passed through at least two ports: one during export and one during import. Ports are critical to the global economy, providing jobs in industries like shipbuilding, fishing, seafood processing and marine transportation. Rising sea levels could damage the infrastructure of many ports and disrupt all kinds of processes, creating a ripple effect throughout the economy. [Melting glaciers] will affect peoples access to food, water and energy, which are fundamental, critical things that we need to survive, Dutton said. The large ice sheets in the Arctic and Antarctic are part of Earths energy balance, Briner said. Those massive white surfaces work to reflect rays from the sun back into the environment, keeping temperatures mild. As more and more glaciers melt, energy from the sun will instead be absorbed into the ocean. As the oceans get warmer, global temperatures become hotter and cause even more glaciers to melt. That creates a cycle that amplifies the climate crisis, Briner said.",18/08/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/08/18/health/glaciers-melting-climate-change-trnd/index.html
The science behind the climate crisis,"Not sure how we found ourselves in this climate crisis? Still on the fence about how much the planet is warming and how much of it is caused by humans? Here are the facts to get you up to speed before the CNN Climate Town Hall with 10 of the leading 2020 Democratic presidential candidates on Wednesday. Carbon dioxide is called a greenhouse gas because of its ability to trap solar radiation in the Earths atmosphere like a blanket and heat up the planet  acting the same way a greenhouse keeps plants warm and growing. All of this carbon dioxide is warming the planet. CO2 naturally occurs in the atmosphere and without it, the planet would be too cold to support life. But human activity, like the burning of fossil fuels for energy, has increased the gas to dangerous levels, increasing the thickness of that blanket to the point that the Earth is heating up. Before the Industrial Revolution, the levels fluctuated naturally over many thousands of years but had never exceeded 300 parts per million at any point in the last 800,000 years. In addition to the levels being higher than at any point in human history, the rate at which those levels have increased shows that humans are the cause. During natural variations in the distant past, carbon dioxide levels took thousands of years to change as much as humans have raised the levels in less than a century. The average global temperature is up nearly 2 degrees Fahrenheit. Scientists have been measuring temperatures around the globe reliably since about 1850 and several independent government and academic institutions  NOAA, NASA, Japan Meteorological Agency, the UK Met Office, among others  track this data to give us global average temperatures. The agencies use different methods and work separately, but all of these data sets tell us the same thing: Our planet is warming, and nearly every year is warmer than almost all the years before it. The past five years have been the five warmest years since 1850 and 18 of the hottest 19 years have occurred since 2001. The warming trend has rapidly increased since the 1970s. The average global temperature has risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit, or a little over 1 degree Celsius, since the 1880s. That puts us more than two-thirds of the way to the warming limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius that was set in the Paris climate agreement. While 2 degrees Fahrenheit might not sound like much, that difference throws a lot of Earths processes out of whack. Humans have thrived at a consistent global temperature, and now its changing. Think of your bodys temperature: When you have 100-degree fever or higher, it means something isnt right and it has an effect. Ice is disappearing from both poles at an increasing rate. Climate change is occurring the fastest in the Earths polar regions, where temperatures are rising more than twice as fast as the planet as a whole. This is causing major changes is the polar landscape  namely melting ice both in the oceans (sea ice) and the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica. With each decade, theres about 13% less ice cover. The volume of sea ice is less than half of what it was 20 years ago. The impact of the lack of ice is showing itself in places such as Alaska, where a lack of ice is leading to fish and animal die-offs and coastal flooding. According to NASA, Greenland is losing around 286 billion tons of ice volume per year, while Antarctica shreds about 127 billion tons of ice. Both ice sheets have shown increasing rates of ice loss over the past decade. According to scientists, the summer of 2019 is expected to set the record for the most ice-melt ever recorded over Greenland. Global Warning: Explore Greenlands ice melt The most widespread impact from climate change is rising sea levels around the globe. A combination of melting ice sheets, glaciers and an expansion of the water as it heats up has caused the global average sea level to rise by more than 8 inches since 1900, with almost half of that rise coming in the last 25 years. Projections show that oceans will rise on average by 1 to 4 feet across the globe by 2100, which would expose 30 to 60 million people worldwide to flooding, assuming we can keep global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. But we do not have to wait until 2100 to see the impacts of sea level rise. Communities in South Florida are already flooding many times per year during everyday high tides, and they are struggling with the costs to combat the rising tides. The worlds oceans are warming at an accelerated rate. The ocean is the memory of climate change  about 93% of the Earths energy imbalance ends up in the ocean. The oceans have experienced consistent changes since the late 1950s and have gotten a lot warmer since the 1960s, with 2018 being the warmest year on record, followed by 2017, then 2015. A warmer ocean brings deadly consequences. Warmer waters lead to an increase in rainfall, leading to longer-lasting and more intense storms, stronger hurricanes, dangerous coastal flooding and the loss of sea ice. If humans dont do anything to mitigate climate change, warming in the upper part of the ocean will be six times higher by 2081-2100 than total ocean warming in the past 60 years, researchers estimate. The climate crisis could halt and reverse progress made in human health over the past century, experts say. Rising global temperatures could lead to many more deaths than the 250,000 a year between 2030 and 2050 the World Health Organization predicted just five years ago. Higher temperatures bring more bug-borne diseases and cases of malaria, diarrhea, heat stress, heart defects and malnutrition. Food shortages could become a serious issue. About 1% of food calories have already been lost from global food production due to rising temperatures. That means a serious loss of food calories for about 50 million people. The rising CO2 levels have also had a negative impact on the nutritional value of certain crops such as rice, and the climate crisis has reduced crop yield. It has also negatively impacted floral development, meaning that the pollinators  bees and butterflies  that rely on that pollen are put in jeopardy by the climate crisis.",04/09/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/09/04/us/climate-change-science-101-basics/index.html
15 things a president can actually do to tackle the climate crisis,"Candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination and most scientists say the climate crisis is the existential threat of our time, while President Donald Trump once claimed its a hoax cooked up by the Chinese. Trump also said at last months G7 meeting that Im an environmentalist, citing his experience filing environmental impact statements as a businessperson, though he skipped an actual session about climate change that his fellow world leaders attended. That pretty much sums up the difference between how a Democrat would treat climate change compared with Trump: as an emergency as opposed to as a joke. That, in itself, would be an enormous switch. Watch CNNs climate crisis town hall with 2020 presidential candidates Wednesday. This is a worldwide issue, and solving it will take cooperation from countries like China and India. In addition, the most important actions the US could take would require congressional approval, no easy task when the Senate floor is controlled by a Republican who represents coal country. But presidents actually have quite a bit of power to change US climate policy on their own, without waiting for Congress. A first set of steps would be to roll back numerous Trump actions that either sidelined US leadership on the climate or rescinded new standards that had been implemented during the Obama administration. Related: 2020 candidates climate change positions CNN gathered input from advocacy groups, former government officials and academics. Here are some things any president could do on Day One in office: Promising to withdraw the US from the landmark 2015 climate agreement was Trumps benchmark action rebutting the responsibility to act on climate change. He said, without much evidence, that it was a demeaning failure for American workers, who would be expected to do more than those in other countries. The result is the US is one of just a few countries not taking part in the effort, in which nations committed to varying amounts of carbon reduction. Every candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination has said they would bring the US back in. The US was supposed to reduce carbon emissions by 26% from 2005 levels by 2025 under the agreement. It probably wont get there with the willful sabotage of the Trump administration. But with certain states, cities and companies trying to fill the void, the US could get most of the way there, according to groups like Americas Pledge, the coalition pushed by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former California Gov. Jerry Brown. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont was the first presidential candidate to argue that Trump, instead of declaring a national emergency at the border, should do it on the climate instead. Others, like Tom Steyer, have followed suit. This would certainly focus national attention and could free up some funds without congressional approval. The Pentagon has embraced renewable energy and efficiency in the name of defense strategy. But simply striking a tone of concern about climate change could do a lot to change the way the government operates. It would be a massive departure from the current situation, where the words climate change are scrubbed from reports and releases and the entire US government has pivoted to ignore that climate change exists. As the US government turns a blind eye, cities and states and other countries are taking matters into their own hands. New York, joining the United Kingdom and other nations and cities, declared a climate emergency and Los Angeles is creating a Climate Emergency Mobilization Department. The President could easily declare a goal of 100% decarbonization by a given year  say, 2050  and direct his or her Cabinet secretaries to do everything in their power to meet it. At the request of automakers, the Trump administration worked to roll back fuel economy standards for cars and trucks. A different President could push things again in the other direction. California has a waiver from a clause of the Clean Air Act that gives it special authority to set its own fuel economy standards. It negotiated increased fuel economy standards with four companies (Ford, Honda, Volkswagen and BMW) to meet a 51 mpg by 2026 standard. Since its the largest US auto market, theres a good chance other companies will follow suit and this will become the new de facto standard. But its not as strong as the 54.5 mpg standard set by the Obama administration, which a new administration could restore. Ten states have set full zero-emission goals for automobiles by 2030. Colorado became the latest in August. The federal government could follow suit or go even further. Calls for new infrastructure spending or a Green New Deal all share the goal of making US buildings more energy efficient. This sounds like a great idea, but even the smallest standard can spark a huge backlash, as Obama found regarding incandescent light bulbs in 2011. The country has since moved farther away from them. The Trump administration is relaxing standards for light bulbs. Trump also tried to cut funding for energy efficiency research at the Department of Energy. And his Department of Energy wants to let manufacturers skirt energy efficiency tests. Trump actually signed an executive order intended to make federal buildings more efficient. But that is a small portion of the buildings in the country. Pushing efficiency standards on a larger scale would help cut down on emissions. The Clean Power Plan was an Obama-era regulatory scheme that required states to meet specific carbon emission-reduction standards based on their individual energy consumption. The plan includes an incentive program for states to get a head start on meeting standards on early deployment of renewable energy and low-income energy efficiency. The Trump administration, under former Environmental Protection Agency Director Scott Pruitt, found that the plan exceeded a presidents authority and reversed it. A coalition of states are suing the government to stop some of these regulatory rollbacks. Trump is extremely proud that the United States now produces more oil and natural gas than any other country on Earth, although it reached that threshold during the Obama administration. Hes rolled back safety regulations for oil and gas producers, used executive action to make it much easier to approve pipelines and given the federal government more power over states that might try to block them under the Clean Water Act. Workers in the Bureau of Land Management worked through the partial government shutdown early this year to approve more and more applications for oil and natural gas drilling on public lands. A new administration could move in the opposite direction. Trump reversed an Obama-era moratorium on new leases of public land for coal development. His administration argued this year that new coal coming from public lands would not affect US greenhouse gas emissions. A large percentage  40%, according to the federal government  of the coal mined in the US comes from public lands. One Trump administration effort to bail out the coal industry has already failed and there are reports that the administration holds out hope to try again. Trump made a campaign pledge to focus on coal and to help save coal jobs. That hasnt gone according to plan, as market forces and cheaper natural gas and renewable plants have pushed the coal industry to the brink. Trumps EPA tried to help the coal industry when it rolled back new emission rules for coal plants, but that faces a challenge by 22 states, who point to provisions of the Clean Air Act. While he has mocked the idea of offshore wind turbines, Trump has pushed offshore oil rigs. His administration upset decades of precedent when it pushed for new drilling on every coast of the US, although it exempted some states, such as Florida, where he owns beachfront property. The administration appears for now to have put the plan on hold after it suffered some trouble in court, when a federal judge in Alaska froze plans for new drilling in the Arctic Ocean. While the Trump administration has pushed oil and gas exploration on public lands, there are proposals in Congress to use public land, particularly in the Southwest, for renewable energy production in the form of wind or solar farms. The Obama administration had a rule that would have moved in that direction without congressional approval. Most attention for climate change goes to the energy sector, but banks and investors have an important role too. The Securities and Exchange Commission asks companies what risks climate change and new climate change regulations pose to their investments. As the world transitions away from oil and natural gas, companies in that industry and reliant on it will face challenges and may need to adapt. The president could direct the SEC to require more serious answers. Several presidential candidates have endorsed this move. States and cities are addressing climate change, be it with zero-emission-vehicle goals or the regional cooperative of states in the Northeast that is trying to cap and reduce carbon emissions on its own. Corporate America is also moving on its own. Its setting up coalitions of companies and lobbying Congress for new action on climate change. As it stands right now, the federal government is not even a part of that conversation. Pretty much everyone who agrees that climate change is a problem agrees that Congress will ultimately have to address it in a big way. That means placing some kind of price on carbon. The House voted to do this in 2010, but the so-called cap-and-trade proposal didnt get a vote in the Senate and then Democrats lost control of the House for eight years. Calls by Democratic candidates for a Green New Deal that would rebuild the US economy around a mobilization away from carbon or a multitrillion-dollar infrastructure investment to make the country more efficient would require congressional approval, which may not come. Any such action might, in the near term, require ending the filibuster custom in the Senate.",04/09/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/09/04/politics/presidents-power-day-one-climate-change/index.html
The growing power and anger of climate change voters,"The voter passionately motivated by climate change was once something of an anomaly. But that is changing as President Donald Trump has systematically unraveled the nations environmental regulations at the same time that Americans have witnessed a series of climate-related crises: fires in the Amazon, hurricanes that churn with increasing fury and record-shattering temperatures and weather events across the US. For the first time in any presidential cycle, Democrats had a mainstream candidate  in Washington Gov. Jay Inslee  who ran a campaign centered on climate change. Since Inslee dropped out last month, his former rivals have vowed to pick up his mantle  with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren literally adopting Inslees climate change plan as her own as she and nine other candidates prepared for CNNs town hall solely focused on the climate crisis. Climate change got little attention in the 2016 presidential campaign. But there was a notable shift during the 2018 midterm election, said Tiernan Sittenfeld, senior vice president of government affairs at the League of Conservation Voters. Candidates alarmed by Republican inaction were drawn into congressional races across the country. In 2018, we saw a big shift in terms of candidates running on climate change as never before, and that has only increased as were seeing in the presidential, Sittenfeld said. I think  if not every candidate, pretty close to every single candidate  who is going to be on (CNNs town hall) stage has put out an ambitious, comprehensive plan to combat the climate crisis. So weve definitely seen that this issue is finally starting to get the attention that it deserves. The growing alarm is most pronounced among younger voters. John Della Volpe, who directs the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics poll, noted that climate change is now viewed as a top area of concern within both a domestic and foreign policy framework for those within the 18-29 year-old age group, though it generally still ranks behind health care, the economy and immigration. In the Institutes spring poll, protecting the environment ranked third (33%) among foreign policy priorities, behind protecting human rights and preventing the rise of terrorist groups. Jon Krosnick, a political science and communications professor at Stanford University who directs the Political Psychology Research Group, notes that while no single issue dominates the psyche of American voters, his research shows that climate change is becoming a bigger motivator for a larger group of people. Krosnick said 2018 was the year in which the percent of Americans who think global warming is extremely important hit 20%, according to research conducted by the Political Psychology Research Group at Stanford University. In 1997, that number was only 9%, according to the groups research. One out of five Americans  that very big, Krosnick said. It was a consequential issue when it was 17% and 15% and 11%, but its now a bigger issue. Trumps systematic elimination of environmental regulations  changes he has framed as an effort to improve government efficiency, cut red tape and boost the economy  brought more attention to those issues and angered Democrats. Shortly after taking office, Trump withdrew from the Paris Climate Agreement, a move he said was meant to help American industry and demand fair treatment for Americas taxpayers. He has weakened fuel economy targets set by the Obama administration, and revoked the Waters of the US Rule which changed the definition of what wetlands and rivers would be protected by federal regulations. His administration has also sought to reduce the size of national monuments  including Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante in Utah  and open more public lands to logging, mining and drilling. In March, the Environmental Protection Agencys inspector general found that the EPA had exceeded its goals in slashing environmental regulations during the administrations first two years after Trump ordered federal agencies to control costs by cutting regulations. He has mocked the Green New Deal proposed by Democrats as an exorbitantly costly and unnecessary  a policy disagreement that is likely to loom large during the general election. Every week, theres more progress being made advancing the Republican policy agenda. Thats the key point here, is that theres so much evidence of (Trump) dismantling environmental protections in so many ways  including emissions and support for the fossil fuel industry, said Krosnick. Here we have this, this really productive President who is being very successful at getting his regulation-dismantling through. Those actions are going to be very motivating for the voters who care deeply about climate change, he said. Weve got a President who is basically goosing them into action, Krosnick said. So my guess is that they will be a considerable and important force in the election. Turnout will be high in this group, because they will see the difference (between the Republican and Democratic nominees) unless the Democratic nominee chooses to not talk about the environment, or chooses to talk about the environment rarely and disingenuously. The growing alarm about climate change has showed up in poll after poll. A Quinnipiac University poll in late August found that 56% of registered voters nationwide believe climate change is an emergency, and those numbers were much higher among Democrats (84%) and independents (63%). By contrast, 81% of Republicans said they did not believe climate change is an emergency. In a new high since Quinnipiac began asking the question in 2015, 67% of voters said the US is not doing enough to address climate change. Historically, younger voters have been more concerned about climate change than older age groups  and while concern is growing among older Americans, that gap still remains. A Gallup poll earlier this year, for example, found that 60% of Americans 18 to 34 believe global warming will pose a significant threat in their lifetime, compared with only 35% of older Americans. (Overall, 66% of US adults said they believed global warming is caused by human activities). The alarm among younger voters is particularly pronounced: 79% of adults 18 to 34 said they worry a great deal or a fair amount about global warming, compared with 62% of those 55 and older. There is still a strong partisan divide on the issue, which has lined up with Trumps continual tweeting about the issue and his assertion that the press is dramatizing the issue. Gallup found that 12% of Republicans said they were a great deal concerned about global warming, compared with more than two-thirds of Democrats (69%). There are also regional differences in attitudes toward climate change. Gallup found that 67% of people in both the Northeast and the West, for example, believe that global warming has already begun, compared to 60% in the Midwest and 53% in the South. The growing call for government to do more about climate change has encouraged environmental advocates like Sittenfeld, who noted that it is forcing candidates to make the issue a center plank in their policy agendas as they seek to connect with Democrats and independents. Even though Trump continues to deny climate change, and so does (Majority Leader) Mitch McConnell, and theyre both standing in the way of progress and rolling it back wherever they can, these polls demonstrate that how out of touch they are with voters, including with Republican voters, Sittenfeld said. By continuing to pander to polluters they are putting the rest of the elected officials in their party in jeopardy.",04/09/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/09/04/politics/climate-change-voters-demographics/index.html
Climate change makes storms like Dorian more dangerous,"Hurricanes are the most violent storms on the planet, and strong storms are getting stronger thanks to warmer oceans. Dorian, the second strongest Atlantic hurricane in modern record, is a prime example of storms reaching the highest category on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale. The strongest hurricane ever to make landfall in the Bahamas lingered over the islands for days, leaving catastrophic damage behind. While the storm was not caused by the climate crisis, we do know that climate change is worsening the impact of storms like Hurricane Dorian, with higher storm surges, increased rainfall and rising storm intensity. Here are some of the ways hurricanes are being impacted by the climate crisis and how Dorian is indicative of each. Storm surge, not wind or rain, is the number one killer in hurricanes, and climate change is making it worse. Sea level has already risen as a result of climate change, and that rate is accelerating around the world. Current conservative projections for sea level rise by the end of this century (by 2100) are for an additional 12-24 inches, according to the UNs Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Storm surge is the rise in ocean levels brought about by the wind and low pressure in a hurricane. When the winds blow onshore, it pushes the water higher, forcing it farther inland than normal tidal levels. Given a relatively flat coastal plain, raising water levels by only inches can make a dramatic difference on how far inland the water can travel. Adding two to three feet of water height would be like increasing a storms surge by one category on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale. It essentially makes a Category 1 hurricane, which usually has a storm surge of 4-5 feet, have a storm surge into the 6-10 foot range  what you would typically see from a Category 2 hurricane. Residents of Tacloban in the Philippines, where Super Typhoon Haiyan roared ashore in 2013, described the devastating storm surge as like a tsunami  an apt comparison for the 5-7 meter (16-23 foot) wall of water that crashed into the city during the storm. WHAT THIS MEANS FOR DORIAN: Dorians storm surge washed across the many islands in the Northern Bahamas, leaving devastation that is only starting to come into view now that the storm is slowly moving away. While Dorians extreme winds built the surge to exceptional levels, higher base sea levels from climate change adding another foot or so no doubt made a big difference on the largely pancake-flat terrain of the Bahamas. While storm surge causes about half of the fatalities in landfalling hurricanes, the second deadliest aspect of the storm comes from flooding rainfall, which accounts for more than a quarter of all storm-related deaths. Scientists are very confident that climate change is making storm rainfall worse, by increasing the rate at which it falls as well as the amount of rain a storm can produce. That is because the physics behind this increase is very well understood, through a relationship called the Clausius-Clapeyron Equation. Simply put, warmer air holds more water vapor, according to Jim Kossin, an Atmospheric Research Scientist at NOAAs National Centers for Environmental Information. The equation pegs that increase at around 7% more water vapor available in the atmosphere per degree Celsius of warming (nearly 4% per degree Fahrenheit). That would mean that in a world warmed by two degrees Celsius, you would have, on average, around 14% more water vapor in the atmosphere that is available to be dumped as rain. Computer modeling shows this increase consistently, but according to Kossin, there hasnt been a clearly increasing trend in the observed data. Precipitation data is pretty messy stuff, he said, explaining that observing stations are few and far between and the satellite data doesnt go back long enough to draw firm conclusions. There have been several recent storms that provide anecdotal evidence. Hurricanes Harvey and Florence both set tropical rainfall records in the United States. WHAT THIS MEANS FOR DORIAN: We dont know how much rain fell from Dorian quite yet, but totals are sure to be extreme given the slow movement of the storm. Estimates are up to 30 inches or more across Grand Bahama and Great Abaco Island. Hurricanes are essentially massive heat engines that are fueled by warm ocean water and air. This energy is converted into lashing winds and driving rainfall that brings a myriad of devastating impacts when they hit land. Humans are warming the air and oceans where hurricanes are spawned, of this scientists are quite certain. But how this changes hurricanes is an open question with a growing amount of hypotheses. The connection between human-induced warming of the planet and changes in hurricane frequency, intensity or impacts is more challenging to understand, because the historical data-set that scientists have to work with is much shorter and less robust than something like the temperature record. Whereas the global temperature record goes back more than 150 years, records for hurricanes get very sparse prior to the 1970s, when satellites first began beaming back images covering all the worlds oceans. Kossin says the added heat in the oceans is increasing the speed-limit for storms, allowing them to reach higher intensities. The stronger storms are getting stronger, he warned, and the stronger storms are becoming more frequent. The prevailing consensus is that we likely wont see more storms in the future (maybe even fewer), but that these storms may be stronger, according to Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane researcher at Colorado State University. WHAT THIS MEANS FOR DORIAN: Dorian was a Category 5 hurricane (meaning winds greater than 157 mph), and even though there is no Category 6, if you extrapolated the scale out, Dorians 185 mph sustained winds would make it one. Dorian is the latest in a series of storms in recent years to impact the Atlantic as a Category 4 or 5 after Harvey, Irma, Maria and Michael. The warmer oceans extend beyond just the surface, going hundreds of meters deep, allowing plenty of ocean heat content for hurricanes to use for fuel. If you increase the speed limit, you make more room for the storms to strengthen, so it can intensify more quickly, Kossin said. This has led scientists to believe that storms are more likely to undergo rapid-intensification as a result of climate change warming the oceans. Rapid-intensification, as the name implies, is when a storm quickly strengthens (officially a storm has undergone rapid-intensification if its wind-speed increases by 35 mph in 24 hours). Some recent research has shown this increase observed in global tropical data, but the confidence in the data is low. We used to observe storms less frequently and with satellites that had lower resolution, and consequently, we likely couldnt measure rapid intensification as well as we can now, Klotzbach told CNN. Klotzbach noted that while the data shows an increase in the number of storms that have rapidly intensified, it also shows an increasing number of storms have rapidly weakened  indicating the increases could just be a function of better observations. WHAT THIS MEANS FOR DORIAN: Hurricane Dorian underwent rapid intensification several times during its life-cycle  including when it became a hurricane as it passed by Puerto Rico and over the Virgin Islands, and again as it became one of the strongest hurricanes on record when it made landfall in the Bahamas. Hurricanes and tropical storms are moving slower around the planet, according to a study from Kossin. And the slower a storm moves, the more rain it can drop on a particular area, and the longer severe winds have to weaken infrastructure. The 2018 study in the scientific journal Nature showed a 10% decrease in forward speed globally between 1949 and 2016, though there is some variation among ocean basins. Kossin found a 20% to 30% slowdown over land areas affected by North Atlantic and North Pacific tropical cyclones, respectively. According to the study, which looked at each ocean basin where tropical systems form, a slowdown in the movement of the storms has been observed in every basin except the Northern Indian Ocean. Tropical cyclones have slowed more in the Northern Hemisphere, which is significant because that is where a majority of storms occur each year. The western North Pacific basin, where the strongest systems are referred to as typhoons and super typhoons, sees the most storms annually and has seen the most slowing, at 20%. There is considerable evidence that global summertime circulation patterns in the atmosphere are slowing as a result of global warming. Therefore, it would make sense that if the flow around the hurricanes and typhoons is moving slowly, the storms will also be moving slower, which Kossin believes is what he is observing in the data. But there are probably more variables at play than a warmer climate putting the brakes on tropical cyclones. It is far from clear that global climate change has anything to do with the changes being identified, said Kevin Trenberth, a senior climate scientist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research. Several major natural climate variations occur over long periods, such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which is similar to the El Nino/La Nina oscillation that can significantly alter global weather but operates on much longer time scales (hence decadal, whereas El Nino/La Nina alternate from year to year). Trenberth points out that this study did not account for these natural cycles, which he said could be behind much of the observed trend. WHAT THIS MEANS FOR DORIAN: Dorian was one of the slowest, if not the slowest moving major hurricanes we have ever recorded. According to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Philip Klotzbach, Hurricane Dorian traveled the second shortest distance in 24 hours by a major hurricane (Cat 3+) since modern records began in 1950. Dorians average speed over the Bahamas on Monday may have set a record for the slowest moving hurricane.",04/09/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/09/03/weather/climate-change-effects-on-hurricanes/index.html
Trump? rollback of climate change regulations will be felt far beyond his presidency,"In almost every corner of his administration, President Donald Trump has veered sharply from the policies of his predecessor  and even past Republicans. But his rollback of regulations designed to limit global warming is one of the clearest ways he has worked to erase a cornerstone of President Barack Obamas legacy. From promising to leave the landmark Paris climate accord to relaxing restrictions on power plant emissions, Trump has attempted to remove many of the guardrails installed by the Obama administration to limit the emissions of greenhouse gases. These rollbacks come at a critical time. Earth just endured its hottest month on record, and Greenlands massive ice sheet is melting an alarming rate. Last fall, the worlds top climate scientists warned that we have barely more than a decade to drastically cut global carbon emissions, to avoid facing the worst consequences of the climate crisis  droughts, wildfires and food shortages impacting hundreds of millions of people. Regardless of what happens in the 2020 presidential election, critics say Trump has already cemented an environmental legacy that will be felt by generations to come. He is locking in permanent, irreversible damage to our environment through his irresponsible environmental policies, including his efforts to block progress on climate change, said Dr. Michael E. Mann, distinguished professor of atmospheric science at Penn State University and the director of the Penn State Earth System Science Center. Once we go beyond key tipping points  the melting of the major ice sheets  there is no going back. Heres a look at some of Trumps most consequential climate policy rollbacks: Last year, the New York Times reported that the Trump administration was seeking to relax fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions benchmarks, a shift that would stamp out one of Obamas signature climate initiatives. If the proposed change goes into effect, it could have profound consequences for the planet: Transportation emits more greenhouse gases than any other sector of the US economy, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. But California and several other states have sued to block the change, and there are signs that even some automakers are not on board with Trumps rollbacks. In a boost to electrical utilities and the struggling coal industry, Trumps move to replace Obamas Clean Power Plan (CPP) could have serious consequences for the health of humans and the planet. The CPP placed flexible limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and according to analysis by Obamas EPA, would have reduced CO2 emissions from power generators by 32 percent compared to 2005 levels by 2030. Trumps replacement for the CPP is called the Affordable Clean Energy rule and allows states to set their own emissions standards for coal-fueled power plants. Earlier this year, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler touted the plan, saying it gives power companies the regulatory certainty they need to continue to reduce emissions and provide affordable and reliable energy for all Americans. But the new rule could cost American lives. By EPAs own analysis, Trumps rule could result in 1,400 more premature deaths by 2030 than under the CPP. Many states and cities are also suing to block the new regulations from going into effect. Many scientists warn that keeping fossil fuels in the ground is critical to tackling the climate crisis. But the Trump administration has moved the US in the opposite direction, opening vast stretches of land and water offshore to oil and gas drilling. In 2017, the administration shrank two of Utahs national monuments  Grand-Staircase Escalante National Monument and Bear Ears  by 51% and 85% respectively. The moves took land areas spanning twice the size of Rhode Island out of protected status and was part of the largest reduction of public lands in US history, according to a study published in the journal Science. The changes open the areas removed from the national monuments to oil and gas development, but both decisions face challenges in court. The administration has also pushed to open Alaskas Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas exploration, as well as waters offshore along the East and Pacific coasts, and the Arctic. The pipeline projects potentially lock in long term extraction of natural gas and petroleum, and therefore have a very long legacy that will extend beyond the next administration, Mann said. Trumps 2017 decision to pull the US out of the landmark Paris climate accord that was agreed to by nearly all of the worlds countries was a major blow to the global response to the climate crisis. The decision sent a message to the rest of the world that the US  which can legally leave the agreement as early as 2020  would not be leading the global fight against climate change. And studies have shown the decision has had global implications: a report last year found that Trumps decision has made it easier for other countries to renege on their climate commitments. Just last week, Trumps EPA announced that it would no longer require oil and gas companies to install monitors that detect methane leaks from new wells, tanks and pipelines. At a time when the US has become the worlds biggest natural gas and oil producer, the move is significant because of the potency of methanes heat trapping capabilities. Though the gas doesnt last in the atmosphere as long as CO2, one ton of methane has 84 to 87 times more global warming potential than the same amount of CO2 over a 20-year period. Another key global agreement to limit planet-warming gases went into effect earlier this year, but Trump has yet to send it to the Senate to ratify it. The treaty is called the Kigali Amendment, and it deals with a little-known but highly potent class of greenhouse gases called hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which are used in refrigerators and air conditioners. The gases are sometimes called super greenhouse gases because of their capacity to trap huge amounts of heat in the atmosphere - they have more than 1,000 times greater warming potential than carbon dioxide. The climate change solutions organization Project Drawdown has found that phasing out these chemicals would be the most impactful solution to stop global warming  more than eating less meat, driving electric cars or switching to renewable energy.",04/09/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/09/04/politics/trump-climate-change-policy-rollbacks/index.html
I am a CNN meteorologist. I used to be a climate crisis skeptic,"Ive been a meteorologist at CNN since 1999. And for a long time I didnt think that global warming gasses would overwhelm the earth enough to change its climate. As a skeptic, I didnt deny climate change existed. I was questioning the data behind the science. One big number ultimately changed my mind. Watch this video to learn what it is: That was on April 23, 2013. After that day I started attending climate conferences, and continued to consume more and more of the data coming in about climate change. I like to say that I didnt go from denier to believer; I went from skeptic to scholar. And along the way I learned a lot about the climate crisis that I hope will help YOU better understand it as well. For instance, I quickly learned the problem was way bigger than just carbon dioxide: Over the last millennium, the concentration of these gasses in the atmosphere has gone up and down. In tandem, global temperatures have also become warmer, colder and then warmer again. Thats why so many skeptics say climate change is cyclical, and point to that as evidence against global warming. But what were experiencing now is much more extreme than in the past: As this alarming rate of warming continues, it is evident that humans are responsible. And not always in the ways you might think: All of these issues are contributing to global warming  a term that often gets misused, especially during an epic snowstorm or freezing spell during the winter months. The problem is that people are only looking at the weather out their windows: When you look at the crisis from a global perspective, you start to see evidence of a devastating future: Maybe you see the climate crisis as I do now. Maybe you need some more time to gather your own evidence and look closely at the facts. Whenever youre ready, the next step is to figure out how you can start making a difference:",04/09/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/09/04/weather/climate-change-skeptic/index.html

Heres a look at some of Trumps most consequential climate policy rollbacks: Last year, the New York Times reported that the Trump administration was seeking to relax fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions benchmarks, a shift that would stamp out one of Obamas signature climate initiatives. If the proposed change goes into effect, it could have profound consequences for the planet: Transportation emits more greenhouse gases than any other sector of the US economy, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. But California and several other states have sued to block the change, and there are signs that even some automakers are not on board with Trumps rollbacks. In a boost to electrical utilities and the struggling coal industry, Trumps move to replace Obamas Clean Power Plan (CPP) could have serious consequences for the health of humans and the planet. The CPP placed flexible limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and according to analysis by Obamas EPA, would have reduced CO2 emissions from power generators by 32 percent compared to 2005 levels by 2030. Trumps replacement for the CPP is called the Affordable Clean Energy rule and allows states to set their own emissions standards for coal-fueled power plants. Earlier this year, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler touted the plan, saying it gives power companies the regulatory certainty they need to continue to reduce emissions and provide affordable and reliable energy for all Americans. But the new rule could cost American lives. By EPAs own analysis, Trumps rule could result in 1,400 more premature deaths by 2030 than under the CPP. Many states and cities are also suing to block the new regulations from going into effect. Many scientists warn that keeping fossil fuels in the ground is critical to tackling the climate crisis. But the Trump administration has moved the US in the opposite direction, opening vast stretches of land and water offshore to oil and gas drilling. In 2017, the administration shrank two of Utahs national monuments  Grand-Staircase Escalante National Monument and Bear Ears  by 51% and 85% respectively. The moves took land areas spanning twice the size of Rhode Island out of protected status and was part of the largest reduction of public lands in US history, according to a study published in the journal Science. The changes open the areas removed from the national monuments to oil and gas development, but both decisions face challenges in court. The administration has also pushed to open Alaskas Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas exploration, as well as waters offshore along the East and Pacific coasts, and the Arctic. The pipeline projects potentially lock in long term extraction of natural gas and petroleum, and therefore have a very long legacy that will extend beyond the next administration, Mann said. Trumps 2017 decision to pull the US out of the landmark Paris climate accord that was agreed to by nearly all of the worlds countries was a major blow to the global response to the climate crisis. The decision sent a message to the rest of the world that the US  which can legally leave the agreement as early as 2020  would not be leading the global fight against climate change. And studies have shown the decision has had global implications: a report last year found that Trumps decision has made it easier for other countries to renege on their climate commitments. Just last week, Trumps EPA announced that it would no longer require oil and gas companies to install monitors that detect methane leaks from new wells, tanks and pipelines. At a time when the US has become the worlds biggest natural gas and oil producer, the move is significant because of the potency of methanes heat trapping capabilities. Though the gas doesnt last in the atmosphere as long as CO2, one ton of methane has 84 to 87 times more global warming potential than the same amount of CO2 over a 20-year period. Another key global agreement to limit planet-warming gases went into effect earlier this year, but Trump has yet to send it to the Senate to ratify it. The treaty is called the Kigali Amendment, and it deals with a little-known but highly potent class of greenhouse gases called hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which are used in refrigerators and air conditioners. The gases are sometimes called super greenhouse gases because of their capacity to trap huge amounts of heat in the atmosphere - they have more than 1,000 times greater warming potential than carbon dioxide. The climate change solutions organization Project Drawdown has found that phasing out these chemicals would be the most impactful solution to stop global warming  more than eating less meat, driving electric cars or switching to renewable energy.",04/09/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/09/04/politics/trump-climate-change-policy-rollbacks/index.html
Nestl?plans to reduce greenhouse gases across its supply chain,"Nestle has pledged to reach zero net greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, a goal that requires many changes from the worlds biggest food producer and the farmers it works with. By helping protect its supply chain from extreme weather, Nestle aims to protect its bottom line. It also signals to consumers who are increasingly concerned about the environment  and may see Nestle as part of the problem  that the company is trying to help. Global warming poses a huge threat to a business like Nestle, which relies heavily on agricultural products and water. Scientific evidence shows that the food and agricultural sectors will be among those most affected by climate change, said Magdi Batato, the companys head of operations, during a call with reporters. This is why it matters to Nestle. Climate change is one of the greatest risks to the future of our business, Mark Schneider, the companys CEO, said in a statement Thursday. The company has already made several steps toward reducing emissions, but with the new target Nestle is speeding up its work, Schneider said. That means switching over to more sustainable ingredients in Nestle (NSRGY) products, selling more plant-based foods and using greener packaging. It also means helping capture carbon by replanting trees, working with suppliers to use more sustainable farming practices, and using renewable energy in more Nestle (NSRGY) factories, warehouses and offices. The company will set more specific targets over the next two years. The task is huge, Batato said in a statement. But we are determined to make it happen. The changes are designed to play a role in keeping the planet from warming more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, Nestle explained. The companys earlier efforts were aligned with a two-degree goal, a commonly used threshold. Nestle has already made a number of investments that could help it achieve the 2050 commitment. Nestle is participating in Loop, a service that lets consumers buy products in reusable packages. It plans to expand its plant-based offerings through Sweet Earth, a vegetarian meal company it acquired a few years ago. And it has made a number of recycling commitments. These efforts could help temper environmental criticism against the company. Activists have called Nestle a contributor to plastic pollution. And the dairy industry, which Nestle relies on for its chocolate, ice cream and creamers, is a producer of greenhouse gases (Nestles commitments include helping make its dairy suppliers more sustainable). Other big food companies are also trying to make their supply chains more sustainable. Mondelez International, which makes Toblerone, Cadbury and Milka, is planning to switch to sustainable cocoa for its chocolate brands by 2025.",12/09/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/09/12/business/nestle-climate-change/index.html
Investors turn up the heat on companies over climate change,"Investors managing assets worth $35 trillion are sending a message to governments and companies: Do more to fight climate change. A group of 515 investors on Wednesday urged policymakers to act with the utmost urgency to comply with the goals of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, which seeks to limit global warming. Much more needs to be done by governments to accelerate the low carbon transition and to improve the resilience of our economy, society and the financial system to climate risks, the investors said in a statement ahead of next weeks United Nations Climate Action Summit. Signatories to the statement include some of the worlds biggest pensions funds and asset managers, including the California Public Employees Retirement System, UBS Asset Management, Allianz Global Investors and Nomura Asset Management. The group urged governments to phase out thermal coal power and fossil fuel subsidies, and set a price for carbon emissions. They called on companies to provide more information on climate risks. The investors control nearly half of the worlds invested capital, giving them significant influence over the companies and governments best positioned to combat climate change, organizers said. With the immense power and influence that investors hold in our global economy, they have a tremendous opportunity and responsibility to act at the urgent pace and scale required, said Mindy Lubber, CEO of Ceres, a sustainability nonprofit founded in the aftermath of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska, that helped to organize the campaign. United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres has asked governments to present more ambitious climate change plans at a summit on Monday. The goal is to cut greenhouse emissions by 45% by 2030, and to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. I am also asking all investors to scale up green ventures, to increase lending for low-carbon solutions and to stop, in effect, financing pollution, he said in June. A second group of investors managing $15 trillion in assets warned Wednesday that energy companies are not doing nearly enough to reduce carbon usage. Only 31 of the top 109 energy companies are aligned with the pledges made by national governments in Paris, the Transition Pathway Initiative said. The climate agreement signed there in 2015 seeks to limit the global average temperature increase to well below 2 degrees Celsius. Just two oil and gas companies  Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and Repsol (REPYY)  are aligned with the Paris goals, the group said. This new research shows the energy sector is inching rather than accelerating towards a low-carbon future. It is not quick enough, said Adam Matthews, the co-chair of the Transition Pathway Initiative and director of ethics and engagement at the Church of England Pensions Board.

Amazon workers walk out to protest climate change inaction,"Amazon employees walked out in protest on Friday over the companys inaction on climate change. The protest, which was organized by an internal group called Amazon (AMZN) Employees for Climate Justice, was captured in video clips posted to social media. The group claimed more than 1,800 Amazon (AMZN) employees in over 25 cities and 14 countries pledged to take part in the action. According to a release, the group estimates that over 3,000 tech workers walked out in Seattle. It coincided with a greater global movement to fight climate change, The Global Climate Strike, the week-long global event that will bring together young people, labor and humanitarian organizations, environmental groups and company employee collectives. Thousands of strikes are expected to take place in over 130 countries, according to teenaged climate activist Greta Thunberg, who is one of the organizers of the global initiative. Amazon staffers walked out at approximately 11:30 a.m. PT, according to organizers, and gathered in downtown Seattle outside Amazons headquarters. The group amassed in the shadow of The Spheres, the trio of steel-and-glass greenhouses Amazon built for employee use. Staffers held signs with slogans such as Break free from fossil fuels and Great start, Jeff  a reference to an announcement CEO Jeff Bezos made on Thursday that Amazon plans to be carbon neutral by 2040. It followed a February announcement for Shipment Zero, an Amazon effort with a self-described ambitious goal of being carbon neutral on 50% of all Amazon shipments by 2030. It also has claimed online shopping and cloud computing emit less carbon than trips to the store and physical on-site data centers. The group of Amazon employees behind the walkout acknowledged in a press release that Bezos recent pledge was a huge win for the group but not enough. It tweeted that it wants Amazon to commit to zero emissions by 2030 and pilot electric vehicles first in communities most impacted by pollution. Amazon has repeatedly said climate change is an important commitment. During the walkout in Seattle, speakers from different tech companies took turns at a podium revving up the crowd. Climate change is and must be a work-appropriate conversation, a Google (GOOG) employee and action organizer said. Climate action is your job. This means living our values, walking into the office every day ready to reassert what you believe in. The employee, identified as Sam, said workers need to support one another. We are a community united across tech, across countries, she said. We are not Google. We are not Amazon or Microsoft, Facebook, Apple, Twitter. We are human beings and we need each other right now. The group encouraged Amazon to lead in the effort to reach zero emissions  not resign itself to sliding in at the last moment. It noted Amazons size as one of the reasons the company needs to take action. Amazon employs around 600,000 people globally. The groups stated objective includes the desire for Amazon to stop donating to politicians and lobbyists who deny climate change and to stop awarding contracts to fossil fuel companies. Its not the first time Amazon employees have taken a stand over environmental issues. In May, over 7,600 employees signed a letter asking Amazon how it planned to respond to climate change.",20/09/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/09/20/tech/amazon-climate-strike-global-tech/index.html
How newsrooms across the country are covering the climate crisis,"Listeners of WNYCs daily program The Brian Lehrer Show say theyre limiting their use of plastics. Theyre using bamboo toothbrushes. Theyre making their own coffee with a French press. Theyre purchasing reusable cups. Its all part of Lehrers #PlasticChallenge, which he launched last week in tandem with the global journalism initiative, Covering Climate Now. A rap on climate talk is that its boring, that it can be technical, doom and gloom without a lot of solutions and remote from peoples lives unless you were caught in the middle of something, that its abstract and a remote threat for the year 2100. Judging from the demand to get on the air by callers and participating in the #PlasticChallenge people were really engaged, Lehrer told CNN Business. WNYC is one of more than 300 media outlets that have agreed to use the lead-up to the UN Climate Action Summit on Monday to elevate stories about the climate crisis. Covering Climate Now is spearheaded by progressive publication The Nation and by Columbia Journalism Review, which billed it as the biggest effort ever undertaken to organize the worlds press around a single topic. Soon after Climate Change Now launched in April, The Guardian also joined the effort as a lead media partner, and newsrooms have been signing on ever since. The partner list includes wire services, photo agencies, newspapers, magazines, digital outlets and individual journalists. Scientists and media watchdogs have long criticized news outlets for failing cover the climate crisis prominently. Reporters and their news organizations sidelined climate stories as too technical or too political or too depressing, wrote Kyle Pope, CJRs top editor, and Mark Hertsgaard, The Nations environment correspondent. Spun by the fossil-fuel industry and vexed by their own business problems, media outlets often leaned on a false balance between the views of genuine scientists and those of paid corporate mouthpieces. But that is changing with Covering Climate Now. Editors and reporters across local, national and global newsrooms in radio, online and TV told CNN Business they have been investing in more climate crisis coverage. The commitment to promote climate stories with the #CoveringClimateNow hashtag started on September 15, but many news organizations hope to stick with it long past Mondays UN event. One reason is the readership and engagement from audiences have increased. Vox Medias Alissa Walker, the urbanism editor for its real estate vertical Curbed, told CNN Business she saw an uptick in traffic late last week when the outlet shared stories with the #CoveringClimateNow hashtag on social media. As recently as two years ago, putting climate change in a headline guaranteed that no one would read it. But thats definitely changed, Walker said. As part of the initiative, reporters for Curbed wrote features about how the building industry contributes to the climate crisis and how the Green New Deal would affect design and architecture industries. They updated Curbeds list of 101 ways to fight the climate change and covered the climate strikes in cities like Chicago, D.C. and New York. Local outlets investigated stories that specifically affected their communities. The San Francisco Chronicles coverage included a feature on California farmers adapting to warmer weather. The Daily Hampshire Gazette of Northampton, Massachusetts, published a story about the countys air quality rating. The Toronto Stars participation included a two-part series on differing climate crisis policies in Canadas federal election campaign. Kenyon Wallace, an investigative reporter at the Toronto Star, said the paper jumped at the chance to be part of Covering Climate Now so their climate coverage could reach even more readers. Earlier this year, the outlet ran a 16-part series titled Undeniable, which included stories about permafrost, wildfires, droughts, record temperatures and rising sea levels, he said. There are, no doubt, more stories that will be on our radar given that we live in a country that in some areas is experiencing warming as much as three times the global average, Wallace said. On Monday, participating outlets not only covered the UN Climate Action Summit in real-time but also continued to publish new original pieces. DCist published a story about D.C. educators who are bringing the climate crisis topic to the classroom. Vanity Fair on Monday published an interview with former New York Times science reporter Tatiana Schlossberg about her new book on the climate crisis. Meanwhile, NowThis live-streamed Mondays summit and shared videos of activists like Bill Nye, Greta Thunberg, Hannah Mills. Bloomberg started prepping their stories for Covering Climate Now about six weeks in advance and released what would typically be a months worth of features and analysis in one week, said senior executive editor John Fraher. The outlet has already been covering climate through the lens of business for years. We talk about climate change as this thing thats going to happen in the future, if we dont cut emissions, but its happening now and thats changed how businesses are thinking and acting. Its becoming more and more important to our readers. You can see that in the readership numbers, Fraher said. The New Republic also increased its cadence of climate stories from about two to three stories per week to at least one per day, according to executive editor Ryan Kearney. He said their most-read story was a deep dive into what life would be like if one of the five models by climate scientists was accurate. The writer, Emily Atkin, recently left a staff position of The New Republic to start a climate-focused newsletter called Heated. This week is a good example of what its going to be like going forward. This will probably be the minimum expectation that well have a climate piece a day, Kearney said. For WNYC, the initiative not only inspired the outlet to cover more climate stories in the future, but it changed workplace behaviors. On September 19, the office held a celebration where the invite requested people bring their own reusables. Going forward, thatll be the case for all meetings and events.",23/09/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/09/23/media/climate-change-newsrooms/index.html
Look to the ocean for climate change solutions,"Humanity is exacting a terrible toll on the ocean. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) will publish its Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate later this week. Its overarching message will be that global warming, combined with the negative impacts of numerous other human activities, is devastating our ocean, with alarming declines in fish stocks, the death of our reefs, and sea level rise that could displace hundreds of millions of people. But there is a glimmer of hope  there is now overwhelming scientific evidence that the ocean can be a potent force in stabilizing the climate and building a secure future for everyone. Ocean-based climate solutions could deliver as much as 21% of the emissions reductions needed to limit global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2050. These reductions could amount to 11.8 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent, or CO2e  a standard unit that measures the impact of greenhouse gases in relation to the effects of CO2. This figure is greater than the current emissions from all coal-fired power plants worldwide. These are the key figures from a new report released today, commissioned by the High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy composed of 14 prime ministers and presidents, which we are proud to chair. It demonstrates in detail, for the first time, how a sustainable ocean economy could play a much bigger role than we previously thought in shrinking our carbon footprint, achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement, and delivering on the Sustainable Development Goals set forth by the UN in 2015. Given the reports findings, the High Level Panel is launching a Call to Ocean-Climate Action at the U.N. Climate Action Summit in New York today. The call presents a list of five actions we can take to boost ocean health and mitigate the climate crisis. The first thing we should do is scale up ocean-based renewable energy (such as offshore wind turbines and new technologies to harness the energy of waves and tides). As an alternative to fossil fuels, this has the potential to cut the most emissions  as much as 5.4 gigatons of CO2e annually by 2050. Thats the equivalent of taking over a billion cars off the road for a year. We also need to ramp up our ambitions to decarbonize shipping and marine transport; fortunately, many of the solutions to do this already exist. It is also crucial to protect and restore mangroves, seagrasses, salt marshes, and other coastal and marine ecosystems that face a huge threat from over-development. Doing so would prevent significant quantities of greenhouse gases from entering the atmosphere by increasing natures capacity to sequester carbon. Additionally, developing low-carbon sources of protein from the ocean  like seafood, seaweeds and kelp  can provide a healthy and sustainable diet for future populations while easing emissions from land-based food production. We have the available tools to start implementing these ocean-based climate actions now. To win the fight against climate change, we need all hands on deck  on land and sea. We are strongly urging other leaders around the world to swiftly implement these actions to secure a healthy, low-carbon and climate-resilient future for our ocean. Until now, our ocean has played a relatively minor role in national climate plans and strategies. The actions outlined in our new report offer exciting new opportunities to fight the climate crisis. All governments should incorporate ocean-based solutions in their national climate commitments in 2020, and in their actions to meet the Sustainable Development Goals. Lets pull together and seize this opportunity to save our climate by transforming the way we interact with our ocean. As the leaders of Norway and Palau  two countries where the vitality of the ocean is critical  we understand how the climate crisis affects our citizens, along with the rest of the world. There is nowhere to hide; the impacts of the climate emergency will be felt from the deepest ocean ravines to the highest mountaintops; from the small islands in the middle of the Pacific, to the largest nations on every continent. The ocean is becoming increasingly hotter and more acidic, which threatens all life on our planet. But this story need not end in tragedy. The ocean can be a vibrant source of inspiration and hope, as well as a powerful partner in the fight to turn the tide against the climate crisis. It is well within our capacity to build a sustainable ocean economy that benefits both nature and humanity  but we must act now before it is too late.",23/09/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/09/23/opinions/un-ocean-climate-change-solutions-solberg-remengesau/index.html
Landmark UN report warns sea levels will rise faster than projected by 2100,"Cities from New York to Shanghai could see regular flooding, as sea levels rise faster than previously thought. Glaciers and ice sheets from the Himalayas to Antarctica are rapidly melting. And the fisheries that feed millions of people are shrinking. These are just some of the impacts that emissions of greenhouse gases have already triggered across the planets oceans and frozen regions, according to a new landmark report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). More than 100 scientists from 36 countries worked on the report  titled the Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate. It is the last of three special reports from the IPCC following last Octobers urgent report that showed the world may only have until 2030 to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees, and Augusts report on climate impacts to the planets lands. This report is unique because for the first time ever, the IPCC has produced an in-depth report examining the furthest corners of the Earth  from the highest mountains in remote polar regions to the deepest oceans, said Ko Barrett, vice chair of the IPCC. Weve found that even and especially in these places, human-caused climate change is evident. It is just the latest scientific evidence showing that human-induced warming is rapidly taking the planet down an uncharted path. The scientists say there may be some impacts to the global climate  like some amount of sea level rise  that can no longer be stopped. But even though there is uncertainty in the report about what exactly the future holds, the authors are unambiguous on this: Despite the damage that has been done, humanity still has a choice. Taking swift action to end the global economys dependence on fossil fuels can ward off some of the worst projected impacts, they say. Or, we continue down the path we are on, into a world far less hospitable than the one we live in. This new report paints a full and alarming picture of the rapid thawing happening in frozen regions all across the globe  and how the changes will dramatically alter human civilization in the coming decades. The findings show that the planets warming is accelerating melting in glaciers and ice sheets from Greenland to Antarctica, and that sea levels will likely rise more than previously projected by the end of this century. Of the major ice sheets, Greenlands  which has the potential to raise sea levels around 20 feet  is melting the fastest, and lost more than 275 gigatons on average per year between 2006 and 2015. But the even larger Antarctic ice sheet is also shrinking, and its mass loss tripled between 2007 and 2016 compared to the previous ten years. Because of the growing contributions from Antarctic melting, the authors say sea level rise is now likely to exceed three feet by 2100 if carbon emissions continue to increase. Perhaps most concerning is what may be happening to the Antarctic ice sheet, which has the potential to raise sea levels much higher. The scientists warn that more study is needed, but say changes observed in parts of Antarctica could be the first signs the ice sheet has reached a point of no return. If this is true, then there is a chance of a multi-meter sea level rise within the next two to three centuries, said Regine Hock, a professor at the University of Alaska Fairbanks and a coordinating lead author on chapter two of this IPCC report. That is very substantial. Even if collapse of the Antarctic ice sheet is not imminent, the report says that many of the 680 million people around the world living in low-lying coastal areas will experience annual flooding events by 2050 that used to occur only once a century. At the other pole, scientists have long known that the Arctic is warming at a much faster pace than the rest of the planet. But over the last 40 years, the report finds that Arctic sea ice is very likely shrinking during all months of the year, which is driving further warming. The decrease observed in September sea ice is particularly significant and likely unprecedented for at least 1000 years. In nearly all regions, the scientists also found that snow cover is diminishing and glaciers are in retreat. Runoff from these sources provides drinking water to millions and is used to grow much of the food we eat. And permafrost, soil that stays frozen throughout the year and contains gigatons of potentially planet-warming carbon and methane, has also undergone record warming. Scientists say the oceans that cover 71 percent of Earths surface have borne the brunt of the warming that humans have caused. But the report warns they can no longer keep up. It is virtually certain that the worlds oceans have warmed nonstop since 1970 and have absorbed 90 percent of the planets excess heat, the report says. Marine heatwaves that have killed off vast stretches of Earths coral reefs have very likely doubled in frequency and are projected to become more common and intense, the report finds. The oceans also naturally absorb carbon dioxide from the air and have likely stored 20 to 30 percent of what humans have released into the atmosphere since 1980, the report says. But absorbing massive amounts of carbon has made the ocean more acidic and inhospitable to corals that millions of other species depend on for survival. As a result, shifts have occurred in the geographic ranges of many species and maximum fish catches have decreased, the scientists say. Some regions, like the Arctic, could see fish populations increase. But across the worlds tropics, fish and other seafood are likely to become harder to find. For the millions of people around the world that depend on the ocean as a primary food source, the findings are troubling. Taken together, these changes show that the worlds ocean and cryosphere have been taking the heat for climate change for decades, said Barrett. The consequences for nature and humanity are sweeping and severe. The report is clear that there are some future impacts to the oceans and ice that cannot be avoided. Instead, many vulnerable cities and communities  especially along the coasts and in the Arctic  will be forced to adapt to the changes. Doing so will be difficult, especially for those in the poorest countries. And the scale and pace of the changes coming, the report warns, will challenge governments abilities to develop and implement solutions. But the science is equally clear that many of the projected impacts can be avoided through ambitious and rapid reductions in carbon emissions. For instance, rates of sea level rise are projected to reach 15 millimeters per year by 2100 under a high emissions scenario. But under a lower emissions scenario  where humans draw down global greenhouse gases very soon  sea levels are expected to rise much slower at 4 millimeters per year. It drives home the message that policies that curb greenhouse gas emissions can have a strong effect on future sea level rise, said Andrea Dutton, an associate professor in the Department of Geoscience at the University of Wisconsin Madison. What we do today can decide which of those pathways were on. The choices made now are critical to limit the future impacts, and avoid the escalating costs and risks that come with delayed action, the report says.",25/09/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/09/25/world/un-ipcc-report-oceans-and-ice-climate-change/index.html
Climate change is raising quite the stink in Florida,"A major UN report released this week shows the sea level is rising around the globe, which means people who live in coastal cities face real risks from losing their property, and in some cases their live, to the rising ocean and the intense storms these warmer waters bring. And it will make it harder for more than 60 million people in the United States to flush their toilets. About 1 in 5 US households rely on septic systems, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. Its a type of sanitary system that has worked since ancient Egyptian times, but the climate crisis and septic systems dont mix, studies show. These systems will be incredibly vulnerable to sea level rise and heavy rains. The climate crisis has brought both. In areas with drought, it may also be difficult to get the volume of water needed to keep the tanks functioning, studies show. Many systems are clustered in coastal areas that are already expecting sea level rise, including around Boston and New York. Nearly half of New England homes depend on them. Florida also has a disproportionate share. Its home to 2.6 million systems, or about 12% of all the septic systems in the country, the Florida Department of Health estimates. Miami-Dade County alone is home to more than 105,000 septic systems. Sea level rise is not a registered voter. It doesnt have a party. Its something that is going to affect everyone, said Rebeca Sosa, vice chairwoman of the Miami-Dade County Commission, who spearheaded a study on septic tank vulnerability in the county. She knows its not a glamorous political issue, but with a lot of her residents living on Social Security checks, theyre not going to have the extra funds to deal with the issue. Our job right now is to make sure that we make the state and the federal government understand ... that we need help, so we can help those who are not going to be able to pay to have sewer lines. A county report predicts that within the next 25 years, 64% of the tanks could break and need repairs every year. The report found there are likely 1,000 properties already failing under current conditions. Thats bad news for residents, but news that will keep some workers busy. When Jason and Brittnie Nesenman were high school sweethearts, never in a million years did they picture themselves standing where they are today: Together, hovering over someone elses poop. Jason gets a better angle on a bright blue corrugated hose as Brittnie oversees the operation. The hose runs from their tanker truck, painted with their companys colorful slogan, We love your stinkin business, into a septic system. Workers concentrate as they move boards and branches. Together, they clean the tank dug into the side yard of a million-dollar home. Brittnie shakes her head and laughs, as she describes the fortuitousness of Jasons decision to start Jasons Septic Inc. 15 years ago. It certainly didnt feel that way at the time. I was pregnant when Jason came home and told me he quit his job working for a local plumber. I actually gasped, Brittnie said. I was a massage therapist. We had no money. It may not have been the most romantic gesture when Jason swapped his beloved classic car for a septic draining tanker truck, but it gives the couple a sunny future at a time when the climate crisis darkens Miami-Dade Countys doorstep. The systems need a certain level of unsaturated dirt to work, but the dirt is disappearing as the sea level is rising. With the sea level going up, the water table has risen up, said Jason. With a sewer system, he explains, water is whisked away to a water treatment plant. With septic, the dirt around the tank filters out the contaminants. You flush your toilet, the waste fills a tank on property. Bacteria breaks it down. The heavier material falls to the bottom of the tank. Eventually, the effluent goes into underground pipes and gets released into the soil. The higher water table is eating away at all that dirt. Everything floats downhill, if theres no more downhill and youre in the water, its just not going to work, Jason explains. So the systems, the older systems arent lasting as long. No soil means no filter, and no filter means contamination, Jennifer Cooper concluded in her 2016 study titled Hell and High Water: Diminished Septic System Performance in Coastal Regions Due to Climate Change. The combination of sea level rise and the wetter conditions and warmer temperature is going to be a problem for these systems, for sure, Cooper said. Rachel Silverstein, the executive director for Miami Waterkeeper, a nonprofit that fights to protect South Florida waters, eyes the areas septic systems with real concern. Contamination is a real possibility, said Silverstein. Broken septic systems mean when it floods people will be wading through waste that can make them sick. If untreated sewage gets into area waters, it can create algae blooms and other ecological problems. As he drives a golf cart from his tiny house real estate office to his lofted modern home, Marcelo Fernandes points to parts of his neighborhood road that flood. Fernandes, a developer who sells homes in the area, says he has seen more floods due to high tides, even on days with clear skies. His neighborhood is on septic. Hes worried about the sewage that will be in those flood waters when these septic systems break. Studies show this is a real threat to human health and to drinking water. When we are talking about flooding, we are talking about walking around in sewage, its bacterial infested sewage, Fernandes says with disbelief. This is not a third-world country, this is Miami. This shouldnt happen. Doug Yoder, the deputy director of the Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Department, says the county has been strategizing and working on the problem of sea level rise for about 30 years. This water management system is probably one of the most complex anywhere in the world, explained Yoder. We are in a place where the ocean is directly connected to our shallow groundwater system. As sea level rises, which it is clearly doing, it is going to affect our ability to both protect our drinking water supply and protect the built environment. The county report estimates it would take more than $3.3 billion to build the infrastructure to connect residential and businesses to the system and to support the additional service that will be needed from pumping systems and move properties to traditional sewer. Its going to require even more than that, because you would also have to tear up the streets, and increase the capacity in our treatment system, said Yoder. For residents, replacing a septic system with sewer could cost between $15,000 to $50,000 out of pocket. Its not an easy bill to pay for many residents and not an easy sell for politicians. Miami Waterkeepers Silverstein worries the area isnt ready to adapt. All of the rules and regulations arent there quite yet, Silverstein said. Theres still a lot of development and people are really just hoping for the best. There are counties in the area that are already working to eliminate all their septic systems in the next decade. Martin County, for example, has about 10,000 systems left to replace. The county is sharing the cost with residents. New developments there have to be connected to sewer lines. Thats not the case in Miami-Dade County, where there are still new developments being built on septic. Miami-Dade County Commissioner Sosa is introducing legislation to change that. Sosa has serious concerns about how much this septic system problem will cost her constituents. She has worked with the governor to get funding. She also hopes to get more information to the public about the issue. How do we fix this? Its not easy, said Sosa. Even if people have the money, if they live miles from closest sewer connection it may not even be possible to connect, Sosa said, so the area will have to come up with alternatives, like elevating some systems. We have to act and we have to act with speed, Sosa said. But if we dont get funding assistance its going to be impossible to do. Politically, Sosa said it may be hard to find the money for this, but, she said the countys future depends on it. We dont need people saying We dont go to Miami-Dade County, because look at the problems they have with the sewer system. Look at the contamination we have with the drinking water,  Sosa said. Its of an incredible importance. The drinking water and the safety and health of the people, that has no price.",27/09/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/09/27/health/septic-climate-change-miami-eprise/index.html
Greta Thunberg got the world? attention. But are leaders really listening?,"When Greta Thunberg began her speech to the United Nations, it was clear from the start that her address to world leaders would be different. My message is that well be watching you. The line was met by applause and some laughs, but her expression signaled that this was no laughing matter to her. If you listen to the scientists, as Thunberg urged Congress to do earlier this month, its easy to understand why. If the planet continues to warm, the evidence suggests the future awaiting her generation could be frightening. The 16-year-olds fiery speech was a milestone of sorts for a movement thats been given new urgency by a group of savvy young leaders. Around the world, young people are increasingly leading the push to address climate change. They are filing lawsuits, marching in the streets in massive numbers, and pressuring world leaders to act. But based on the wan commitments to reduce planet-warming emissions that were announced at the UN Climate Summit this week  and the absence of major polluters like the US from the stage entirely  key world leaders still arent willing to take the transformative action scientists say we need to rid the global economy of its fossil fuel dependence. The science is clear that we need to act now. And to do so, the adults in power will have to listen to the kids. The global climate strikes that brought millions out last Friday werent just notable for their size. The crowds are more diverse, more female and younger than theyve ever been before, said Dana R. Fisher, a University of Maryland sociology professor who has studied and surveyed the climate movement for years. At the march in Washington, Fisher and her research team surveyed nearly 200 of those in attendance. They found that 58 percent of the strike participants identified as female, compared to 50.8 percent of the US population that identified as female in the 2010 census. Fisher surveyed more than 100 organizers of marches around the country and found even more females in charge, with 68 percent of respondents identifying as female. Those participating in the DC march were young, with 25 percent under the age of 18, according to Fishers polling. Since Ive been studying the people who participate in these protests, I can tell you that the people who are in the streets are much, much younger than they were before, Fisher said. Greta Thunberg isnt alone. Meet some other young activists who are leading the environmentalist fight Alexandria Villasenor, a 14-year-old activist who has been striking outside the United Nations every Friday for nearly a year, says that her peers need adult allies, but that they have infused the movement with youthful ambition at a critical time. When the youth are leading, we think outside of the box and outside of the system thats been created, said Villasenor. We think about what really needs to happen to combat the climate crisis, we dont think about whats politically possible. Rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society. That was the message from a dire report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that detailed what needs to be done to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. But that report was delivered nearly a year ago. Since then, more alarming evidence of the damage humans are doing to the planet has emerged. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere continues to climb, and Earth just endured its hottest month on record this July. Despite the urgency conveyed by scientists and expressed by the growing youth movement, some world leaders dont appear to be heeding their calls. This week, aiming to spur governments and businesses, the United Nations began its General Assembly with a day-long Climate Action Summit. From the beginning, I said the ticket to entry is not a beautiful speech, but concrete action, said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres as he opened the summit. But the countries that could put the biggest dent in global emissions were largely absent. President Trump made a brief 15-minute appearance in the audience, but the US  which has produced more greenhouse gas emissions than any other country  was essentially a no-show at the summit. China, which currently emits more greenhouse gases than any other country, announced it had achieved its emissions reductions goals ahead of schedule, but made no new commitments. While there were some significant commitments made by smaller countries, businesses and financial institutions, experts say what was announced is not nearly enough. The countries that have agreed to enhance their climate goals by 2020 represent just 8 percent of global emissions, said Helen Mountford, vice president of climate and economics at the World Resources Institute. It just reflects an incredible disconnect between the politicians who are lagging behind what were seeing from the youth on the streets, and with what businesses and investors are doing, Mountford said. One week after millions of people poured onto streets around the globe, a small crowd gathered outside of New Yorks city hall Friday, after Greta Thunberg and other youth leaders again called for more strikes. In a crowd that skewed very young, many said they had seen the devastating storms and felt the higher temperatures. They said it was deep concern that compelled them to skip school and speak out. We see the studies and we know how scary the situation actually is, and were acting out of fear, said Gabby Campos, a 17-year-old high school student. Others like Marco Volpitta, a 17-yard-old who said he has been striking every Friday for a month, said he was frightened by future climate projections, but also felt it was his duty to get involved. We have not just a moral duty to strike, but we have a survivalist imperative to do it, he said. Volpitta and Campos will both be old enough to vote by next November, and they plan to make themselves heard through more traditional means at the polls in the 2020 presidential election. In the meantime, their message to leaders echoes Thunbergs: From the halls of Congress to the floor of the UN General Assembly, they say they will be watching.",28/09/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/09/28/world/climate-change-youth-activists-greta-thunberg-world-leaders-inaction/index.html
Shipping is one of the dirtiest industries. Now it? trying to clean up its act,"In the port of Antwerp in Belgium, a small boat whizzes around, shuttling 16 passengers back and forth. The Hydroville is fast, silent and, most strikingly, it produces zero pollution. Built by Compagnie Maritime Belge (CMB), its the worlds first sea-faring vessel to burn hydrogen in a diesel engine. No carbon dioxide or sulfur oxides are released during the process. The ship produces some nitrogen oxide, but thats converted into harmless nitrogen and water by a catalyst. In one of the dirtiest industries in the world, its a tantalizing glimpse of a cleaner future. Owned by one of Belgiums oldest shipping families, CMB and its small boat are leading the way as the shipping industry tries to tackle its contribution to the climate crisis. Green hydrogen-based fuels are the only zero-emission solution in the long run, CMB CEO Alexander Saverys told CNN Business. The United Nations warned in 2018 that the world had 12 years to stem catastrophic levels of global warming, piling the pressure on international shipping to clean up its act. Ships are incredibly polluting, belching out millions of tons of greenhouse gases every year. They emit sulfur dioxide, a pollutant linked to respiratory illnesses, as well as carbon dioxide and methane, gases which cause global warming by trapping heat in the atmosphere. Maritime emissions account for around 3% of global carbon dioxide output, roughly the same as aviation. According to the World Economic Forum, if shipping was a country, it would be the sixth-largest polluter in the world. And if unchecked, the problem is only going to get much worse. Ships transport over 90% of goods that are traded and the industry has been growing rapidly. By the middle of this century, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) projects that emissions will grow by between 50% and 250% if vessels continue to burn fossil fuels. That would leave shipping producing as much as 17% of global carbon dioxide emissions in 2050. While the industry was excluded from the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement because its emissions are hard to allocate to individual countries, the international community has started to act. Under pressure from island states threatened by rising sea levels, the IMO  a UN body that regulates shipping  set a target last year of slashing emissions by at least 50% by 2050, compared to 2008. But achieving this ambitious goal requires ship owners to move away from fossil fuels and invest in cleaner technology, much of which has never been used on large vessels before. The challenge is particularly acute because the choices shipping companies make now will play out over the next 30 years. Were building the ships today which will be in operation over the next three decades, Dr. Tristan Smith, an expert in shipping and energy at University College Londons (UCL) Energy Institute, said in an interview with CNN Business. To stand any chance of meeting the IMO target, zero emissions vessels need to enter the fleet by 2030 at the latest, he added. Since the IMO set its target, many of the worlds largest shipping companies have made ambitious pledges to slash their emissions over the next three decades. For some, the first step was simple  reduce the speed at which their fleets ply the oceans. That has already resulted in emissions being cut by as much as 30%, according to a report by the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), which ranks the sustainability efforts of the worlds largest operators. But sailing more slowly is only a short-term fix that wont do enough to hit the IMO target, according to CDP. Success requires new ships, new engines and new fuels. Major financial, regulatory and technical barriers have to be overcome, and so far much of the shipping industry is dragging its feet when it comes to innovation. Shipping companies are failing to push for the critical technologies required to reduce their carbon footprint, according to CDP. Just three of the 18 companies CDP ranked have a committee at board level responsible for tackling the climate emergency. One of the frontrunners is Maersk, the worlds largest container shipping company with $39 billion in revenue last year. It has pledged to become fully carbon neutral by 2050 and has invested $1 billion since 2014 in energy efficient technodoelogy. The companys head of sustainability, John Kornerup, told CNN Business that by 2030 Maersk intends to reduce emissions by 60%. If we want to be ready in 10 years, we need to get started now, he said. Maersk is running trials with different fuels and also developing electric batteries. Decarbonizing shipping requires a completely new propulsion technology, Kornerup added. But even Maersk, with its financial firepower, says it cannot make zero-carbon ships a reality without industry collaboration. The Mette Maersk, powered by an oil and biofuel blend, arrives in Hong Kong  Credit: Maersk Its an approach CMB has already adopted. The company, which has won multiple sustainability awards since it was bought by the Saverys family in 2015, recently announced a partnership with Japans Tsuneishi Facilities and Craft to build the worlds first ferry that can run on hydrogen and diesel by 2021. CMBs strategy is about testing low-carbon technologies on smaller ships, such as the Hydroville, and then scaling them up. The Hydroville is a small project which aims 10 years ahead of its time, Roy Campe, CMBs research and development manager, told CNN Business. The Hydroville is a splendid example of how a commercially-driven project can offer high sustainability gains, Antwerp Port Authority CEO Jacques Vandermeiren said last year. CMB plans to launch a hydrogen engine next year that can power larger vessels such as tugboats and barges. And its hoping to launch the worlds first hydrogen-powered container ships in the next decade. As a family-run business which was taken private in 2015, CMB is less constrained by shareholders than public companies such as Maersk. Coming up with new technologies involves risks and that is why there is almost no innovation, Campe said. Norwegian cruise liner Hurtigruten is pursuing different technology. It has just launched the worlds first hybrid cruise ship. Powered by a combination of batteries and marine gas oil, the Roald Amundsen sailed from Tromso to Hamburg in July, producing 20% fewer emissions than other ships of the same size, according to Daniel Skjeldam, Hurtigrutens CEO. To operate sustainably, you have to invest in new technology. This is a new green revolution thats coming, said Skjeldam, adding that the cruise sector has been lagging other industries when it comes to cutting emissions. The cruise industry grew by almost 50% between 2010-2018 and the number of passengers increases by 4-6% each year, according to Cruise Lines International Association. An undercover investigation by Johns Hopkins University this year found that cruise ships generate dangerous levels of air pollution. And the worlds largest cruise operator, Carnival, emitted almost 10 times more sulfur oxide  a highly toxic gas  than all 260 million cars in Europe in 2017, according to a review by non-profit Transport and Environment in June. A Carnival spokesperson told CNN the report was based on outdated numbers and differs dramatically from fuel data and emissions tracked on Carnival Corporation (CCL)s vessels. Despite the trials of new technology by companies such as Maersk, Hurtigruten and CMB, industry-wide progress is too slow. Big companies are hesitant to invest billions of dollars in new technology and there are few financial incentives and regulations in place to push them to do so. But experts say it is crucial that the industry does not wait to be forced to act. The cruise industry should be front runners in introducing new technology and reducing emissions. We simply cannot wait for regulations, Skjeldam said. The biggest challenge for the shipping industry is moving away from heavy fuel oil, a type of diesel used by most of the worlds tankers and cargo ships. Battery technology is powering the clean vehicle revolution on land. But fully electric ships are unlikely to be sailing the seas by 2050. Electric batteries cannot store enough energy to propel deep sea vessels traveling long distances, experts say. Low carbon fuel may be the answer, UCLs Smith said. Many companies are focusing on liquified natural gas (LNG) and biofuels as alternatives. By 2021, Hurtigruten aims to operate a fully hybrid fleet, retrofitting all its 16 ships with a combination of LNG, batteries and biogas. Almost half our fleet will be literally powered by nature, as we will replace engines with batteries, natural gas and biogas  made from organic waste such as dead fish, Skjeldam said. The batteries on board the Roald Amundsen kick in whenever there is a surge in energy demand, Skjeldam explained. We use the batteries to take care of these peaks. When the engines produce excess energy, this is transferred into the batteries. This secures smooth and optimal running of the engines at all time, significantly reducing fuel consumption and emissions, he said. LNG is substantially less polluting than conventional diesel fuel and utilizing LNG as a component in different hybrid set-ups is a major step towards achieving Hurtigrutens ultimate ambition of sailing emission free, he added. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) already operates one of the largest LNG fleets in the world, managing over 40 carriers powered by the natural gas. But LNG has significant drawbacks and experts say it is not a viable long-term solution. It may be less toxic than diesel, but its primary component is methane  a gas that is roughly 30 times more potent at trapping heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide. Biofuel is a better alternative as far as Maersk is concerned. The company recently used a blend of fuels produced from plant waste to help power a container ship traveling from Rotterdam to Shanghai. By using the fuel mix  20% biofuels and 80% fuel oil  Maersk reduced the vessels CO2 emissions by 85% or 1,500 tons, the equivalent of what 200 households produce each year. Its the only option for now, Kornerup told CNN Business. Still, even that has its problems. Using biofuels for shipping is a wasted opportunity to store CO2 and is only viable in very limited quantities, according to Smith at UCL. Using land to generate solar power is about eight times more efficient than biofuel production, he noted. According to a report from the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), mass adoption of biofuels is not the answer. Scientists say that ramping up their production would lead to a huge spike in global food prices as agricultural land is diverted. The biggest pitfalls are biofuels, which cant be scaled or enforced sustainably, especially in shipping. LNG and synthetic methane are other dead ends due to methane leakage and enforcement problems, Transport and Environment concluded in its 2018 report, Roadmap to Decarbonising European Shipping. Hydrogen is one of the most promising solutions for companies looking to meet the IMO target as it is clean and suitable for all ship sizes. But this fuel also presents challenges. The storage of hydrogen is probably the biggest stumbling block. Compressed hydrogen takes 15 times more space compared to diesel for the same amount of energy, CMB CEO Saverys said. Experts say companies should make the huge leap towards decarbonization by investing in dual combustion systems, which use a combination of diesel and low-carbon fuels, such as hydrogen, or batteries. At the moment the cheapest way to operate is to continue using an internal combustion engine [which runs on diesel] and liquid fuel like hydrogen or ammonia that you have produced using renewable energy, according to Smith. Blending fuel is at the heart of CMBs strategy. Our diesel-hydrogen engines are a natural transition towards hydrogen. Diesel can still be burnt as principal fuel (in case no hydrogen is available), which gives users peace of mind to adopt this new technology, Saverys said. More companies should adopt transitional solutions, according to CDP. In its report, Carole Ferguson, head of investment research, said companies should focus on step change innovations. There are no zero carbon technologies that you can apply on ships today that are viable, said Kornerup. But we simply need to speed up [innovation] because we only have 11 years. The biggest barrier to achieving low-carbon shipping is cost. Hydrogen and other low-carbon fuels are much more expensive than diesel. A hydrogen-powered ship costs around $10-$15 million more to build than a diesel vessel, and the investment is hard to justify given the lack of incentives or regulation, according to Saverys. The technology is already here, said Smith. Whats lacking is the impetus.",03/10/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/10/03/business/global-shipping-climate-crisis-intl/index.html
Biden is creating a generational divide among black voters,"While polls suggest Joe Biden leads among black voters, please read the fine print. Although Barack Obamas vice president touts his African-American support by saying I think they know me, in reality that support is conditional, more specifically generational, and therefore flimsy and tenuous. Biden enjoys widespread support among older black adults, leaving some younger black voters to try to convince their parents and grandparents to change their ways and shift their vote for the 2020 election. Black millennials and Gen Z-ers are proactively attempting to sway their elder family members away from Biden and towards progressive candidates, as the New York Times reported in September. While its unclear if the attempt to specifically sway older black voters is working, according to an October Quinnipiac poll, Bidens support among black registered Democrats and Democratic-leaning independent voters has dropped 17 points since their July poll. Biden has downplayed this black generational gap, suggesting the votes of older and moderate blacks are all he may need to get him over the top. However, it should come as no surprise that Biden has a young black people problem. While his age, 76, has been mentioned as an issue, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are also in his age group  and yet their age, until Sanders recent heart attack, has not emerged as a factor. But what has proven a roadblock for Bidens support among young people of color is the shelf life of his mindset, his decades-old sentiments on race, society and politics that seem to lock him into the 1960s and 1970s. Add to that Bidens perceived persona of white moderation that tells black people we should move in baby steps rather than seek aggressive and immediate change. During the third Democratic debate, when asked about slavery and reparations, Biden responded with references to black parents unable to raise their children, and by telling them to make sure you have the record player on at night. At that moment, Biden sounded out of touch  more like a white man blaming black people for their oppression. While Obama sometimes lectured young black people, as he did during his 2013 commencement address to Morehouse College, he was able to get away with it because he was the black president, familiar with the hardships that black Americans face. And although Biden enjoys touting his proximity to Obama, it comes off as condescending when the former vice president addresses the black community about inequalities that plague it. When Biden recently spoke at an LGBTQ presidential forum, he appeared out of touch with present-day criminal justice realities by insisting yet again that his 1994 crime bill did not increase mass incarceration. That act was overwhelmingly supported by the African-American community, overwhelmingly supported by the community at large. Everyone from Ted Kennedy on voted for it. It did not have mandatory life sentences in it. That wasnt what it was about, Biden argued. Yes, the bill was supported by many black leaders at the time. And yes, studies have shown that incarceration rates were on a steady incline prior to the bill. But to repeatedly dismiss arguments that the bill had a role in increasing the mass incarceration rates, and how it continues to impact communities of color, is shortsighted. For young black voters the denial of the crime bills effects may bring to mind how it had a part in creating a flawed criminal justice system that allowed for the killers of Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner and Philando Castile to walk free while many people of color are serving lengthy prison sentences for doing far less. A tone-deaf Biden once said that young people  not specifically black  who think these days are as hard as the 1960s have no right to complain. The younger generation now tells me how tough things are  give me a break, he told the Los Angeles Times last year. No, no, I have no empathy for it, give me a break. Perhaps Biden would have more credibility had he not been one of the most ardent supporters of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, which makes it exceedingly difficult for people to discharge their student loan debt when they file for bankruptcy unless they can prove undue hardship. America is suffering from a $1.65 trillion student-debt crisis amid soaring tuition rates. Blacks are hit particularly hard, with 85% of black college students holding debt compared to 69% of white students. Black people owe an average of $34,000, which is $4,000 more than their white counterparts. And, according to the Brookings Institution, black students have three times the default rate. The racial wealth gap means black people have less accumulated wealth and borrow more than whites, and, as victims of institutional discrimination, are targeted by for-profit institutions. A new generation of black voters does not need lectures on parenting skills or how to win the contest for black respectability. Young black adults are spending their time supporting their families and raising their children. They are struggling against the impact of climate change that will hit their own communities hardest, while also fighting racial injustice and mass incarceration exacerbated by the 1994 crime bill Biden championed with pride. Not to mention, black voters are suffering from an historic loss of wealth since the Great Recession  a subprime mortgage crisis from which homeowners, unlike Wall Street, never received a bailout. When Biden speaks virtuously, as he did in June, of his history of compromising with white segregationist lawmakers, he harkens back to a time when black people were excluded and invisible. After some backlash, Biden first said that his comments on that were taken out of context, then he said he regretted the remarks. But for young black voters watching the recent rise of white nationalism, Bidens history of being civil with segregationists (his word) is alarming. As the 2020 election heats up, Biden may be feeling confident about securing the black vote, but it would be a mistake for him not to think about younger black voters, an influential part of this crucial voting bloc. For them, President Biden is not a solution to the social, economic and environmental issues that they face.",10/10/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/10/10/opinions/biden-generational-divide-black-voters-love/index.html
The majority of birds in North America face threat of extinction. Here? what we can do,"Its a bird emergency. And we can all be the first responders. Alarming new research by the National Audubon Society finds two-thirds of North American bird species  389 different species  are at risk of extinction from climate change. Many people were shocked by a recent, independent study that said nearly 3 billion birds have disappeared from the United States and Canada in the past half a century. And, if left unaddressed, Audubons new research predicts an even more frightening future. The good news to come from Audubons report is that there is still time to make a difference. If we take action now  by passing laws to facilitate our investments in, and use of, renewable energy  we can improve the chances for 76% of those at-risk species. Laws such as the Better Energy Storage Technology (BEST) Act have already been introduced by Congress. Now, the legislation must be passed so that we can start living as a more energy-conscientious society. Changes in precipitation and temperature, caused by climate change, disrupt places birds need to survive and thrive. Were seeing changes in the timing and growing pattern of plants, and that leads to wild fluctuations in insect and animal communities. That means birds could run out of places to live and food to eat. Climate change also intensifies existing threats for birds  and people  including extreme weather events that can wipe out entire nesting nurseries or winter flocks. As things stand, the iconic common loon could lose nearly 97% of the range it can occupy in the lower 48 states during the summer months. The Great gray owl could lose more than 97% of the places where it can survive. The piping plover could lose 87% of its habitable area in the summers, disappearing from most of the East Coast. Research shows that we must reach net-zero carbon released into the atmosphere by 2050 to slow and prevent the worst impacts of global warming. We know how to do that. Natural solutions like reforestation will absorb carbon pollution and restoring coastal wetlands will reduce the impact of storms and flooding. Supporting the research and development of technology for increasing energy efficiency such as large scale battery storage for backing up our energy sources and cutting down on emissions in the first place will also make a massive difference. Audubons bird and climate models are the first to include a comprehensive assessment of North Americas landscapes, including vegetation, agricultural land use and urbanization alongside a wealth of information on birds. Thanks to advances in big data, we created maps for 604 species of Northern American birds that show  down to one square kilometer  where birds may have to move to find the conditions they need to survive. That level of detail will allow for planners to make decisions about where to put buildings and infrastructure and where to invest in nature. We then looked at where birds are most at risk for dangers connected to climate change. We highlighted how threats like sea level rise and drought may compromise the birds habitats, creating insights on climate change in more detail than wed been able to observe before. Zip code by zip code, we can see how our communities and our birds could fare under various climate scenarios. We are already experiencing some of the signs of climate change: Sea levels have risen, causing more frequent flooding in Florida and other coastal areas. The seasons of fire in California and drought in the West are becoming more destructive. Humans and animals alike face the dangerous reality of stronger hurricanes in the Gulf and along the Atlantic coast. But there are thousands of smaller impacts related to climate change that are just as dangerous for individual species. For example, the glacier lily, a delicate yellow flower that blooms just after snowmelt in the Rocky Mountains, is an important food source for the broad-tailed hummingbird. Because of climate change, the lily is blooming earlier. The hummingbird is showing up at its usual time, exhausted and hungry from its spring migration, only to find one of its main foods has already finished blooming. Some birds will be able to adapt and colonize in new areas. Turkey Vultures and American Crows, for example, do well living among people and may be able to survive sharing our space. Others will not be able to adapt as quickly to the changes in their climate. Although birds may be able to fly somewhere else, landscapes cannot. As birds shift to find new locations, if the right habitat is not already established, they will not be able to thrive there. Birds like the bobolink, a grassland bird that nests in tall prairie grasses in Illinois and Minnesota, are predicted to move northward into the boreal forest. Its hard to tell if a grassland-dependent bird will be able to survive among trees. One of the most startling outcomes of Audubons study is that many birds that are doing well today, such as the American goldfinch, are going to be threatened by climate change in the future. Thats why any plan to address climate change must not only protect birds and human communities today, but protect them well into the future. We need legislation that aims to reduce emissions from every sector of the economy, and we must also begin to solve the technological problems that are obstacles to accomplishing that. Legislation like the BEST act would increase investments in research, development, and deployment of energy storage so renewable energy can be used regardless of when it is generated. Its an example of the kind of concrete, achievable action that is necessary to protect not only the homes of the birds we love, but the places we call home as well. The question is not can we do it, but rather: Will we do it?",26/10/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/10/26/opinions/audubon-birds-danger-of-extinction-climate-change-yarnold/index.html
California? new normal: How the climate crisis is fueling wildfires and changing life in the Golden State,"Its the new way of life in the Golden State. More than a dozen wildfires displace hundreds of thousands of Californians. Nearly 30 million people from California to Arizona wake up to red-flag warnings that signal conditions ripe for fire danger. Utilities throw entire communities into darkness in hopes of reducing the risks. More than 94,000 acres have already burned. Vast forests of dead trees have become tinderboxes. This is only the beginning, former California Gov. Jerry Brown told Politico this week. This is only a taste of the horror and terror that will occur in decades. But its happening now. Heres why deadlier and more destructive wildfires have become the new normal  and its all related to climate change: Hotter temperatures mean drier land. A parched atmosphere. Its that simple. In California, for instance, warm-season days have increased by 2.5 degrees since the early 1970s, according to a recent study published in the journal Earths Future. The clearest link between California wildfire and anthropogenic climate change thus far has been via warming-driven increases in atmospheric aridity, which works to dry fuels and promote summer forest fire, the report said. It is well established that warming promotes wildfire throughout the western US, particularly in forested regions, by enhancing atmospheric moisture demand and reducing summer soil moisture as snowpack declines. Park Williams, the studys lead author and a professor at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University, said human-caused warming of the planet has caused the vapor pressure deficit (VPD) to increase by 10% since the late 1800s, meaning that more evaporation is occurring. By 2060, he expects that effect to double. This is important because we have already seen a large change in California wildfire activity from the first 10%. Increasing the evaporation has exponential effects on wildfires, so the next 10% increase is likely to have even more potent effects, he told CNN in July. VPD  which measures dryness, or aridity, near the Earths surface  is directly related to the rate at which water is transferred from the land surface to the atmosphere. In the Southwest, average temperatures have increased by 1.6 degrees F since the early 1900s, according to the 2017 Climate Science Special Report by the US Global Change Research program. The California Department of Forestry & Fire Protection, or CalFire, called climate change a key driver of the trend of longer fire seasons. Warmer spring and summer temperatures, reduced snowpack, and earlier spring snowmelt create longer and more intense dry seasons that increase moisture stress on vegetation and make forests more susceptible to severe wildfire, CalFire said in its 2019 fire season outlook. In fact, fires are causing snow to melt earlier in the season across the western US in a cycle that triggers more fires, according to a paper published in May in the journal Nature Communications. Climate change has created conditions conducive to fueling the fires  such as drier air and plant life. In the fall, many California fires occur in coastal shrub lands and are driven by extreme wind events, such as the Santa Ana and Diablo winds. These strong offshore winds have very low humidity, which quickly dry vegetation on the ground and spread wildfires when they occur before the onset of winter precipitation. Wind increases the supply of oxygen which results in the fire burning more rapidly, Cal Fire spokeswoman Mary Eldridge said. It also removes the surface fuel moisture which increases the drying of fuel. What California officials once referred to as the fire season is now becoming the fire year. While wildfires are a natural part of Californias landscape, the fire season in California and across the West is starting earlier and ending later each year, according to Cal Fire. The length of fire season is estimated to have increased by 75 days across the Sierras and seems to correspond with an increase in the extent of forest fires across the state. Additionally, the risk of blazes grows as the fire season expands from the long, dry summer into the fall months with intense Santa Ana and Diablo wind events increasing the ability for rapid and dangerous spread. Disastrous drought conditions have converted forests into tinderboxes, leaving behind an apocalyptic landscape of dead trees  in the millions  and inviting bark-eating pests such as the Mountain Pine Beetle. Bark beetle infestations killed 7% of Western US forest area from 1979 to 2012, driven by winter warming due to climate change and by drought, according to the Fourth National Climate Assessment, a US government report. The ravenous beetles feed off nutrients found in bark, along the way releasing pheromones that attract swarms of fellow insects, according to experts. When enough beetles lay their eggs, reproducing in even greater masses, the trees become deprived of necessary nutrients. Climate change has contributed to the forest pest infestations, the report said  a major cause of tree death in Southwest forests and woodlands. The increased size of wildfires occurring across California in the last 50 years is attributable to climate change, according to the recent study published in Earths Future. Since the early 1970s, California wildfires have increased in size eightfold, the study said. The annual burned area has grown by nearly 500%. Increases in state-wide burned area over the last several decades were dramatically punctuated in 2017 and 2018 by particularly extreme wildfire activity with substantial loss of life and property, said Williams, the studys lead author. In 2017, almost 1.25 million acres were burned in California. That year, the Tubbs fire alone destroyed more structures than any previous wildfire in state history. One year later, the Mendocino Complex fire consumed 459,000 acres, making it the states largest wildfire in acreage. The cause of that fire is still under investigation. In these two years, the state spent over $1.5 billion, more than any previous two year period, the study said. Cal Fire said 13 of the 20 largest fires occurred during the summer. All but one happened in the last five decades. The World Meteorological Organization reported last year that the size of fires is growing. The northern part of the world is warming faster than the planet as a whole, the report said. That heat is drying out forests and making them more susceptible to burn.",29/10/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/10/29/weather/california-us-wildfires-climate-change/index.html
US begins formal withdrawal from Paris climate accord,"The Trump administration announced Monday that it will begin formally withdrawing the US from the Paris climate accord, the first step in a year-long process to leave the landmark agreement to reduce emissions of planet-warming gases. Today the United States began the process to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement. Per the terms of the Agreement, the United States submitted formal notification of its withdrawal to the United Nations. The withdrawal will take effect one year from delivery of the notification. After President Donald Trump said in 2017 that he intended to pull the US out of the agreement, the latest move is a procedural step that would lead to a complete withdrawal just after the 2020 presidential election. From replacing the Clean Power Plan to attempting to loosen fuel economy standards, it is another push from an administration that has made rolling back environmental regulations a top priority. It also sends a powerful message to the rest of the world: That as the damaging impacts of climate change become more apparent, the US  which according to a recent analysis has contributed more to global warming than any other country  will not be a part of the international charge to solve the crisis. The pullout follows acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaneys announcement that climate change will not be on the agenda at next years G7 summit  which the US is hosting  and Trumps absence from the conversation at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in September, where countries and businesses gathered to announce their plans to reduce emissions. Critics of the withdrawal say that the US leaving an agreement it helped negotiate will harm the countrys standing internationally. Our credibility is really at an all-time low on this when its most needed, said Andrew Light, a senior fellow at the World Resources Institute and a former State Department official who helped negotiate the Paris Agreement on behalf of the Obama administration. Ernest Moniz, the Obama administration energy secretary who worked on the agreement, called the move the latest step in the abandonment of American leadership to address the climate crisis. While efforts to curtail emissions continue in states and cities, the world needs us to play the key role in building broad coalitions and creating actionable frameworks to transition to a low-carbon global economy, Moniz said in a statement. Trump has blasted the Paris Agreement in the past, claiming it would punish American workers and enrich foreign countries. Proponents of the agreement, however, see the US withdrawal as a missed economic opportunity for American business. A 2016 report by the International Finance Corporation of the World Bank Group found that the Paris goals would open up an estimated $23 trillion in investment opportunities in developing markets through 2030. Critics say that with the US out of the market, the countrys chief competitors are stepping in. Under the framework of the agreement, Monday is the earliest date that the administration can notify the United Nations that the US plans to leave. But the process cannot be completed until exactly one year later on November 4, 2020, which happens to be one day after the 2020 presidential election. Should Trump lose the 2020 election, a new president could rejoin the agreement, but would have to put forth new climate commitments to the UN. The issue of addressing the climate crisis has already emerged as a top campaign issue for many 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, and the timing of the US withdrawal will likely keep the issue at the forefront. The administrations announcement comes at a time when signals indicate Trumps climate policy is increasingly at odds with public opinion, with polls showing that a majority of Americans are concerned about global warming. A poll conducted by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication earlier this year showed that about 7 in 10 Americans think global warming is happening, and at least 6 in 10 are somewhat worried about it. There is also the growing youth-led environmental movement that has drawn millions into the streets around the world to demand climate action from world leaders, another sign of growing global angst about the state of the planet. And in recent months, increasingly dire scientific reports have sounded alarm bells about the state of the planets oceans and polar regions. But on Monday, Pompeo said in his statement: In international climate discussions, we will continue to offer a realistic and pragmatic model  backed by a record of real world results  showing innovation and open markets lead to greater prosperity, fewer emissions, and more secure sources of energy.",04/11/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/04/politics/trump-formal-withdrawal-paris-climate-agreement/index.html
"11,000 scientists warn of ?ntold suffering?caused by climate change","How many scientists does it take to convince the world to take climate change seriously? More than 11,000 researchers from around the world on Tuesday issued a grim warning of the untold suffering that will be caused by climate change if humanity doesnt change its ways. The group said that as scientists, they have the moral obligation to tell it like it is. Phoebe Barnard, one of the lead authors of the report and the chief science and policy officer at the Conservation Biology Institute, a nonprofit science group, told CNN the report makes it clear theres no more wiggle room for policymakers. Posterity will remember them badly for dismissing climate change as a serious threat to our civilization, she said. Its not the first time thousands of academics united to urge people to take action on climate change. More than 16,000 scientists from 184 countries published a letter in 2017, warning that human beings and the natural world are on a collision course. The latest report was published in BioScience, a peer-reviewed scientific journal. The scientists, who come from over 150 countries, said the climate crisis is closely linked to excessive consumption of the wealthy lifestyle. Echoing the words of teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, the scientists have criticized policymakers for failing to take an action. Despite 40 years of global climate negotiations, with few exceptions, we have generally conducted business as usual and have largely failed to address this predicament, they said. They listed six key issues that need to be addressed if humanity wants to prevent the most catastrophic scenarios. These include replacing fossil fuels, cutting the emissions of climate pollutants such as methane and soot, eating less meat, restoring and protecting ecosystems, building a carbon-free economy and stabilizing population growth by investing into family-planning services and girls education. Barnard said the changes shouldnt be seen as sacrifices, but as a way of transforming things that we have found stressful. Everything from road rage and congestion and dirty air, she said.",05/11/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/05/world/climate-emergency-scientists-warning-intl-trnd/index.html
Italy to become first country to make learning about climate change compulsory for school students,"From next year, Italian school students in every grade will be required to study climate change and sustainability, in an attempt to position the country as a world leader in environmental education. Education Minister Lorenzo Fioramonti, of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, said all public schools will include about 33 hours a year in their curricula to study issues linked to climate change. The lessons will be built into existing civics classes, which will have an environmentalist footprint from September 2020, Vincenzo Cramarossa, Fioramontis spokesman, told CNN. The idea is that the citizens of the future need to be ready for the climate emergency, Cramarossa said. In addition, sustainable development will appear in more traditional subjects, such as geography, maths and physics, Cramarossa said. There will be more attention to climate change when teaching those traditional subjects, he explained. Fioramonti, an economics professor at South Africas Pretoria University, told Reuters in an interview that the entire ministry is being changed to make sustainability and climate the center of the education model. I want to make the Italian education system the first education system that puts the environment and society at the core of everything we learn in school, he said. Cramarossa said a panel of scientific experts, including Jeffrey D. Sachs, director of Columbia Universitys Center for Sustainable Development, and American economic and social theorist Jeremy Rifkin, will help the ministry redevelop the national curriculum to pay more attention to climate change and sustainability. Its a worlds first to have a (compulsory) national education in that sense, Cramarossa said. The Five Star Movement, to which Fioramonti belongs, has a history of environmental concern and grassroots activism. Since becoming minister, Fioramonti has been criticized by right-wing opposition parties for supporting striking students protesting climate change and backing taxes on plastic and sugary drinks.",06/11/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/06/europe/italy-climate-change-school-intl-scli-scn/index.html
Last month was the warmest October on record globally. Here? what it means for climate change,"As we rolled into November, scientists discovered last month was the warmest October on record globally. The European Unions Copernicus Climate Change Service, which analyzes temperature data from around the planet, said October 2019 was the warmest in their data record, which goes back to 1979. Globally, October was 0.69 degrees Celsius (1.24 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the average of all the Octobers in the 30-year span from 1981-2010, Copernicus said in its report. Last month narrowly edged out the previous record for October, set in 2015, by only 0.01 degrees Celsius (0.018 degrees Fahrenheit). Taking only European temperatures into account, October 2019 was the third-warmest going back to 1979. The same months in 2001 and 2006 were warmer, Copernicus said. The heat was spread out across the globe. Temperatures were much above average in large parts of the Arctic, while much of western USA and Canada experienced much below average temperatures, the report said. This year has seen multiple other hottest-month records, including July, which Copernicus said was the warmest month of all on record, replacing the record set in July 2016. Every month in 2019 has ranked among the four warmest for the month in question. According to Copernicus, 2016 through 2018 have been the three warmest calendar years on record. Monthly temperatures over the past 12 months have averaged close to 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.16 degrees Fahrenheit) over pre-industrial levels, Copernicus said. A report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in November 2018 warned of impacts to climate and weather if warming exceeds 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) over pre-industrial levels. Tuesdays report came the same day more than 11,000 researchers from around the world issued a grim warning of the untold suffering that will be caused by climate change if humanity doesnt change its ways. Copernicus assesses that since the 1970s the overall average rate of warming of the world is around 0.18 degrees Celsius (0.32 degrees Fahrenheit) per decade.",06/11/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/05/weather/warmest-october-temperatures-climate-trnd/index.html
"The climate crisis will profoundly affect the health of every child alive today, report says","The climate crisis is already hurting our health and it could burden generations to come with lifelong health problems, a new report finds. It could challenge already overwhelmed health systems and undermine much of the medical progress that has been made in the last century. If the world continues to produce the same amount of carbon emissions, a child born today could be living in a world with an average temperature thats 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius) warmer by their 71st birthday, according to the report, published Wednesday in the medical journal The Lancet. On any given day, a 7.2-degree difference might not sound like much, but as an average increase in temperature, it would be devastating for our health. A business as usual trajectory will result in a fundamentally altered world, the report says. The life of every child born today will be profoundly affected by climate change. Without accelerated intervention, this new era will come to define the health of people at every stage of their lives. A warmer world means more disease, famine, early death from natural disasters such as fire and heat waves, and more major mental health problems. Everyone will be affected, but the most vulnerable will be disproportionately threatened: children, the elderly, people with underlying health conditions and the poor. The public doesnt fully see this as a human health crisis. Maybe polar bears were our early indicator  the proverbial canary in the coal mine. But when you talk about this crisis, the bear images should be replaced with pictures of children, said Dr. Jonathan Patz, a professor and director of the Global Health Institute at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who was not involved with the new report. Children are suffering from the climate crisis. They are suffering with asthma, diarrheal disease, dengue fever. It is so important for the public to understand the climate crisis is absolutely a human health crisis. However, the report says, if the world takes bold action to curb carbon emissions, this dire future could be avoided. As an emergency medicine doctor, the hardest cases for me to help are the ones where dont have a treatment, but in this case, we have a treatment available, said Dr. Renee Sallas, a lead author on the report. Salas is a clinical instructor of emergency medicine at Harvard Medical School and an emergency medicine physician at Massachusetts General Hospital. The treatment was laid out in the Paris Climate Agreement goals. To limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, global greenhouse gas emissions have to be cut by at least 45% of 2010 levels by 2030. They had to get to net zero by 2050. Countries would need to take bold steps to get there, the report explains. A child born in London today would no longer use electricity generated by coal by their 6th birthday if the UK met its climate goal. A child born in France today wouldnt be driving a gas- or diesel-fueled car by their 21st birthday if the country met is climate goal. The report suggests there has been inadequate global progress. Worldwide coal production had been declining, for example, but from 2016 to 2018, the total primary energy supply from coal went up 1.7%. Subsidies for global fossil fuel consumption increased by 50% over the past 3 years. President Donald Trump has begun the United States formal withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement. In the US, carbon dioxide emissions rose by 2.8% in 2018  the largest increase since 2010, the report found. The world has yet to see a response from governments that matches the scale of the challenge, said Patz, a member of the National Academy of Medicine whose pioneering research has shown the health risks of the climate crisis. Prices for renewable energy sources make them competitive with fossil fuels, yet ironically this report shows too many countries still continue to subsidize fossil fuels, Patz said. That is very concerning. It is a time of urgency. And the health benefits from clean energy far outweigh the investment costs. The report did find some reasons to be hopeful. China, for instance, is continuing to reduce its reliance on coal to generate electricity. That country is the worlds largest carbon emitter. Europe saw improvements in air pollution levels from 2015 to 2016. Globally, more people are driving electric cars  increasing 20.6% between 2015 and 2016, and making up 1.8% of all of Chinas total transportation fuel use, the report found. Health systems are planning for the climate crisis, with 50% of countries saying they have plans and risk assessments in place to keep operating. Spending on adaptation funding for the health care system grew 11.8% over the past 12 months, the report found. And yet the climate crisis has already brought the world some serious health problems. Warmer temperatures make air pollution a much bigger problem, according to the report. Pollution damages your lungs, your heart and can negatively impact every other vital organ. The impact accumulates over time, leading to problems later in life, as well as causing problems like asthma in the immediate term. Already in 2016, there were 2.9 million premature premature deaths related to increasing pollution, the report found. With exposure to fine particulate air pollution, in 2016, 64,000 of these premature deaths were in the US. Previous reports have shown that the air quality is getting worse in the US, while the Trump administration has been weakening environmental regulations. As temperatures rise, there is more of a chance for disease to spread, the report found. In 2018, temperatures were already suitable for the spread of a particular kind of bacteria that causes much of the worlds wound infection and diarrheal disease. The same year was considered the second-most hospitable climate for the spread of dengue fever. Nine of the 10 most favorable years for the spread of this disease have happened since 2000, according to the report. Heatwaves became a problem for populations in every region from 1990 to 2018. In 2018 alone, there were 220 million heatwave exposures globally. Thats up from the previous record of 209 million exposures in 2015, according to the report. Heatwaves have gotten longer and more frequent and can significantly increase a persons risk of death from exposure. Infants, children, pregnant women and the elderly are particularly vulnerable to heat-related problems such as heatstroke, hyperthermia and heat exhaustion. Heatwaves also threaten workers. US workers, particularly those in agriculture and industry, lost nearly 1.4 billion potential labor hours between 2000-2018 and 81.4 million hours in 2018 alone from extreme heat, the report found. Wildfires also became a bigger problem from 2001 to 2014, and the threat is growing. In that time, 77% of countries saw an increase in the number of people exposed to wildfires, the report found. Its important to keep in mind: There are not just the immediate risks from wildfires  including death and displacement  but there are more long-term consequences from breathing these air pollutants, including heart and lung disease, said Dr. Caren Solomon, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a physician at Brigham and Womens Hospital. There are also associations with adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as premature birth  not to mention major mental health effects. Solomon did not work on this report but has done other work on climate change and health. Often these issues dont get a lot of attention as it relates to climate change, she said. We focus on the immediate, but these have negative health consequences long term. More than 120 experts from 35 agencies and institutions from all around the world worked on the new report. Scientists hope that policymakers will use this annual assessment of the climate crisis to prevent this serious threat to public health. I think raising awareness through rigorous science can only benefit policymakers and the public at large, as it could lead to sound policy that would be feasible from a political standpoint. This report contributes to this important discussion, said Todd Pugatch, an associate professor at Oregon State University, who did not work on the report. Pugatchs research on the climate crisis found that natural disasters will likely become 52% more deadly if the climate crisis sees the worst case scenario. The more we contribute to this rigorous evidence base of the real threat of the climate crisis, hopefully, it will have a policy impact, he said.",13/11/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/13/health/climate-change-health-study/index.html
Many countries pledged to cut emissions of heat-trapping gases. A report shows most are still investing in fossil fuels,"Keep it in the ground has long been a favorite slogan of the environmental movement aimed at the coal, oil and gas industries, and the catchphrase is based in science. For years, scientists have warned that without shifting energy consumption from fossil fuels to renewable sources, the planet will experience potentially disastrous levels of global warming. But a new report shows that many of the worlds governments are not heeding their calls, and its jeopardizing global efforts to contain the climate crisis. In fact, countries are on track to produce far more fossil fuels than what scientists say is allowed in order to limit global warming to 1.5 or even 2 degrees Celsius, according to a major new United Nations (UN) analysis titled The Production Gap. The discrepancy between national policies  that is, climate change policies and fossil fuel production policies  highlights that there is much more that needs to be done both at the country level and in international climate negotiations to pay a sharpened and increased focus on fossil fuels, said Niklas Hagelberg, the UN Environment Programs climate change coordinator. Exactly how far out of line is fossil fuel production with goals set to limit global warming? Right now, governments are expected to produce 120% more fossil fuels by 2030 than what scientists say is permissible to keep the planet from warming 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), and 50% more than what we can burn to keep warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). Of the fossil fuels, the report found that coal production is the furthest off track  the world is expected to produce 150% more coal in 2030 than is allowed to keep global warming to no more than 2 degrees. The United Nations Environment Programs previous annual reports have served as a report card showing whether countries are hitting their benchmarks for reducing emissions. This report is the first to look at the supply side of the energy and climate equation. It examines whether plans for future fossil fuel production are in line with global pledges to reduce the release of heat-trapping gases. The findings suggest the actions of many countries dont match their words: While some say they plan to decrease their emissions, many are still building and investing in new fossil fuel projects. The authors propose several policy options to rein in production, such as placing limits on exploration and extraction of new fuel sources and ending subsidies for fossil fuels. A lot of extraction projects wouldnt be economical without government support, so phasing out this support will make oil and gas uneconomical, and will level the playing field for renewable energy, said Ivetta Gerasimchuk, a lead for sustainable energy supplies at the International Institute for Sustainable Development in Geneva and one of the authors of the report. The report highlights the initiatives of several countries  such as Belize, Costa Rica, France, Denmark and New Zealand  that have already enacted partial or total bans on new oil or gas projects. Others, such as Germany and Spain, have taken action to stop coal mining. These findings come at a pivotal time for the future of the planet. Under the rules of the landmark 2015 Paris climate accord, countries are supposed to increase their commitments to reduce emissions of planet-warming gases every five years. Countries are expected to submit the first of these updated pledges by the end of 2020. Early next month, delegates from around the world plan to gather in Madrid for the next round of UN climate talks, and these revised pledges, which are due next year, will be a key focus of the summit. So far, 68 countries have stated their intent to enhance their commitments, but those countries represent just 8% of global emissions. The Madrid summit also comes as one of the key contributors to climate change  the United States  has signaled it is stepping away from international efforts to stem the crisis. Earlier this month, the Trump administration announced it had begun the formal process of withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, despite reports produced by the US government showing climate change will shrink the economy and lead to thousands of deaths.",20/11/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/20/world/climate-change-un-production-gap-report-2019/index.html
Toys to tackle climate change: A young inventor wants to inspire kids to create their own solutions,"In a remote community in Northern Canada, beside the Arctic Ocean, is a beach encrusted with burnt trash  plastic, glass, batteries, compost and all kinds of detritus. When a young inventor stumbled upon the desecrated coastline during a 2017 expedition to the region, she cried at the sight. That was really moving for me, says Ann Makosinski, 22. Theres obviously much worse pollution around the world, but seeing it right in front of you and in your own country was really terrifying. Find out more about Call to Earth and the extraordinary people working for a more sustainable future It left her wanting to play a part in protecting the environment. The following year, back at her workspace in Victoria, on the southern tip of Vancouver Island, she hit upon an idea. She started work on a range of toys to teach kids about renewable energy. The cute, brightly colored characters make sounds, spin or light up when they are run underwater, placed in the sun or wound up, to demonstrate different ways of generating power. I just want, especially young kids, to feel like they can invent their own solutions and they dont have to wait for other people to make them, she says. I want to inspire people to be more creative with the resources they have around them. Makosinski was an unusual child. She didnt watch television, play video games or have a cellphone. Instead, she spent her time listening to opera, watching silent movies and learning to play the piano and violin. Her first toy was a box of transistors. I wasnt given many toys, so I had to make my own, she says. I would take garbage and my hot glue gun from around the house and piece together these so-called inventions, and obviously they never worked, but the idea of taking things from around me and piecing them together to make something better just kind of came really naturally. Aged 16, she won the 2013 Google Science Fair with a flashlight that runs on heat from a human hand  inspired by a friend in the Philippines who was failing school because her family couldnt afford electricity to light a room for her to study in.

Her TEDxTeen Talk, Why I dont use a smart phone, has now been watched more than two million times. Read: Indian student creates brick made from recycled plastic Makosinski only bought her first phone, an old-fashioned flip model, at the age of 18. She believes that not having the distraction of technology in her pocket gave her the space and time to be creative, and connect better  she calls her friends, from a landline. But as she entered adulthood, Makosinski began to feel burnt out. She struggled to obtain patents for her inventions, and although she had approaches from manufacturers, creating enough energy from body heat to compete with batteries was a huge challenge. I just wasnt sure anymore of what I wanted to do or who I was, she says. My main passion was for just tinkering, it wasnt necessarily inventions and getting money, it was tinkering, making things. To her parents dismay, Makosinksi turned down an engineering scholarship and began an English Literature degree. But her interest in the arts led her to a more imaginative way of using her thermoelectric technology. After finally gaining two patents for her technology early this year, she has employed it in her unique range of toys designed to educate children about the environment. Its just putting it in a different packaging, its just taking a different form, she explains. I really believe that the toy line is a better idea at the current moment with the technology. She hopes the toys will go on the market next year and plans to eventually hire a team of metallurgists and engineers to work on scaling the technology to deliver the flashlight to people who need it at an affordable price. That was always my goal, to be able to distribute it or partner with an NGO so anyone who bought a flashlight here in America could be giving one to someone who needed electricity. Read: Deadly mudslide inspires teenager to protect the environment In the meantime, she wants children to understand that she is just a normal girl who just used her time differently after school  and that they could do the same. Makosinski traces her recent recalibration to jumping into the freezing water during that emotional Arctic expedition. Your mind just goes blank and then you start getting all these pins and needles like the water scratching you because its so cold, and your blood is rushing, she says. The things that scare me the most and intimidate me ... I dont even know what I might be missing out on until I do them. In that ice-cold sea, her uncertainties melted away. She was ready to show the next generation the path she had discovered.",25/11/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/25/world/ann-makosinski-toys-scn-intl-c2e/index.html
"Countries are not doing enough to keep Earth? temperature from rising to near-catastrophic levels, a UN report says","A new United Nations report paints a bleak picture: The commitments countries pledged to limit the climate crisis are nowhere near enough to stave off record-high temperatures. Delaying change any further will make it impossible to reach desired temperature goals. The time for rapid and transformational change to limit global warming is now, the report says. The UN Environment Program (UNEP) 2019 Emissions Gap report calls on countries to strengthen the commitments made in the 2015 Paris Agreement to stall climate change. Current measures will not keep global temperature increases within the 1.5-to-2-degree Celsius range (a safe level to which temperatures can rise and not cause devastation, though 1.5 degrees is preferable), according to the report issued Tuesday. Greenhouse gases reached a record high in 2018 with no sign of peaking, according to a World Meteorological Organization report released Monday. Carbon dioxide levels reached 407.8 parts per million, a unit used to measure the level of a contaminant in the air. At the current rate, temperatures are expected to rise 3.2 degrees Celsius (5.8 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100, the UNEP report states. The changes the UNEP suggests are extreme: To get Earth back on track to the 1.5-degree goal, countries must multiply their commitment level, or the level at which they pledge to reduce their emissions, five times the current rates outlined in the Paris accords. That means global greenhouse gas emissions must fall at least 7.6% every year to remove 32 gigatons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Incremental change is no longer enough to stall off the potentially devastating effects of a changing climate, the reports authors write. What the world needs now, they say, is rapid and transformational action. Septembers UN Climate Action Summit saw some commitment from countries to advance their carbon neutrality efforts. But most of the G20 nations were visibly absent from the events, and their likely impact on emissions gap will be insufficient, the report said. G20 countries account for 78% of global greenhouse gas emissions, but only five of 20 member countries have set a date to reach net-zero emissions by. Of those, only two have created legislation to enforce those goals. The US leads G20 countries in per-capita emissions, excluding greenhouse gases from land use, at just above 20 tons of carbon dioxide per capita in 2018. When it completes the withdrawal process in 2020, the US will be the only country in the world to not have signed onto the Paris Climate Accords. And 2020 is a critical year for climate change: Countries will renegotiate their commitments at the UN climate change conference in Glasgow, but theyll have to take extensive action to avert a future crisis, said Anne Olhoff, the head of strategy in the UNEPs climate planning and policy division. They need to be significantly strengthened if we are to bridge or narrow the gap, she told CNN. Some progress has been made in the years since the Paris Agreement: Six G20 member countries are projected to meet the commitments they made  which means they have room to raise the ceiling for carbon removal even higher. But drivers like economic growth, which is substantially higher than what was initially expected when the Paris Agreement was created, and population growth have more than outweighed good progress made on climate action, she said. The report outlines some essential changes to chip away at emissions, including decarbonizing transport. Few countries have sufficient policies and actions in place to achieve this measure, Olhoff said, but establishing vehicle emission standards and investing in public transportation that runs on electricity are possible, if expensive, steps toward it. Pricing carbon  making major polluters pay for their emissions  provides an incentive for major emitters to reduce their output. Its often calculated from the price they extract from the public in terms of environmental damage or health care costs, though the countries that have already implemented this measure would need to hike up the cost, per the report. Another measure, phasing out coal power plants, is more realistic now, Olhoff said. Renewable energy technology is increasingly affordable, with utility-scale solar power and wind turbines within competitive price of the operating costs of existing coal plants. Theres really no big argument for not going full-force at renewable energy, she said. Environmental recalibration will require fundamental structural changes across most of the world, the report acknowledges. It wont be cheap. Climate policies consistent with the 1.5-degree goal could cost up to $3.6 trillion per year globally, according to the UNEP. But the cost likely outweighs the consequences of inaction. The adaptations humankind would need to make to survive in a world where temperatures have risen more than 1.5 degrees Celsius would seriously damage the global economy and reduce food security and biodiversity, according to the report. Whats more, delaying action further would force global powers to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at a magnitude that current technology and resources havent caught up with yet, the report warns. Climate protection and adaptation investments will become a precondition for peace and stability, the reports authors write, and will require unprecedented efforts to transform nearly every sector of society. Theres growing demand from the public to see those changes implemented, Olhoff said. The difficult part is executing change in such a way that doesnt disrupt society completely. Its worked for some: Olhoff offered South Africa as an example, as its made gradual but important progress in phasing out coal power plants. But in India, where coal leads the energy market and powers the economy, a change that drastic would result in social upheaval. If we want to be serious about limiting global warming, we need to act now and we need to take it seriously, she said.",26/11/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/26/us/climate-change-un-emissions-report-2019-trnd/index.html
"Climate crisis pushing Earth to a ?lobal tipping point,?researchers say","The Earth is heading toward a global tipping point if the climate crisis continues on its current path, scientists have warned, as they called for urgent action to avoid an existential threat to civilization. The group of researchers, who published a commentary in the journal Nature, say there is growing evidence to suggest that irreversible changes to the Earths environmental systems are already taking place, and that we are now in a state of planetary emergency. A global tipping point is a threshold when the planets systems go beyond the point of no return  such as the loss of the Amazon rainforest, accelerated melting of ice sheets, and thawing of permafrost  the authors of the commentary say. Such a collapse could lead to hothouse conditions that would make some areas on Earth uninhabitable. We argue that the intervention time left to prevent tipping could already have shrunk towards zero, whereas the reaction time to achieve net zero emissions is 30 years at best, the authors said. Led by Timothy Lenton, professor of climate change and Earth system science at the University of Exeter, in southwest England, the team identified nine areas where they say tipping points are already underway. Those include widespread destruction of the Amazon, reduction of Arctic sea ice, large-scale coral reef die-offs, melting of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets, thawing of permafrost, destabilizing of boreal forests  which contain vast numbers of trees that grow in freezing northern climes  and a slowdown of ocean circulation. The team claims that these events are interconnected and change in one will impact another, causing a worsening cascade of crises. For example, the Arctic is warming at least twice as quickly as the global average. Melting Arctic sea ice is driving warming further because less heat is reflected off the planet. That regional warming is leading to an increased thawing of Arctic permafrost, soil that stays frozen throughout the year, which is releasing carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. The warming has triggered large-scale insect disturbances and fires in North American boreal forests potentially turning some regions from a carbon sink to a carbon source, the team said. The researchers said early results from preliminary models suggest the climate is much more sensitive than first thought and that a global tipping point is possible. Research last year analyzed 30 types of regime shift spanning physical climate and ecological systems, from collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet to a switch from rainforest to savanna, they added. This indicated that exceeding tipping points in one system can increase the risk of crossing them in others. The idea of a climate tipping point is not new. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) introduced the concept 20 years ago. Back then, the UN suggested such large-scale discontinuities would only come about when global warming exceeded 5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. But the authors say data from the two most recent IPCC reports in 2018 and September 2019, suggest tipping points can happen between 1 C and 2 C of warming. Global average temperatures are today around 1 C higher than in the pre-industrial age and continue to rise. One report from 2018  of which Lenton was part of  suggested that a domino effect will kick in if global temperatures rise more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The model highlighted the consequences of how the interactions between a variety of climate change factors, such as the loss or weakening of carbon sinks, forest dieback, ice retreat and increased bacteria respiration, could combine to form a feedback loop which accelerates climate change. The authors acknowledge that there are limits to their understanding of climate tipping, and further investigation is needed. But they say the possible impact could be so huge and irreversible that to err on the side of danger is not a responsible option. In other words, not acting is too risky to bet against in their view. And time is of the essence. While the 2015 Paris Agreement set a goal to limit the Earths warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, a UN report this month said that pledges countries made to limit the climate crisis are nowhere near enough to stave off record-high temperatures. The UN Environment Program (UNEP) 2019 Emissions Gap report said at the current rate, temperatures are expected to rise 3.2 C by 2100. Greenhouse gases reached a record high in 2018 with no sign of peaking, according to a recent World Meteorological Organization report. Carbon dioxide levels reached 407.8 parts per million, a unit used to measure the level of a contaminant in the air. Hope is not lost, however. Researchers say that mitigating greenhouse gas emissions could still slow down the accumulation of these climate impacts. What is needed, they say, is urgent international action to cut emissions, slow sea level rise, and to keep warming to 1.5 C. A saving grace is that the rate at which damage accumulates from tipping  and hence the risk posed  could still be under our control to some extent, they said. The stability and resilience of our planet is in peril. International action  not just words  must reflect this.",28/11/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/28/health/climate-crisis-global-tipping-point-intl-hnk/index.html
"In the fight against climate change, no one can stand on the sidelines","When I think of the incredible challenges we must confront in the face of a changing climate, my mind focuses on young people. Eventually, they will be the ones either to enjoy the fruits or bear the burdens resulting from actions taken today. I think of my 9-year-old granddaughter. By the time she turns 20, she may be witness to climate change so profound that it pushes an additional 100 million people into poverty. By the time she turns 40, 140 million may become climate migrants  people forced to flee homes that are no longer safe or able to provide them with livelihoods. And if she lives to be 90, the planet may be 3 to 4 degrees hotter and barely livable. Unless we act. We can avoid this bleak future, and we know what we have to do  reduce emissions, offset what cannot be reduced and adapt to new climate realities. No individual or institution can stand on the sidelines. Our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through various mitigation measures  phasing out fossil fuels, increasing energy efficiency, adopting renewable energy sources, improving land use and agricultural practices  continue to move forward, but the pace is too slow. We have to scale up and accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy. At the same time, we must recognize that climate change is already happening and affecting the lives of millions of people. There are more frequent and more severe weather-related events  more droughts, more floods, more heat waves, more storms. Ready or not, we are entering an age of adaptation. And we need to be smart about it. Adaptation is not a defeat, but rather a defense against what is already happening. The right investments will deliver a triple dividend by averting future losses, spurring economic gains through innovation, and delivering social and environmental benefits to everyone, but particularly to those currently affected and most at risk. Updated building codes can ensure infrastructure and buildings are better able to withstand extreme events. Making agriculture more climate resilient means investing more money in research and development, which in turn opens the door to innovation, growth and healthier communities. The IMF is stepping up its efforts to deal with climate risk. Our mission is to help our members build stronger economies and improve peoples lives through sound monetary, fiscal and structural policies. We consider climate change a systemic risk to the macroeconomy and one in which the IMF is deeply involved through its research and policy advice. On the mitigation side of the equation, this means intensifying our work on carbon pricing and helping governments craft roadmaps as they navigate their way from brown economies dependent on carbon to green ones that strive to be carbon free. Carbon taxes are one of the most powerful and efficient tools at their disposal  the latest IMF analysis finds that large emitting countries need to introduce a carbon tax that rises quickly to $75 a ton in 2030, consistent with limiting global warming to two degrees Celsius or less. But carbon taxes must be implemented in a careful and growth-friendly fashion. The key is to retool the tax system in fair, creative and efficient ways  not just add a new tax. A good example is Sweden, where low- and middle-income households received higher transfers and tax cuts to help offset higher energy costs following the introduction of a carbon tax. This is a path others can follow, strategically directing part of the revenues that carbon taxes generate back to low-income households that can least afford to pay. With the revenues estimated at 1% to 3% of GDP, a portion could also go to support firms and households that choose green pathways. While we continue to work to reduce carbon emissions, the increasing frequency of more extreme weather like hurricanes, droughts and floods is affecting people all across the world. Countries already vulnerable to natural disasters suffer the most, not only in terms of immediate loss of life, but also in long-lasting economic effects. In some countries, total economic losses exceed 200% of GDP  as when Hurricane Maria struck Dominica in 2017. Our emergency lending facilities are designed to provide speedy assistance to low-income countries hit by disasters. But the IMF also works across various fronts on the adaptation side to help countries address climate-related challenges and be able to price risk and provide incentives for investment, including in new technologies. We support resilience-building strategies, particularly in highly vulnerable countries to help them prepare for and rebound from disasters. And we contribute to building capacity within governments through training and technical assistance to better manage disaster risks and responses. We work with other organizations to increase the impact of our climate work. One of our most important partnerships is with the World Bank, in particular on climate change policy assessments. Together, we take stock of countries mitigation and adaption plans, risk management strategies and financing and point to gaps where those countries need investment, policy changes or help in building up their capacity to take the necessary action. Moving forward, we must also be open to stepping in where and when our expertise can help, and there are other areas where we will be gearing up our work. For example, we will be working more closely with central banks, which, as guardians of both financial and price stability, are now adapting regulatory frameworks and practices to address the multifaceted risks posed by climate change. Many central banks and other regulators are seeking ways to improve climate risk disclosure and classification standards, which will help financial institutions and investors better assess their climate-related exposures  and help regulators better gauge systemwide risks. The IMF is offering support by working with the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System and other standard-setting bodies. Central banks and regulators should also help banks, insurers and nonfinancial firms assess their own exposures to climate risk and develop climate-related stress tests. Such tests can help identify the likely impact of a severe adverse climate-driven shock on the solvency of financial institutions and the stability of the financial system. The IMF will help push forward efforts around climate change stress testing, including through our own assessments of countries financial sectors and economies. Careful calibration of stress testing for climate change will be needed, because such testing requires assessing the effects of shocks or policy actions that may have little historical precedent. All these efforts will help ensure that more money will flow into low-carbon, climate-resilient investments. The rapid increase of green bonds is a positive trend, but much more is required to secure our future. It is that simple: We all need to intensify our efforts to work together to exchange knowledge and ideas, to formulate and implement policies and to finance the transition to the new climate economy. Our children and grandchildren are counting on us.",30/11/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/30/perspectives/climate-change-imf/index.html
"Warming temperatures put women at risk of giving birth early, study says","Women are at risk of giving birth early due to warmer temperatures brought on by the climate crisis, a new study finds. The study, published Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change, found that on days when temperatures soar past 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32.2 degrees Celsius), birth rates increase 5%. Births rates are also elevated on the following day, perhaps because labor and delivery continued into the next day, the study said. After temperatures drop, birth rates decrease. A 5% increase may not sound like much, but the authors estimate that over a 20-year period, an average of 25,000 infants per year were born earlier in the United States as a result of warm temperatures. That equates to a loss of more than 150,000 gestational days annually in the United States from 1969 to 1988. Researchers think this is likely an undercount. The average reduction in gestational length is about 6.1 days, the study found, but in some cases, babies were born up to two weeks early. Previous studies have found that mothers face an increased risk of preeclampsia, hypertension and other health problems with higher temperatures. During a babys last weeks in the womb, theres dramatic maturation in the brain and rapid physical growth. Studies have shown that babies born early have a higher risk of diseases such as asthma, higher risk of developmental delays and greater risk the child will need to be hospitalized early on in life. The study doesnt explain the connection between extreme heat and earlier births. Studies in animals have shown that heat stress can increase the amount of oxytocin a mother produces. In human mothers, levels of this neuropeptide increase when labor begins. Another theory is that extreme heat might cause earlier deliveries due to cardiovascular stress. Other studies have noted the negative connections between warmer temperatures and births in both humans and in animals. This large study encompassed 56 million births. Instead of using gestational length records, which could be misreported, the authors looked at daily birth rates, which tend to be more accurate. They also factored in regional temperature differences, the study said. With the climate crisis expected to bring more extremely hot days, early births could become a much bigger problem in the United States and around the world. This study looked at data from 1969 to 1988. There have been many more record-breaking hot days since then and more are expected in the future, if the world doesnt cut carbon emissions and prevent further warming. According to climate projections, the new study says, there could be additional 250,000 gestational days lost every year by the end of the century.",02/12/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/12/02/health/climate-crisis-early-births-study/index.html
"Climate change is forcing one person from their home every two seconds, Oxfam says","Climate-fueled disasters have forced about 20 million people a year to leave their homes in the past decade  equivalent to one every two seconds  according to a new report from Oxfam. This makes the climate the biggest driver of internal displacement for the period, with the worlds poorer countries at the highest risk, despite their smaller contributions to global carbon pollution compared to richer nations. People are seven times more likely to be internally displaced by floods, cyclones and wildfires than volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, and three times more likely than by conflict, according to the report released Monday, The issue is one of a raft of topics set to be discussed at the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP 25, which starts on Monday in Madrid. Oxfam is calling on the international community to do more to fund recovery programs for poorer countries affected by the climate emergency, which is set to intensify as extreme weather events are projected to increase in both severity and frequency. Low- and lower-middle income nations, such as India, are more than four times more likely to be affected by climate-fueled displacement than high-income countries like Spain and the US, according to the report. Geography also plays a role, with about 80% of those displaced living in Asia. Small island developing states (SIDS), such as Cuba, Dominica and Tuvalu, are particularly badly affected, making up seven of the top 10 countries with the highest rates of displacement from extreme weather disasters between 2008 and 2018. People living in SIDs are 150 times more likely to be displaced by extreme weather disasters than those living in Europe, according to the report, which analyzed 2008-18 data from the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre. Internal displacement has a social cost as well as a financial one, according to Tim Gore, Oxfams head of policy on climate and food justice. Its always the poorest, the most vulnerable, and women in particular, that are worst affected, Gore, who worked on the report, told CNN. This kind of displacement really tears at the social fabric of communities. There is more acute risk in those countries where extreme weather and conflict combine, such as Somalia, said Gore. Sudden extreme weather events such as cyclones grab a lot of attention, but slow onset phenomena like rising sea levels also have an impact, he added. For example, floods affecting agricultural land in low lying coastal areas can leave it unusable for farming, pushing inhabitants to leave the area for good. Oxfam is calling on world leaders to reduce emissions as fast as possible. Developing countries are also set to push for support from developed countries through a financial mechanism to deal with loss and damage. First discussed at a climate summit in Warsaw in 2013, such a mechanism will involve richer countries financially helping poorer countries to deal with the impact of climate change. Nobody has been prepared to talk about money and so thats one of the critical issues that will be on the table in Madrid, said Gore. Ultimately somebody is going to have to pay the price for these impacts and at the moment that price is being paid by the poorest communities in the world. And while current data shows lower risk in developed nations, projections suggest that is set to change. Rich countries are not immune either from the threat of displacement, said Gore. Climate change is not going to discriminate. Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, told CNN that increasing numbers of internally displaced people can be attributed in part to a growing population living in high-risk areas. Displacement can also be a measure of success in some cases, he added, citing early warning systems that allow people to get out of danger before an extreme weather event hits, avoiding the major loss of life that has occurred in the past. Ward also emphasized that climate-fueled displacement is a security issue. Although its hard to show that climate change is in itself creating political instability and conflict, the way in which the national security community describes climate change is as a threat multiplier, he said. When you get large populations displaced thats when you get instability and conflict.",02/12/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/12/01/world/oxfam-climate-displacement-intl-scli/index.html
"Without Trump? help, America? other leaders go it alone in the fight against climate change","President Donald Trumps move to begin pulling out of the Paris Agreement last month signaled to world leaders that the US government is stepping away from the global push to stop the climate crisis. But as world leaders gather in Madrid this week to refine their pledges to cut heat-trapping gases, a large group of US cities, states, universities and businesses remain committed to holding global warming below 2 degrees Celsius. Their message to the world? That the US is still fighting to avoid the worst consequences of climate change. And despite the policies of this administration, a new report shows that this broad coalition is significantly reducing US greenhouse gas emissions and even deeper cuts are possible with or without federal help. The report titled Accelerating Americas Pledge finds that policies already in place by state, local and business actors can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. This current coalition of the willing represents 68% of US gross domestic product, which would make it the worlds second largest economy, second to only the US economy itself, according to the report. We can say to the international community, Hey, you guys hear a lot about whats not happening in the US, but what you might not know is that there is a tremendous amount of activity that can actually make a difference in terms of overall US emissions, said Nate Hultman, director of the Center for Global Sustainability at the University of Maryland and the lead author of the report. The authors of the report  which was produced by the Americas Pledge initiative led by Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg and former California Gov. Jerry Brown  found that even more significant cuts are possible with further shifts toward renewable energy, improved efficiency in buildings and transportation, and protection of forests and other carbon-storing ecosystems. If state and local governments along with the private sector further enhanced their climate commitments, overall US emissions could fall even further by 37% by 2030, the study found. But the report shows that to get the US within striking distance of its Paris Agreement goals, executive and legislative action will be required. The report comes as state and local actors try to carry on the fight to halt climate change without federal support and reflects both the potential and limits of this current bifurcated US climate policy. At this weeks United Nations 25th Conference of Parties (COP25) in Madrid  where countries are attempting to iron out more aggressive commitments to slash emissions of planet-warming gases  there is an interesting dynamic at play, with two groups representing US interests on the ground. A delegation of State Department and other federal officials sent by the Trump administration is in Madrid for the negotiations, where they plan to ... ensure a level playing field that protects US interests, according to a State Department statement. But there is a second group from the US in Madrid  a band of lawmakers, city and state officials, plus private sector and educational leaders  seeking to fill the void of leadership they say has been left by the Trump administration. Their goal is to convince the rest of the world that the US is still in the fight to avert the worst consequences of climate change. Last Monday at the start of the talks, US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi led a group of Democratic lawmakers to Madrid to reaffirm the commitment of the American people to combating the climate crisis. On Friday, the US Climate Action Center opened in Madrid with a slate of speakers and events. During COP25, the action center will serve as a hub for an array of US leaders planning to show other countries the steps they are taking to combat the climate crisis. Throughout the course of history, the US has been seen as a leader. And with an issue as pressing as this one, we shouldnt take a backseat to anybody, said Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, who is representing the US Climate Alliance, a bipartisan coalition of governors committed to the Paris Agreement goals. In the absence of federal action to address the climate crisis, this has become the new normal. At the past two major gatherings of climate negotiators (COP23 and COP24) since Trump came into office, this alliance has set up shop on the sidelines separate from the federal delegation. Still, their goal of convincing the world that the country is taking the threat of global warming seriously will not be easy. The US has left the last two international climate agreements and remains the worlds second-largest contributor of planet-warming gases. One of the major concerns I think is the way that the US has participated in these talks  being in and being out, and then being in and being out, said Elan Strait, director of US climate campaigns at the World Wildlife Fund. The rest of the world is obviously very tired of that. Both in the US presidential election and at next years COP26 in Glasgow, the stakes are high when it comes to the fate of the planet. The Madrid meetings this week are the last major negotiations before 2020, the year when the Paris agreement goes into effect. When nations signed the deal back in 2015, they agreed global emissions of greenhouse gases must peak by 2020 and then start falling or the world will face disastrous and irreversible damage. Ahead of COP26, many countries will need to increase their commitments to cut emissions to get on track to meet the Paris goals. A recent United Nations report showed that the current commitments are not enough to stave off catastrophic levels of global warming. Though the US has formally withdrawn from the Paris accord, under the agreements framework, the process cannot be completed until November 4, 2020, which happens to be the day after the 2020 presidential election. Should Trump lose, a new president could rejoin the agreement, but would need to commit the US to cutting its heat-trapping gas emissions even further.",09/12/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/12/09/politics/cop25-trump-climate-change-accelerating-america-pledge-report/index.html
Climate change could wipe $2.3 trillion off global stocks,"Policies designed to combat climate change could permanently slash the value of companies around the world by up to $2.3 trillion. Thats according to a new report from Principles for Responsible Investment that examines how inevitable policies such as banning internal combustion engines will affect stock prices. The analysis concludes that up to $2.3 trillion, or 4.5%, could be wiped off the value of companies listed on a global stock index from MSCI. The report was prepared by Vivid Economics and Energy Transition Advisers. But there are also opportunities for investors. Companies that adapt to changing policies would see their combined share prices increase by hundreds of billions of dollars, according to the UN-backed group. Principles for Responsible Investment is supported by nearly 2,600 asset owners and investors that have a combined $86 trillion of assets under management. Investors from around the world are putting more pressure on companies over climate change, asking them to be more transparent about the risks to their business from extreme and changing weather. Many climate change experts have gathered this week in Madrid to attend the COP25 conference. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said Sunday that the summit marks the point of no return on climate. The report from Principles for Responsible Investment looks at how valuations would be affected if climate policies changed by 2025. However, policies could change at any time, the authors warn. The energy sector is expected to be hit the hardest by the shift, followed by autos and utilities. The changing policy landscape will be driven by bans on internal combustion engines that are expected by 2035, as well as carbon pricing and the phasing out of coal. The report assumes more power generation from low carbon sources, including nuclear energy. Energy companies stand to shed nearly 33% off their value, according to the report, with the 10 largest oil and gas producers losing $500 billion of their combined market caps. Within the energy sector, upstream businesses, which are focused on finding and extracting fossil fuels, will bear the brunt of the pain. When it comes to mining companies, the value of coal producers could be nearly halved. Carmakers that shift to electric vehicles and utilities with a strategy for greener alternatives could more then double their valuations, according to Fiona Reynolds, CEO of the Principles for Responsible Investment. Similarly, producers of solar and wind energy equipment will also likely go up in value as demand increases. The report suggests that investors should have a good look at how their portfolios might respond to abrupt changes in public policy, and shift into greener assets. Investors should anticipate significant and potentially volatile climate transition repricing in some parts of the economy and markets, said Jane Ambachtsheer, global head of sustainability at BNP Paribas Asset Management.",09/12/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/12/09/economy/climate-change-company-valuations/index.html
The Arctic saw near-record heat again in 2019. It? an ominous sign for the future of the planet,"The Arctics snow and ice are the planets air-conditioner, reflecting the suns energy back into space and keeping temperatures around the North Pole cool. But a new report shows there are signs that this critical cooling system may be breaking down, and the impacts of what is happening in the Arctic are being felt by people and ecosystems far beyond. In 2019, average air temperatures in the Arctic were 1.9 degrees Celsius (3.42 degrees Fahrenheit) above normal, the second-hottest recorded since 1900, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations annual Arctic Report Card, published Tuesday. The high temperatures in 2019 are another sign that the current period of Arctic warming shows no signs of stopping. Since the mid-1990s, the Arctic has experienced levels of warming that are more than double the global average. And since 2014, every year in the Arctic has been warmer than any year between 1900-2014, the study found. The authors say these exceptionally high air temperatures are at the root of the other impacts chronicled in the report  from shrinking sea ice cover and shifts in fish species distributions, to near-record melting on Greenlands ice sheet and permafrost thaw. For years, climate scientists have paid close attention to the Arctic to understand the effects of human emissions of heat-trapping gases. The Arctic is a bellwether for the global climate  seemingly small changes here can have huge consequences, and portend whats to come for the rest of the planet. A couple of degrees of warming in Florida is something you may not even notice. But in the Arctic, going from 31 degrees to 33 degrees (Fahrenheit), youre going from ice-skating to swimming in the Arctic Ocean, said Walt Meier, a senior research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center and a co-lead author on the Arctic Report Cards sea ice section. One of the most significant impacts of a warmer Arctic is the effect the heat is having on the regions sea ice, which continued a pattern of decline in 2019. Warmer temperatures lead to less ice and snow, which means less sunlight is reflected and more heat is absorbed by the dark water of the open ocean. This warms the ocean further, which continues a vicious cycle that shrinks the sea ice even more. Sea ice coverage in the Arctic usually reaches its annual minimum in September after the ice melts over the summer months. This year, the remaining area of ice after the summer melt was tied with 2007 and 2016 for the second-lowest ever recorded. The 13 lowest sea ice extents in the satellite record have now all occurred in the last 13 years. Sea ice usually freezes again during the cold winter months, but the 2018-2019 winter maximum extent of sea ice coverage was also much smaller than normal, ranking as the seventh-lowest recorded, according to the report. There have been other significant changes to the thickness of the sea ice in recent years, which continued in 2019. As recently as 1985, older and thicker ice made up 33% of the sea ice at the end of winter. But the Arctics ice has thinned drastically lately. In March 2019, barely more than 1% of the sea ice was thick ice that remained frozen from the previous year. Were seeing a continued shift towards a younger, thinner, and less extensive ice cover, Meier said. The vanishing sea ice has well-documented impacts on animals like polar bears that use it as a platform from which to hunt their prey. But it is also having major impacts on other species too, including humans. The Bering Sea, which links the northern Pacific Ocean with the Arctic Ocean, provides more than 40% of the US catch of fish and shellfish, and many indigenous communities depend on its waters for food. The presence of certain kinds of fish in the Bering Sea is dependent on the formation of sea ice there, which cools the waters to make an ideal habitat for its native species. But the Bering Sea has seen record low sea ice the last two winters and the change is reshaping the entire marine ecosystem, the report says. Without sea ice to cool the water, fish and other species that prefer warmer waters are pushing into areas outside of their normal range, while cold water species are moving further north into the Arctic. According to testimony in the report from leaders of indigenous communities, these seismic changes are imperiling the food sources their people rely on. In a warming Arctic, access to our subsistence foods is shrinking and becoming more hazardous to hunt and fish, they say in the report. Greenlands ice sheet contains enough water to raise global sea levels by more than 24 feet, and the report finds that 2019 was another year of near-record melting, The ice lost in 2019 rivaled the melting seen in 2012, which set the record for melting on the ice sheet. The report finds that between 2002 and 2019, enough melt water from Greenlands ice sheet spilled into the ocean to raise global sea levels by an average of 0.7 millimeters each year. That might not sound like much, but analysis shows that 190 million people currently live below where the high tide line is expected to be in 2100, so seemingly small amounts of sea level rise can have huge impacts on coastal communities. There is some amount of sea level rise that is now baked in, said Twila Moon, another research scientist at the NSIDC and one of the authors of the Arctic Report Cards Greenland chapter. However, the actions that we are taking right now are going to make a very, very large difference in how much sea level rise there is in the future. Another study released Tuesday in the scientific journal Nature brought even more bad news for Greenland and the billions of people living along the worlds coasts. Between 2005 and 2011, Greenlands ice sheet melted at a rate that was five times faster than during the early 1990s. And all told, Greenlands melting tracks closely with the worst-case sea level rise scenarios projected by the UNs Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. At this rate, melting from Greenlands ice sheet alone could raise global sea levels by close to half a foot by 2100. The findings are just the latest in a steady stream of dire scientific reports showing the massive changes that humans are causing to the global climate, and come as world leaders gather in Madrid this week to refine their pledges to cut heat-trapping gases.",10/12/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/12/10/world/climate-change-noaa-arctic-report-card-2019/index.html
"World must reach ?eak meat?by 2030 to meet climate change targets, scientists warn","The world needs to reach peak meat within the next 10 years to combat the effects of climate change, scientists have warned. In a letter to The Lancet Planetary Health Journal, they said all but the poorest countries needed to set a time frame for livestock production to stop growing, since the meat and dairy sector is responsible for such a large proportion of emissions. The scientists called on governments to identify the largest emissions sources or land-occupiers in the livestock sector and set reduction targets to help fight the risk of global temperatures rising by more than the safe limit of 1.5-2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The reduction we need means we need deep transformation in every sector, Helen Harwatt, an environmental social scientist at Harvard Law School and lead author of the letter, told CNN. To reduce to 1.5 C, we need to remove massive amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere. Were suggesting agriculture transitions to optimal systems, and thats plant-based. The letter, signed by 50 experts in the field, said that if the livestock sector were to continue on its present trajectory, it would account for almost half of the emissions target by 2030. The scientists called for the agricultural sector to diversify food production by replacing animals with foods that have a low impact on the environment, such as pulses, grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds. The letter said that when grazing land is not required or is unsuitable for horticulture or arable production, it should, where possible, be repurposed by restoring native vegetation such as forest, which acts as a carbon sink. A carbon sink is anything that absorbs more carbon that it releases, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Stuart Roberts, vice president of the National Farmers Union of England and Wales, told CNN in a statement: To say that cutting livestock numbers everywhere is the most efficient way of reducing emissions massively overgeneralises a situation that differs significantly across the world, and can hinder the countries that are practicing sustainable farming methods and have an ambition to do more. We also recognise the value of our carbon sinks and use our extensive grasslands to graze animals, which is hugely beneficial for the soil and helps locks up carbon. Grazing cattle is the most sustainable way to use land for food production which is unsuitable for growing any other crop, he said. By using our grasslands in this way we can sequester carbon at the same time as turning inedible grass into a highly nutritious protein which our growing population can enjoy. Harwatt said there were quite a few different reasons for focusing on livestock, as the sector was a hotspot for potential change. It offers these really key opportunities to give us a better chance of meeting those goals, not only to reduce emissions but to repurpose land animal agriculture occupies, she said. Some is on deforested land, and reforesting large areas of this land will be needed to help meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. The other issue with temperature and emissions is methane. Animal agriculture is the biggest source of methane emissions. Scientists agree that CO2 emissions must not exceed 420 billion tonnes before the end of this century, and approximately 720 billion tonnes of CO2 must be removed from the atmosphere to limit global warming to 1.5 degree Celsius. Reestablishing vegetation is viewed as the best large-scale option for removing CO2 from the atmosphere and preventing atmospheric warming, which could result in the loss of coral reefs, ice sheets and life-supporting ecosystems. The letter said the process of returning areas of farmland to their natural state must begin immediately to be effective within the required timescale of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. They warned that high- and middle-income countries should not outsource livestock production to other countries but instead reduce demand for livestock products in order to meet the terms of the Paris climate change agreement. Since the first Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment report in 1990, the production of meat, milk, and eggs increased from 758 million tonnes to 1.247 billion tonnes in 2017, the scientists said, citing FAO data, and it is projected to increase further. Even if everything was done, it doesnt mean other sectors dont need to change, added Harwatt. Every industry needs to change deeply and rapidly. Were beyond the point of it being a niche agenda.",12/12/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/12/12/world/peak-meat-2030-lancet-intl-scli-scn/index.html
COP25 was meant to tackle the climate crisis. It fell short,"The message from climate activists was passionate, the warning from the scientific community and countries already experiencing the effects of climate change, urgent. The action from world powers has been excruciatingly slow and inadequate. What had been scheduled as a 12-day summit aimed at hammering out the rules of the 2015 Paris Climate accord, instead dragged on two extra days and highlighted the huge disconnect between the worlds biggest polluting nations, and the global community demanding change. Negotiators in Madrid worked through the night to salvage a rulebook for cutting greenhouse gas emissions before 2020, when signatories must start meeting those targets. Yet even after extending overtime, many observers, scientists and climate activists called the resulting agreement a monumental failure, strewn with watered-down language that kicks urgent items down the road to COP26 in 2020. Host country Spain said Sundays agreement expresses the urgent need for new carbon-cutting commitments. Critics said the text falls short on decisive language for doing so. As time ran out, the COP looked more and more like a hostage situation inside a burning building  together with most negotiators, people and planet were held captive, said May Boeve, Executive Director of climate campaign group 350.org, in a statement. She added that, after forcing negotiators to keep at it for three days straight, the worlds biggest carbon emitters and fossil fuel industry got what they wanted  a weakened text that kicks most of the big issues down the road to COP26. Helen Mountford, vice president for climate and economics at global research organization the World Resources Institute agreed. There is no sugarcoating it, she said. The negotiations fell far short of what was expected. Instead of leading the charge for more ambition, most of the large emitters were missing in action or obstructive. The can-do spirit that birthed the Paris Agreement feels like a distant memory today. There was some glimmer of hope. Eighty governments  mostly developing and island nations most vulnerable to the effects of climate change  have committed to bringing enhanced climate plans to COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, representing over 10% of global emissions, according to environmental communications experts, Climate Nexus. It added that the United States showed many different faces at the summit. While negotiators blocked progress on some issues, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also led a 15-member Congressional delegation to assure the world that we are still in. The summit featured almost 200 countries wrangling over the rules of the 2015 Paris climate accord. Its political foot-dragging was in stark contrast to impassioned pleas coming from campaigners. On the verge of tears, Ugandan climate activist, Hilda Flavia Nakabuye, told CNN: When you talk to people who are causing this [climate change] and they are not listening, it feels like you are wasting time. She was 10 years old when torrential rains stripped her familys crops and drought forced them to sell their land and livelihood. I am the voice of dying children, displaced women, and people suffering at the hands of the climate crisis created by rich countries, Nakabuye told conference members, willing delegates to recognize the scale of the environmental emergency. Voices from the global south deserve to be heard... we are humans who do not deserve to suffer a crisis that we did not create. Negotiators struggled to find common ground at the summit, especially over rules for a new global carbon trading market. Its a major part of the Paris agreement, designed to reduce emissions of planet-warming gases, and has yet to be finalized. The US, Saudi Arabia, Russia, China, India and other big polluters are accused of obstructionist behavior while Australia and Brazil stand accused of seeking loopholes to recycle old carbon credits in order to meet their commitments under the Paris accord. Brazil is being difficult because what they want their past emission reductions to be carried forward to the new regime, Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics, told CNN. Critics say this route, which is similar to using expired banknotes in a modern market, means greenhouse gases wont be lowered at the rate needed to keep global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. And the United States, the historys largest emitter of greenhouse gases, is leaving the process next year. Members of the We Are Still In coalition, which was at the conference, are trying to fill the gap. The group consists of US states and cities, businesses, tribes and academic institutions, that came together soon after the Trump administration said it wanted to leave the Paris accord. Even though our federal government decided to leave the Paris agreement, governments, institutions, corporations around the US are fully still in and we are working together and with our partners around the world to make sure that those agreements are met, Bill Peduto, the Democratic Mayor of Pittsburgh, told CNN in Madrid. The American coalition says it represents an economy worth $6.2 trillion  equivalent to the third biggest country in the world. According to its report, it will be able to reduce US total emissions by 37% below the 2005 levels by 2030. But for the US to be able to bring emissions in line with the necessary goal, the federal government needs to come on board. Its going to be very difficult to reach a goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius without the US (federal government) playing the leadership role we need it to play, Andrew Steer, President and CEO of the Washington-based climate policy think tank, World Resources Institute, told CNN. The burning of fossil fuels is the main driver of climate change, and activists blame the oil, coal and gas industry of slowing governments down on emissions targets. Meanwhile there are mounting public concerns about climate change, a slew of scientific reports warning of climate catastrophe and fury from a youth-led protest movement, which saw an estimated 4 million people join a global climate strike in September. Teen activist Greta Thunberg who began the youth-led movement of kids striking for the climate, excoriated delegates for their inaction on Wednesday. We have been striking for over a year, and basically nothing has happened, Thunberg told the crowd. The climate crisis is still being ignored by those in power, and we cannot go on like this. There were some signs of hope at the event. On Monday, finance ministers from more than 50 countries unveiled an action plan that would see them incorporate climate solutions into their policies, which Ward described as a game-changing moment. If we are going to really change to a zero carbon economy, it needs a massive investment and that investment will be made by finance ministries, he said. Yet campaigners are urgently calling for more dramatic change after decades of debate. We all talk about climate emergency but dont act as if there is any, Ugandan campaigner Nakabuye implored the summit. Dear leaders, we need leadership on climate action not talks. For how long will you keep negotiating? You have been negotiating for the last 25 years, even before I was born.",15/12/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/12/15/world/cop25-climate-change-intl/index.html
"London has spent billions, but no one can escape climate change","The stark reality of climate change is that even the cities that seem best defended against rising sea levels face the potential of catastrophic flooding. Take London, capital of the UK. Its in a strong position: Wealthy, with a government that recognizes the danger of climate change, and a river that can  for now  be shut off from dangerous tidal and storm surges. And yet, no city or person is immune from climate change. At least 1 million Londoners live in the estuarys natural floodplain and 16% of the citys properties  84,000  are considered to be at significant or moderate risk. Humans have already put so much greenhouse gas into the earths atmosphere that some amount of sea level rise is inevitable. Even if we reduce our emissions to negative now, we will see at least a meter of sea level rise, the oceanographer Ivan Haigh told CNN. Clearly, quitting all emissions immediately is off the table. So how soon will we have a meter of sea level rise? And how much higher will it go? Thats a question that Haigh, associate professor at the UKs University of Southampton, has devoted much of his career to studying. CNN caught up with him in November on a rainy day along the Thames, a short walk from the Houses of Parliament. High tide was approaching. I have to admit, I come up to London quite a lot, and this is one of the highest Ive seen it (the river), Haigh said. Its easy to go through your day in this city and not notice the river. But it just took crossing a short sea wall that runs along the promenade for the water to rush over our feet. Londoners have long been aware of the threat from the water that brought them so much wealth as the city grew around the Thames. After years of deliberation, a giant flood defense system was built across the river, completed in 1982. Spanning 520 meters (1,706ft) across the Thames, the barrier uses 10 enormous steel gates to shut the city off from tidal surge. Each gate, which rotates into position, stands more than five stories high. It can be used to protect against both tidal flooding and that from raining, fluvial, which bloats the river. The UK Environment Agency, which operates the barrier, says that as climate change necessitates more closures, its use will need to be conserved for tidal flood risk management  the purpose for which it was designed. With only 30 years of barrier usage, anomalous years drown out clear trends. In 2013-14, it was closed 50 times, mostly for river flooding  far more than any other year before or since. Sea level rise is a relatively slow process, Haigh said. But its starting to accelerate. So although we dont see a trend now, with sea levels accelerating after 2050, or even before, that trend should become apparent. The last week of November in which we met Haigh saw an unusually high tide. Those who run the barrier said it was a close call whether to close it that day. The tide got to about 40 centimeters (16 inches) away from the trigger point  a complex calculation depending on the type and location of high water. The barrier, Haigh said, gives an artificial sense of protection. A lot of people living in the flood plains dont realize theyre living in the flood plains. Jonathan Bamber, professor of physical geography at the University of Bristol, crunched the numbers. Using his own research, Bamber provided CNN with projections for sea level rise in the Thames Estuary every decade until 2300. If we keep increasing emissions into the future  the business as usual scenario  temperatures are almost certain to rise more than two degrees over pre-industrial level. That is the maximum target set out by the Paris Climate Accords, to avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate change. That means we will likely see a meter of sea level rise by 2100, from a combination of warmer water, which expands, and melting ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica. Related: COP25 was meant to tackle the climate crisis. It fell short The Thames Barrier is only expected to last until 2070. The crunch point actually is not so much the height of sea level rise, its how many times you have to close the barrier, Haigh said. If we get to a point where were closing too much, then the costs dont stack up and we will need a new system. The math is simple: The more the Thames Barrier is used, the faster it will age, and the greater the need for a replacement. The UK Environment Agency has developed a detailed plan to deal with the reality that Londons collective flood defenses will require replacement or major repair at a cost of several billion pounds. Already, the agency anticipates spending 300 million ($395 million) between 2010 and 2034 on protecting Londons floodplain. Among the front-runners for the long term, when the Thames Barrier is no longer usable, is the construction of an entirely new barrier, much further downstream towards the sea, near the town of Dartford in Kent. But that one meter of sea rise is a best-case scenario. Bambers numbers predict that by 2300, the sea level in the Thames Estuary is likely to reach more than three meters  and could go even higher, if emissions and temperatures continue to rise unabated. We have several billion pounds of coastal defense infrastructure, Haigh said. Other places in the world are not going to be as prepared. Just how bad will it be? Thats very much dependent on whether we follow the Paris Agreement or not, he added.",16/12/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/12/16/world/london-sea-level-climate-change-intl-gbr/index.html
"In Asia Pacific the climate crisis is happening now, not in the future","The worlds most disaster-prone region felt the harsh reality of the climate crisis in 2019. Toxic smog shrouded Asian megacities, hundreds died in flooding and landslides, cyclones battered coastlines and bushfires, droughts and deadly heatwaves led to towns and cities almost running out of water. Far from being anomalies, scientists say the climate crisis is causing more extreme weather events  and its having devastating consequences in Asia and the Pacific. The relentless sequence of natural disasters over the past two years was beyond what the region had previously experienced or was able to predict, said a United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) report in August. This is a sign of things to come in the new climate reality. Rallying calls for climate action have been made in countless forums, summits and pledges this year. But while many people in developed countries see the climate crisis as an urgent but future problem, for millions living in Asia-Pacific, its already touching every part of life. Those on the front lines say words must now translate into tangible change as the world heads into a new decade. The Asia-Pacific region, home to 60% of the worlds population, is one of the most vulnerable areas to the climate crisis. Compounding the problem is rapid urbanization in many Asian nations, with the pace of development often overtaking proper infrastructure planning. Population booms and the mass migration of people to cities for work is putting strain on water and food supplies. Many big Asian cities, including Mumbai, Shanghai, Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh City, and Jakarta, are coastal and low-lying, making them susceptible to sea level rise and other extreme weather events. Fast-growing, industrializing and coal-reliant Asian countries are pumping out increasing levels of carbon dioxide emissions, despite efforts by nations such as India and China to move towards cleaner energy. As material wealth grows, so too does the consumer market and demand for emissions-producing conveniences such as air-conditioning, cars and disposable goods. While wealthier cities like Hong Kong can afford to disaster-proof  to an extent. At the other end of the scale, poverty-stricken populations are living in some of the most environmentally precarious places on Earth, where extreme weather events could prove disastrous for lives, food production, water sources, economies and infrastructure. If we do not take urgent climate action now, then we are heading for a temperature increase of more than 3C by the end of the century, with ever more harmful impacts on human wellbeing, said World Meteorological Organization Secretary-General Petteri Taalas, in a statement. We are nowhere near on track to meet the Paris Agreement target. As a resident of the low-lying Pacific Island of Samoa, Tagaloa Cooper-Halo has experienced climate changes first hand. Sea level rise is speeding up, said Cooper-Halo, who is Director of Climate Change Resilience at the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP). We expected sea level rise in about 20 years to be showing the changes. But we are seeing it already now. In a landmark report this year, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) confirmed that global sea levels are rising faster than expected. Increasing greenhouse gas emissions, warming temperatures, melting glaciers and disappearing ice sheets could cause sea levels to rise more than two meters (6.6 feet) by the end of this century if emissions continue unchecked, a study released in May found. A rise of two meters would displace 187 million people, mostly from Asia, and swamp major cities such as Shanghai. Another study suggested that in Southeast Asia, parts of southern Vietnam and Bangkok could be underwater by 2050. Adapting to rising sea levels will be a key challenge for Asia-Pacific, according to the UN Development Program. Measures include defending coastlines and infrastructure, restoring mangroves, and identifying areas at risk from flooding. Cooper-Halo said Pacific nations have already been forced to adapt, installing monitoring stations that measure sea level rise and growing crops more resilient to saltwater. Diets have already changed as ocean acidification and coral bleaching have reduced fish stocks, she said. When resources are not as plentiful as they used to be, it changes your dependency, you become more dependent on processed food and therefore we have to import a lot of processed food so it changes the way that we eat, and it therefore affects our health, Cooper-Halo said. About 2.4 billion people  about half the population of Asia  live in areas vulnerable to extreme weather events. This year, flooding and landslides, triggered by torrential monsoon rains, swept across India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, leaving devastation in each country and hundreds of deaths. China, Vietnam, Japan, India, Bangladesh, South Korea, Thailand, Sri Lanka and the Philippines, were all hit by tropical storms and typhoons  or cyclones  in 2019, causing dozens of deaths, hundreds of thousands displaced and millions of dollars in damage. The climate crisis is expected to create higher storm surges, increased rainfall and stronger winds. Joanna Sustento has been campaigning for climate action since Typhoon Haiyan devastated her home in Tacloban, the Philippines, in 2013. Sustento lost both her parents, her eldest brother, sister-in-law, and her young nephew in the storm  one of the most powerful ever recorded. We experience an average of 20 typhoons per year and they are becoming more frequent and intense. What does that mean for the Filipino community? It means damaged homes and livelihood, losing loved ones, losing access to clean food and water, being deprived of your own safety, she told CNN. Whenever an extreme weather event happens, we lose our basic human right to safe, decent, and dignified life. Seven out of 10 disasters that caused the biggest economic losses in the world from 1970 to 2019 are tropical cyclones, according to the World Meteorological Organization. The high economic cost of typhoons can cripple poor countries. In 2015, Category 5 Cyclone Pam cost the Pacific Island of Vanuatu the equivalent of 64% of its gross domestic product. All cities vulnerable to typhoons are under pressure to improve infrastructure and properly plan for future growth. Investing in early warning systems has already saved countless lives. Preparing for more extreme weather costs money and there are calls for rich nations to provide smaller economies with finance and technology to recover from the impacts of the climate crisis. Sustento said fossil fuel companies also need to do their part  by speeding up the shift to renewable energy. We should not allow the fossil fuel industry to continue with business as usual, while we are left with no choice but to live with the new normal, to count our dead, to search for the missing, and to fear for our future, she said. As the climate crisis makes rainfall and the annual monsoons  vital for the regions agriculture  more erratic, droughts and water shortages will become more severe. The past five years have been the hottest on record and blistering heatwaves  felt this year in Japan, China, India, Pakistan, and Australia  are becoming so intense that a group of MIT researchers suggested some places could become too hot to be inhabitable. This year, Indias sixth largest city Chennai almost ran out of water. Four reservoirs that supply the citys almost 5 million residents ran almost completely dry. People queued to fill up cans of water across the city and hospitals had no water for operations or sterilizing equipment. Across the country, 600 million people are facing acute water shortage  and the crisis is expected to worsen as the Himalayan glaciers melt and Indias bore wells threaten to run dry. We have an economy where theres a population thats growing and industry thats growing. So you need 40% more water for industry, you need more water for more people. You need more water for everything, said Jyoti Sharma, founder and president of FORCE, an Indian NGO. A new report this month said a quarter of the worlds population is living in regions where water resources are insufficient for the needs of the people  with once unthinkable water crises becoming common. Water stress is the biggest crisis no one is talking about. Its consequences are in plain sight in the form of food insecurity, conflict and migration, and financial instability, said Andrew Steer, president and CEO of the World Resources Institute. In India, proper urban planning and development will be the way forward, according to Sharma. Make water systems more efficient, make taps and faucets, irrigation systems more efficient. I think thats what will save us from the crisis ahead, she said. The world is now 1.1 degrees warmer than it was at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution and under current scenarios, carbon dioxide emissions will need to fall by 7.6% every year in the next decade. Yet emissions are still going up. The UN Climate Change Conference earlier this month highlighted the huge disconnect between the worlds biggest polluting nations, and the global community demanding change. Many observers, scientists and climate activists called the resulting agreement a failure. Those impacted by the crisis in Asia dont have another decade for the rest of the world to get this right. Surrender is not an option, said Cooper-Halo. In the Pacific, the public has woken up to this reality for many years now, she said. Now, countries need to catch up and step up.",24/12/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/12/23/asia/asia-pacific-climate-crisis-intl-hnk/index.html
Shouting into the apocalypse: The decade in climate change,"Whats that worn-out phrase? Shouting into the wind? Well, after a decade of rising pollution, failed politics and worsening disasters, it seems the many, many of us who care about the climate crisis increasingly are shouting into the hurricane, if not the apocalypse. On the cusp of 2020, the state of the planet is far more dire than in 2010. Preserving a safe and healthy ecological system is no longer a realistic possibility. Now, were looking at less bad options, ceding the fact that the virtual end of coral reefs, the drowning of some island nations, the worsening of already-devastating storms and the displacement of millions  they seem close to inevitable. The climate crisis is already costly, deadly and deeply unjust, putting the most vulnerable people in the world, often whove done the least to cause this, at terrible risk. The worst part? Weve known about this for a very long time. The climate emergency may seem like the issue of the moment, a new thing, a 2020 Democrats thing or a Greta Thunberg thing, but check out this 1958 educational film that mentions tourists in glass-bottomed boats would be viewing the drowned towers of Miami; or coverage of the first Earth Day in 1970, 50 years ago this coming April, when millions hit the streets; or NASA scientist James Hansens 1988 testimony before the US Senate stating the era of global warming had begun. It bears repeating that scientists have looked at the evidence, and more than 97% of them agree that humans are warming the planet, primarily by burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas. The warnings from scientists are only getting more dire as we peel decades off the calendar. The point of no return is no longer over the horizon, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said earlier this month. It is in sight and is hurtling towards us. Theres a bright spot in all of this, and I will get to that. But first I think we must take a clear-eyed, cold assessment of 2020. There are two numbers you need to understand to put this moment in perspective. The first is 1.5. The Paris Agreement  the international treaty on climate change, which admittedly is in trouble, but also is the best thing weve got  sets the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 or, at most, below 2 degrees Celsius of warming. Emissions have to crash for temperatures to stop rising there. Already, humans have warmed Earth about 1 degree Celsius. The second is zero. The world needs to get to zero net emissions of greenhouse gases  meaning no net pollution from burning fossil fuels and the like  as soon as possible, but by 2050 at the latest, and we need to be about hallway there in 10 years. Emissions should be falling, fast, if the world wants to have an inkling of a chance of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees. Whats actually happening? Yep, emissions continue to rise. Worldwide fossil fuel emissions are expected to be up 0.6% in 2019 over 2018, according to projections from the Global Carbon Project. In the past decade, humans have put more than 350 metric gigatons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels and other industrial processes, according to calculations provided by the World Resources Institute. A more striking way to think about this is to look even further back in time. More than half of all industrial greenhouse gas pollution since the Industrial Revolution has been created in the past 30-some years. And, again, weve known about the crisis, along with its causes and solutions, for longer than that. We basically dillied and dallied and squandered the last 40 years, and you cant just keep kicking the can down the road, Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, and a senior research scientist, told me. To hold to 1.5 degrees (Celsius), which frankly is not going to happen, would require at best reducing global emissions 7.5% every year, starting next year, at a time when emissions are actually going up! The longer we wait the more impossible it becomes. Meanwhile, scientists are becoming even more concerned about tipping points in the climate system that could lead to rapid rise in sea levels, the deterioration of the Amazon and so on. One particularly frightening commentary last month in the journal Nature, by several notable climate scientists, says the odds we can avoid tipping points in the climate system could already have shrunk towards zero. In non-science-speak: Were there now. The world is in a far more perilous place at the end of 2019 compared to 2010 as climate impacts are being seen and felt all over the world, Bill Hare, director of Climate Analytics, a research group, said in an email. We have used up nearly half the carbon budget we had remaining in 2010. Fossil fuel emissions are 10% higher, and still increasing. Sea level rise is accelerating, and global temperature is increasing at 0.2 degrees Celsius per decade. Its not as if no one cares. This was the decade when some people finally started to see the climate crisis as personal. Climate attribution science, which looks for human fingerprints on extreme weather events, made its way into the popular imagination. Were starting to realize there are no truly natural disasters anymore. Weve warmed the climate, and were already making storms riskier. I spent a good chunk of this decade in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria and in other locations where the climate crisis is obviously present tense. Alaska, Honduras, Florida, Oklahoma, Madagascar, the Marshall Islands, Costa Rica. In these places, especially in the aftermath of a flood, fire or drought, the climate threat feels urgent, even deadly. Shockingly so. The news media is picking that up, using terms such as climate emergency and climate crisis instead of the blander climate change. Increasingly, lots of people are making these critical connections, which should motivate the political, social and economic revolution necessary to fix things. Yes, the Paris Agreement happened in 2015. But the end of the fossil fuel era is not yet in sight. Theres evidence that only certain chunks of society are getting the message. Only 52% of American adults say they are very or extremely sure global warming is happening, according to a report from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and the George Mason University Center for Climate Change Communication, which is based on a 1,303 person survey conducted in November 2019. Yales been asking that question for a while now. Go back a decade, to 2009, and the rate is about the same: 51%. In other words: Despite the increased sense of urgency, public opinion is flat. On the political left, however, people view the issue quite differently than they did a decade ago, according to Leiserowitz, the director of the Yale program. Liberal Democrats view global warming as their No. 3 voting issue, with environmental protection as No. 2, he said. Compare that to conservative Republicans, who rank global warming dead last on a 29-issue list. OK, so about that hope. The bright spot  and it truly is a bright one  is that young people are waking up. They are shouting, loudly and with purpose. Witness Greta Thunberg, the dynamic teenager who started a one-girl protest outside the Swedish Parliament last year, demanding that adults take seriously this emergency, which threatens young people and future generations disproportionately. Greta, in the space of basically 14 months, goes from being a lonely teenage girl sitting with a little sign outside the Parliament building, all by herself, to on one day having 4 million people marching in the streets with her all around the world, Leiserowitz said. Thats remarkable! We should continue shouting Gretas Yes, and message into the next decade. Yes, this truly is a horrible mess. And yes, we must fix it.",26/12/2019,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/12/26/opinions/climate-change-decade-in-review-sutter/index.html
"Fires, storms and floods cost $150 billion in 2019. More disasters are on the way","Hurricanes, wildfires and floods cost the world $150 billion in 2019 and losses for business and the economy are only expected to increase, because of a decade-long rise in natural catastrophes with direct links to climate change. Munich Re, one of the worlds largest reinsurance companies, said Wednesday that it expects to see an increase in the frequency and intensity of weather-related disasters in certain parts of the world. Reinsurance companies sell cover to insurers to protect them from very large losses. We expect 2020 to be part of this trend towards increasing losses from weather-related disasters, a trend that we have been observing over the last decade, Ernst Rauch, Munich Res chief climatologist, told CNN Business. Climate change is contributing to the increase in extreme weather events, said Rauch. Munich Re, which has been studying climate change since the 1970s, has observed an increase in severe thunderstorms in North America and Europe. The storms are at times accompanied by hail, tornadoes and flooding, and their frequency can most likely only be explained by climate change, Rauch added. In Australia, a prolonged period of extremely dry and unusually hot weather has added to the severity of bushfires in the country and can likely be attributed to global warming, he said. What climate change does is change probabilities, so if we see an increasing probability of large losses from wildfires that indicates that climate change is contributing, added Rauch. Losses from Australian wildfires have increased over the past four decades, Rauch said. The Insurance Council of Australia said in a statement Tuesday that insurance losses from bush fires this season stood at $700 million Australian dollars ($481 million). Insurers have received nearly 9,000 claims since September and many more are expected to be lodged in coming days and weeks, the Insurance Council said. At least 26 people have died in the fires, according to Australian police. There were 820 natural catastrophes in 2019, slightly below the previous year but well above the long-term average of 520, according to Munich Re. In 2018, losses from natural disasters amounted to $186 billion. Japans typhoons Hagibis and Faxai together accounted for the largest overall losses ($26 billion) last year, followed by Typhoon Lekima, and floods in India and China. Natural disasters cost the insurance industry $52 billion in 2019, below the previous year but above the 30-year average. This is partly due to lower cover for flood losses in developed countries, Rauch said. Disasters such as Mozambiques Cyclone Idai  which caused $2.3 billion in losses and more than 1,000 deaths  were almost completely uninsured, he said. More people are taking out cover for natural catastrophes in rich countries, but insurance penetration has barely increased in the developing world, Rauch said. An increase in losses from weather-related disasters will cause premiums to rise and make it more expensive for business and property owners to buy insurance, he said.",08/01/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/08/business/munich-re-climate-change-natural-disasters/index.html
Australia is burning. The Arctic is melting. Yet Trump keeps gutting climate change regulations.,"Editors Note: A version of this story first published in September 2019. The story has been updated with additional administration actions. An impeachment trial looms and a major Middle East crisis is unfolding with Iran. Still, the Trump administration has remained steadfast in pursuit of one of its signature policy goals: the gutting of environmental regulations, which include those aimed at curbing climate change. From changes in early January to curb key parts of a landmark environmental protection law to relaxing restrictions on power plant emissions, Trump has attempted to remove many of the guardrails installed by the Obama and previous administrations that can limit the scope of global warming. The world is already feeling the dangerous impacts of climate change, and has been for some time. Earth just endured its second hottest year on record. The typically frozen Arctic is melting at an alarming rate. And Australia is battling hellish wildfires, made even worse by global warming. For years now, the worlds top climate scientists have warned that waiting any longer to drastically cut global emissions of planet-warming gases risks exposing millions more to the worst consequences of the climate crisis  more frequent droughts, wildfires and even food shortages. He is locking in permanent, irreversible damage to our environment through his irresponsible environmental policies, including his efforts to block progress on climate change, said Dr. Michael E. Mann, distinguished professor of atmospheric science at Penn State University and the director of the Penn State Earth System Science Center, said of Trump policies. Once we go beyond key tipping points  the melting of the major ice sheets  there is no going back. Heres a look at some of the most consequential climate policy rollbacks: On January 9, the Trump administration announced plans to rewrite decades-old regulations in order to make it easier to build major infrastructure projects without considering the potential impacts to greenhouse gas emissions or of climate change, including sea level rise. The changes announced to how the 50-year-old National Environmental Policy Act is enforced would apply to projects like pipelines, highways and mines, which had been required to undergo in-depth environmental impact assessments. According to The New York Times, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt called the changes the administrations most impactful deregulatory move yet. The proposed changes have outraged many environmental groups, and are all but guaranteed to face legal challenges. In 2018, the Times reported that the Trump administration was seeking to relax fuel efficiency and auto emissions benchmarks, a shift that would stamp out one of former President Barack Obamas signature climate initiatives. If the proposed change goes into effect, it could have profound consequences for the planet: Transportation emits more greenhouse gases than any other sector of the US economy, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. But California and several other states have sued to block the change, and there are signs that even some automakers are not on board with Trumps rollbacks. Last year, Trump also announced he was revoking Californias authority to set its own vehicle emissions standards, a move that the states attorney general has vowed to challenge in court. In a boost to electrical utilities and the struggling coal industry, Trumps move to replace Obamas Clean Power Plan could have serious consequences for the health of humans and the planet. The Clean Power Plan placed flexible limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and, according to analysis by Obamas EPA, would have reduced CO2 emissions from power generators by 32% compared with 2005 levels by 2030. Trumps replacement for the Clean Power Plan is called the Affordable Clean Energy rule and allows states to set their own emissions standards for coal-fueled power plants. Last year, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler touted the plan, saying it gives power companies the regulatory certainty they need to continue to reduce emissions and provide affordable and reliable energy for all Americans. But the new rule could cost American lives. By EPAs own analysis, Trumps rule could result in 1,400 more premature deaths by 2030 than under the Clean Power Plan. Many states and cities are also suing to block the new regulations from going into effect. Many scientists warn that keeping fossil fuels in the ground is critical to tackling the climate crisis. But the Trump administration has moved the US in the opposite direction, opening vast stretches of land and water offshore to oil and gas drilling. In 2017, the administration shrank two of Utahs national monuments  Grand-Staircase Escalante National Monument and Bears Ears  by 51% and 85%, respectively. The moves took land areas spanning twice the size of Rhode Island out of protected status and were part of the largest reduction of public lands in US history, according to a study published in the journal Science. The changes open the areas removed from the national monuments to oil and gas development, but both decisions face challenges in court. The administration has also pushed to open Alaskas Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas exploration, as well as waters offshore along the East and Pacific coasts, and the Arctic. The pipeline projects potentially lock in long-term extraction of natural gas and petroleum, and therefore have a very long legacy that will extend beyond the next administration, Mann said. Trumps move to begin formally pulling the US out of the landmark Paris climate accord, which was agreed to by nearly all of the worlds countries, was a major blow to the global response to the climate crisis. The decision sent a message to the rest of the world that the US  which cant officially leave the agreement until the day after this years presidential election  would not be leading the global fight against climate change. And studies have shown the decision has had global implications: A report last year found that Trumps decision has made it easier for other countries to renege on their climate commitments. Last year, Trumps EPA announced that it would no longer require oil and gas companies to install monitors that detect methane leaks from new wells, tanks and pipelines. At a time when the US has become the worlds biggest natural gas and oil producer, the move is significant because of the potency of methanes heat-trapping capabilities. Though the gas doesnt last in the atmosphere as long as CO2, 1 ton of methane has 84 to 87 times more global warming potential than the same amount of CO2 over a 20-year period. Another key global agreement to limit planet-warming gases went into effect last year, but Trump has yet to send it to the Senate to ratify it. The treaty is called the Kigali Amendment, and it deals with a little-known but highly potent class of greenhouse gases called hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which are used in refrigerators and air conditioners. The gases are sometimes called super greenhouse gases because of their capacity to trap huge amounts of heat in the atmosphere; they have more than 1,000 times greater warming potential than carbon dioxide. The climate change solutions organization Project Drawdown has found that phasing out these chemicals would be the most impactful solution to stop global warming  more than eating less meat, driving electric cars or switching to renewable energy.",11/01/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/10/politics/trump-climate-change-environmental-policy-rollbacks/index.html
Oceans are warming at the same rate as if five Hiroshima bombs were dropped in every second,"The worlds oceans are now heating at the same rate as if five Hiroshima atomic bombs were dropped into the water every second, scientists have said. A new study released on Monday showed that 2019 was yet another year of record-setting ocean warming, with water temperatures reaching the highest temperature ever recorded. An international team of 14 scientists examined data going back to the 1950s, looking at temperatures from the ocean surface to 2,000 meters deep. The study, which was published in the journal Advances in Atmospheric Sciences, also showed that the oceans are warming at an increasing speed. While the past decade has been the warmest on record for global ocean temperatures, the hottest five years ever recorded all came in the last five. The upward trend is relentless, and so we can say with confidence that most of the warming is man-made climate change, said Kevin Trenberth, distinguished senior scientist in the Climate Analysis Section at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. The study shows that while the oceans warmed steadily between 1955 and 1986, warming has accelerated rapidly in the last few decades. Between 1987-2019, ocean warming was 450% greater than during the earlier time period. Lijing Cheng, the papers lead author and an associate professor at the International Center for Climate and Environmental Sciences at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said the ocean temperature was 0.075 degrees Celsius above the 1981-2010 average in 2019. There are no reasonable alternatives aside from the human emissions of heat trapping gases to explain this heating, Cheng said, adding that to reach this temperature, the ocean would have taken in 228,000,000,000,000,000,000,000  or 228 sextillion  joules of heat. The Hiroshima atom-bomb exploded with an energy of about 63,000,000,000,000 Joules, Cheng said. I did a calculation ... the amount of heat we have put in the worlds oceans in the past 25 years equals to 3.6 billion Hiroshima atom-bomb explosions, he added. Thats equivalent to dropping roughly four Hiroshima bombs into the oceans every second over the past quarter of a century. But because the warming is speeding up, the rate at which we are dropping these imaginary bombs is getting faster than ever. We are now at five to six Hiroshima bombs of heat each second, said John Abraham, one of the authors of the study and a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota. Oceans serve as a good indicator of the real impact of climate change. Covering almost three quarters of Earths surface, they absorb the vast majority of the worlds heat. Since 1970, more than 90% of the planets excess heat went into the oceans, while less than 4% was absorbed by the atmosphere and the land, the study said. But just because people live on land doesnt mean they are immune from the effects of the warming waters. Ocean warming has a profound impact on the entire world. If you want to understand global warming, you have to measure ocean warming, Abraham said. For instance, both Hurricane Harvey, which killed at least 68 people in 2017, and Hurricane Florence, whose torrential rains flooded large parts of the US East Coast, were influenced by abnormally high temperatures. While scientists say man-made climate change isnt solely to blame for tropical storms, studies have shown that higher temperatures can make them wetter and more damaging. Rising temperatures also mean ocean waters have less oxygen and are becoming more acidic, which has a major impact on nutrients that feed marine wildlife. For example, when an ocean heat wave struck the waters of Western Australia in 2011, scientists noticed there were fewer dolphin births and the animals survival rate dropped. The warming is also changing currents and altering weather systems at a speed wildlife cannot keep up with. It is critical to understand how fast things are changing, Abraham added. The scientists said that while the damage done to the oceans is in many ways irreversible, there is hope for the future. We will see continuous increase in ocean heat content in this century even if we can keep the global mean surface temperature (rise) well below 2 degrees Celsius (the goal of the Paris Agreement), Cheng said. However, he added that the speed of warming is entirely dependent on the worlds actions on climate change. If we can reduce emissions, we can reduce the warming level, and then reduce the associated risks and loses, he said. Trenberth added that an increasing price on carbon would help limit the warming. If the leaders of the world changed course, a revolution could take place over about 15 years ... this requires the leaders of China, and the US in particular, along with Europe, to take a strong leadership role and set the stage for the rest of the world to follow, he said.",13/01/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/13/world/climate-change-oceans-heat-intl/index.html
"More Americans are alarmed by global warming than ever before, survey reveals","The proportion of Americans who are alarmed by global warming tripled over the last five years and is now at an all-time high, a new survey shows. Almost 6 in 10 Americans are either alarmed or concerned by global warming, marking what researchers say is a major shift in public perception of the issue. The survey was conducted by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and George Mason Universitys Center for Climate Change Communication, which together have tracked Americans views on climate change since 2008. As recently as 2014, the percentage of Americans categorized as dismissive of global warming was roughly the same as those who were alarmed  around 11 to 12%. But in the years since, the ranks of the dismissive  those who believe global warming is not happening or caused by humans  has fallen to just 10%. Over the same time, the alarmed group  people who are most worried about global warming and support measures to reduce heat-trapping carbon pollution  grew to 31% of those surveyed, and today outnumber the dismissive crowd by more than 3-to-1. The findings show that as the global climate changes rapidly, a growing proportion of Americans view the climate crisis as an actual crisis. This new urgency felt by many Americans stands in sharp contrast to the policies of the Trump administration, which has rolled back dozens of environmental regulations, many of which were aimed at curbing climate change. Indeed, the shift in public opinion hasnt yet been translated into meaningful policy at the federal level, says Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication who co-led the survey. The overall trend is a major shift in the political climate of climate change in this country, but in terms of (the alarmed) exerting its full political force, it is yet to do so because it is still relatively unorganized, he said. As for what could be behind the shift, Leiserowitz says there are a number of likely factors. One, he says, is the science. The reports from the scientific community have become ever more dire, he said, pointing to the alarming United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2018 report that showed the window to stem catastrophic climate change is rapidly closing as one example. Another reason is that political leaders are talking about the issue more, and polls have shown that tackling climate change is now a top issue for many Democratic voters. The impact of increased news media coverage also cant be ignored, Leisorowitz says. The media as a whole, when it doesnt talk about the issue, the issue fades from public awareness and concern, he said. Then, there are the increasing number of extreme weather disasters that have directly impacted many Americans. Climate change has made many of these events more likely and more destructive. Reporters and public figures are helping people to connect the dots, Leiserowitz says. These horrific, catastrophic disasters that Americans are experiencing right now need to be interpreted for people to really understand, he said. And what were seeing is that when many Americans see these things in their backyards or on their television screens, theyre starting to ask, What the hell is going on with the weather?",17/01/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/17/us/survey-shows-more-americans-alarmed-by-global-warming/index.html
Fires and floods prove world leaders must act now on climate change,"There is an increasingly dangerous disconnect between the urgency of our climate emergency and our failure to do anything about it. Its not as if we dont understand the severity of the problem. The global elite believe that the top five risks facing the world today are all environmental, according to the World Economic Forums Global Risks Report. Allow us to correct this perilous mislabeling: The threats do not come just from the environment, but from human inaction. This is not only a failure of language, but also a failure of leadership. As Antonio Guterres, the UN Secretary-General, warned at the start of the Madrid climate talks in December, we are fiddling while the planet burns. Every global summit that shirks decisive climate action chips away at the publics trust in our ability to face up to the challenge. Yet Davos  where government, civil society and business leaders mingle  has an unprecedented opportunity to accelerate the urgent need for collective action. Our leaders should start by showing what a future without fossil fuels will look like; that it is not only desirable, but also a realistic and superior alternative to what we have now. And for communities that are already suffering from the impacts of climate change, our leaders should commit to the most effective solutions to help these communities adapt to a warming planet. Fortunately, we have countries, communities and businesses that are showing the way and investing in promising solutions. Since 2014, Costa Rica has generated almost all of its electricity from renewables. Bangladesh has vastly reduced the death toll from cyclones by investing in early-warning systems and rapid evacuation drills. China is combating coastal flooding with sponge cities that soak up excess water from torrential rains. Cities from Hyderabad to New York are painting rooftops white to reflect the sun and lower indoor temperatures during their sweltering summers. Farmers across the African Sahel are regreening vast tracts of semi-desert by coaxing tree roots back to life. Trees help retain more water in the soil, which improves agricultural yields and reduces the risk of famine. Cities such as Miami and Houston are already investing in flood defenses. New Yorks Staten Island is building a seawall. The longer we delay climate action, the higher that barrier will have to be. In transportation, too, we can see the future. By 2040, electric cars could make up 57% of all passenger car sales worldwide, while in China, 1.2 million new energy vehicles, which includes electric and hybrids, were sold last year. The Global Commission on Adaptation estimates that spending just $1.8 trillion on climate adaptation by 2030 will deliver $7.1 trillion in net benefits. Luckily, we are witnessing the beginnings of a revolution in the financial sector. More than 370 institutional investors with $41 trillion in assets under management have joined the Climate Action 100+ initiative to ensure that companies they invest in take necessary action on climate change. These investors are placing sustainability and climate risk at the center of their investment approach and committing to strong action on sustainability advocacy. That promises to be a game-changer for capital markets. Tragically, it is too late to save the victims of Australias apocalyptic bushfires this year, despite the efforts of the brave firefighters who have been battling to contain the flames, and the millions of animals that have perished. Here, too, we must reflect upon the immense and terrible costs of our negligence: Scientists predicted more than a decade ago that these fires would happen. When it comes to the clear and present danger of climate change, we have been crying wolf for too long. The window is narrowing and the time for pious concern is over. Unless we act now, we will soon be confronting a crisis of public trust as well as the climate crisis that is already upon us.",23/01/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/23/perspectives/fires-floods-climate-crisis-davos/index.html
"Warming temperatures could mean more heat-related illnesses and new diseases, experts warn","Rising temperatures triggering extreme weather events around the world could result in an increase in heat-related illnesses and deaths, as well as the threat of new infectious diseases, according to experts. We just wrapped the planets second-hottest year and the hottest decade in recorded history. Scientists predict that future summers will smash temperature records, with developing countries and small islands facing the greatest threat. Now a new paper published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, says that with climate change, we can expect cases of heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and potentially fatal heat strokes to climb. Our bodies have the ability to regulate themselves within a few degrees of the ideal core body temperature of 98.6Fahrenheit. Body temperature is influenced by the environment, homeostasis (internal mechanisms that maintain our bodies stability in order to survive), and the things we do to adapt to the external or outside temperature, like putting on a jacket when we feel cold or turning on the air conditioner when we feel warm. Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Professor Rexford Ahima said hotter temperatures will make heat waves more frequent and intense. Extreme heat will particularly impact children, older people, people who suffer from chronic conditions and those who live in underserved communities. This surge will impact tropical and sub-tropical regions the most, according to Ahima. Extreme heat was felt across the world last year. Record-setting and deadly heat waves swept Europe. In the United States, a heat wave threatened about 157 million Americans in July. That same month, temperatures in Alaska climbed to 90 degrees, an all-time high. Australia experienced record-breaking temperatures in December as historic fires continue burning across New South Wales state. Extreme heat spurred by global warming poses an existential threat to human populations, Ahima wrote in the medical journal, adding that solutions should include short-term strategies to adapt to the current temperatures, as well as long-term strategies to drastically reduce future emissions of greenhouse gases. Higher temperatures could also lead to a new crop of infectious diseases, according to a new paper by Arturo Casadevall, a professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Thats because microbes, Casadevall said, have the ability to adapt to warmer temperatures. Microbes live in water, soil, air, and in the human body too. Some microbes can make us sick. The most common types are bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Our immune system protects us from infectious diseases, including our ability to maintain a stable body temperature. One of these defenses is known as endothermy, which keeps our bodies warm, protecting us from potentially harmful microbes. One example is when we come down with a fever because of an infection: our bodies are working to kill the virus or bacteria that caused the infection. But Casadevall argued that some fungi species can adapt to higher temperatures, and those that can produce diseases on humans will break through the defenses our immune system provides us. Casadevall said that a large number of fungal species are known to have defeated the immunity of plants and cold-blooded animals. If [fungi] can adapt to higher temperatures, that could pose a new threat to humans, Casadevall said. Casadevall added the same logic can be applied to viruses, bacteria, and parasites. If these threats materialize, medicine will need to confront new infectious diseases for which it has no experience, Casadevall said. The World Health Organization this month listed both climate change, infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance among the health challenges were facing the next decade. WHO, the United Nations public health agency, noted that climate change has been linked with the spread of infectious diseases such as malaria.",30/01/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/29/health/climate-change-temperatures-health/index.html
Building projects in New Jersey will now have to account for climate change,"An executive order signed this week by Gov. Phil Murphy will make New Jerseys climate change regulations among the toughest in the nation. The order, which will require that rising sea levels and other effects of climate change be considered during the permitting process for buildings and infrastructure, comes as President Donald Trumps administration is continuing its rollback of federal environmental protections. The order also sets up requirements for the monitoring and reduction of greenhouse gases statewide. Our climate is already changing, Catherine McCabe, commissioner of New Jerseys Department of Environmental Protection, told CNN on Thursday. We dont have any more time to wait for a federal solution. The order met pushback from New Jersey Republicans. State Sen. Steven Oroho called the permitting requirements another impossible hoop to jump through. Theres no type of development that will escape Governor Murphys ability to withhold permits under opaque climate change considerations, Oroho said in a statement. He could use that language to block virtually any infrastructure improvement, home construction or commercial development. The details of what would be required in the permitting process is still a work in progress. McCabe told CNN that the rules wont be finalized for another two years as the state government seeks comment from various constituencies. She said that discussions with various stakeholders statewide were expected to begin before the end of February. Michael Egenton, the New Jersey Chamber of Commerces executive vice president for government relations, said his organization planned to be involved in the process as a stakeholder. After Superstorm Sandy, we have to think smarter and more strategically about where were going to build, Egenton told CNN. The devils in the details  were open to the process. Coastal resiliency has been a priority for New Jersey residents since 2012s Sandy killed a dozen people, destroyed more than 300,000 homes and caused massive coastal flooding. But William Sweet, an oceanographer with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told CNN that tidal flooding, unrelated to major storm events, is a growing problem for New Jersey and the East Coast generally. Theres an increased frequency of lesser events that are really starting to stack up, Sweet said. Its becoming disruptive. The toll is starting to show. Sea levels are rising. Communities are flooding more often, he said. Thats an unbiased observation. Whats expected this century is not a repeat of last. The level of ocean rise is trending particularly fast on the Eastern Seaboard, Sweet said. In New Jersey, sea levels are likely to rise between 2 and 4 feet in the next 80 years, he said. Even at the low end of that range, Sweet said, thats almost twice what was experienced in the last century in a place like Atlantic City. Murphy announced the executive order on the same day as his so-called energy master plan, which calls for the states energy production to be fully carbon-neutral by 2050.",31/01/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/30/us/new-jersey-climate-change-permit/index.html
"From a glacier break to record temperatures, Antarctica had quite the week in climate change","This week, an iceberg the size of Atlanta broke off a glacier. Researchers discovered a dramatic decline in Antarctic penguin colonies. And Antarctica may have just registered its hottest temperature ever. In case all of that was not enough to make you at least a little concerned, yet another unusually high temperature was logged in the Antarctic Peninsula on February 9, when a weather station on Seymour Island produced a reading of almost 70 degrees. The World Meteorological Association is trying to verify it as a new record. Though the WMO has not yet determined whether this reading breaks any sort of record, it certainly provides additional evidence of warming in the Antarctic region and around the world, according to Randall Cerveny, a meteorologist at Arizona State University and a climate extremes expert at the World Meteorological Organization. According to the organizations website, these events are all consistent with trends seen in Antarctica over the past few years. The Antarctic Peninsula, where the potentially record-breaking February temperatures were logged, is one of the fastest-warming regions on the planet. Our polar regions are kind of the canary in the mine, said Cerveny, They are a more sensitive environment, so they are a warning system to other areas of the world. The decline of the Antarctic penguin colonies provides evidence of the effects of this broader warming on the animals that inhabit these sensitive regions. The number of penguins on Elephant Island, where a recently released survey took place, is half what it was at the last survey in 1971. Noah Strycker, an ornithologist and penguin researcher at Stony Brook University, told CNN that climate change has removed these penguins primary food source, krill. Penguins, seals and whales all depend on krill, which depends on ice. So if climate change affects the ice, that impacts on everything else, he said in an earlier interview with CNN. While the penguin decline and Pine Island Glacier breakage were due to long-term influences, it is important to note that this weeks potentially record-breaking temperatures, if verified, are mostly due to a very specific weather event called a foehn, which causes unusually warm temperatures. The temperatures have already returned to normal, but this does not mean that Antarcticas rising temperatures should be disregarded, according to Ella Gilbert, a climate scientist who works at the British Antarctic Survey. Although we cant take single events as an indication of a long-term trend, extreme events like these are becoming more common as the climate changes, she told CNN.",14/02/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/14/world/antarctic-peninsula-climate-change-scn-trnd/index.html
Jeff Bezos commits $10 billion to fight climate change,"Jeff Bezos is throwing his weight  and wealth  behind the fight against climate change months after Amazon employees publicly pressured him and the company to do more to address the issue. The Amazon (AMZN) CEO on Monday announced a new fund to back scientists, activists and organizations working to mitigate the impact of climate change. Bezos will commit $10 billion to start, he said in an Instagram post. The initiative, called the Bezos Earth Fund, will begin giving out grants this summer. The $10 billion commitment constitutes less than 8% of the worlds richest mans estimated $130 billion net worth. Even so, it is one of the biggest charitable pledges ever, according to a ranking by the Chronicle of Philanthropy, behind a $36 billion commitment by billionaire Warren Buffett in 2006 and an estimated $16.4 billion pledge by Helen Walton, the late wife of Walmart (WMT) founder Sam Walton, in 2007. Climate change is the biggest threat to our planet, Bezos said in the post. I want to work alongside others both to amplify known ways and to explore new ways of fighting the devastating impact of climate change. Bezos has been under pressure from his employees to do more to protect the environment. Thousands of Amazon employees signed a letter last May asking how the company planned to respond to climate change, and many of them staged a walkout in September calling on it to do more. A day before the walkout, Amazon announced a pledge to go carbon neutral by 2040, ten years before the deadline set out by the Paris climate agreement. The company also said it will deploy 100,000 electric delivery vans by 2024. Its going to take collective action from big companies, small companies, nation states, global organizations, and individuals, Bezos said. Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, the group that staged last years walkout, responded to Bezos latest pledge by saying more needs to be done to address underlying causes like fossil fuel consumption. We applaud Jeff Bezos philanthropy, but one hand cannot give what the other is taking away, the group said in a statement Monday, calling on Amazon to stop working with oil and gas companies or funding think tanks that deny climate change. Will Jeff Bezos show us true leadership or will he continue to be complicit in the acceleration of the climate crisis, while supposedly trying to help? it added.",17/02/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/17/tech/bezos-earth-fund-climate-change/index.html
The world? top climate negotiator is feeling optimistic. She says you should too,"At first glance, Christiana Figueres doesnt have that many reasons to be optimistic. The Costa Rican diplomat played a pivotal role in negotiating the Paris Climate Agreement in 2015. But while the deal was widely praised as a landmark achievement, it has since begun to crumble. The United States left the pact under President Donald Trump, and negotiations over key aspects of the deals implementation have repeatedly failed. Yet Figueres says she still feels upbeat about fighting climate change. Its a deliberate choice, she told CNN in a video call. This is not about subjecting ourselves to huge sacrifices that lead us to feeling that were having a worse life, its actually exactly the opposite, she said. This is about moving toward a much better life, a life that has better health conditions, that has better urban conditions, that has better transport conditions, that has safer investment conditions. A slight woman with short hair, Figueres has the sort of no-nonsense attitude thats called for when the future of the world is at stake and its up to you to find a solution. She took over as the UNs top climate official in 2010, following the failed Copenhagen climate summit in 2009. When the Paris Agreement was signed five years later, Figueres was widely credited with making it happen. She also made the radical decision to bring the private sector and NGOs into the negotiations. The idea that fighting climate change will make peoples lives better is a key theme in Figueres upcoming book The Future We Choose. Figueres and the books co-author Tom Rivett-Carnac, who were both speaking from the Swiss ski resort of Davos for the World Economic Forum in January, told CNN their stubborn optimism is inspired by changes they have witnessed first hand. We are in a different world than we were two years ago, the level of civil disobedience that has emerged all around the world, we havent seen for a generation, its incredibly positive, Rivett-Carnac said. The former political strategist used to work with Figueres at the UN and the two have recently teamed up again to set up Global Optimism, an enterprise focused on environmental and social change. They make for a convincing duo. Rivett-Carnac towers over Figueres. She pokes fun at him for dressing up for a news interview. Besides the new book, they also run a podcast which has featured guests including David Attenborough, Jane Goodall and Bill Nye. Figueres and Rivett-Carnac believe that the climate protests and youth strikes seen around the world in recent months will eventually lead to the kind of fundamental change needed to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, a key goal of the Paris deal. Historically, social change comes about when 3.5% of the population is pressing for it, and thats amazing because we always think you need 100% of people and you dont, Figueres said. Were almost there, at the 3.5%. The protests have been credited with forcing politicians across the world to raise their game on climate change and introduce stricter targets. When nations signed the Paris Deal back in 2015, they agreed that global emissions of greenhouse gases must peak in 2020 at the latest, and then start coming down  or the world will face irreversible damage. Under current scenarios, emissions will need to fall by 7.6% every year in the next decade  way beyond what the governments of the world are currently pledging. According to the UN, if we rely only on the current climate plans, temperatures can be expected to rise by 3.2 degrees this century. Activists like Greta Thunberg and Extinction Rebellion are demanding their governments stick to the Paris ideas and come up with concrete plans. We do see rays of light, Figueres said, pointing to various plans for coal phase-out and increased investment in renewables. Whether thats going to add up to a global number, honestly, that remains to be seen, she said. Figueres said politics was another reason to be hopeful, because climate change is slowly ceasing to be a divisive issue. One example: when the United Kingdom held a general election in December, all the main parties broadly agreed on the need to tackle the problem. The UK has finally understood that this is not about party allegiance. This is about the fate of humanity and all humanity, no matter what party you belong to, she said. But the shift isnt uniform. In Europe, the discussion centers largely around finding the best way to combat climate change  how fast, and in what way. In the US and Australia, meanwhile, the issue remains a partisan one in which basic facts are still being debated. In the US, this issue came, or appeared to come, from the left, and it appeared to come part and parcel with increasing government regulation, Rivett-Carnac said. Naturally, those who are on the other side of that philosophical debate resist  without necessarily realizing that there are plenty of solutions that would be consistent with their political worldview. To shift that attitude, Figueres and Rivett-Carnac point to the idea of climate optimism. Rather than stoking fears about the future or making people give up stuff they care about, Figueres and Rivett-Carnac want to convince people that they are in charge. Fear does have a role, being woken up out of complacency does have a role... but we need to translate that into a matter of moving forward, Rivett-Carnac said. Figueres said humans need to realize they have the power to choose the future. That is an incredible opportunity and it is unique in the history of humankind, she said. My parents and generations before that didnt have the power to say we will write history, they just couldnt, because they didnt have the technology, they didnt have the capital, they didnt understand the policy. The problem, she said, is that there isnt much time to take this control: A decade, at best. Ten years from now, in 2030, we will either have written a very positive story, or we will really be condemned to an endless destruction. So for these 10 years were holding the pen, Figueres said.",19/02/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/19/world/climate-change-optimism-christiana-figueres-intl/index.html
"Climate change could kill all of Earth? coral reefs by 2100, scientists warn","Climate change could destroy almost all of Earths coral reef habitats by 2100, according to new research. About 70-90% of all existing coral reefs are expected to disappear in the next 20 years due to warming oceans, acidic water and pollution, said scientists from the University of Hawaii Manoa, who presented their findings Monday at an ocean sciences conference. By 2100, its looking quite grim, said Renee Setter, one of the University of Hawaii Manoa researchers, in a press release. Some environmental activists and coral reef researchers have been working on coral restoration  growing live corals in a lab, then placing them back into marine environments to try and revive dying reefs. But this may not be enough to save Earths reefs, the researchers warned. The new study mapped areas of the ocean that would be best suited to this type of coral restoration, taking into consideration factors like acidity, water temperature, human population density and fishing frequency. After examining the worlds oceans, they reached a somber conclusion: By 2100, few to zero suitable coral habitats will remain. Most parts of the ocean where coral reefs live today wont be suitable by 2045  and the health and condition of these environments are only likely to get worse by 2100, according to the teams simulations. Honestly, most sites are out, Setter said in the press release. There may only be a few viable sites for coral reef restoration by 2100, like portions of Baja California and the Red Sea  but even these arent ideal reef habitats because theyre close to rivers. The researchers warned that climate change was the big killer  human pollution, while a problem, is only a small part of the larger threat. Trying to clean up the beaches is great and trying to combat pollution is fantastic. We need to continue those efforts, Setter said in the release. But at the end of the day, fighting climate change is really what we need to be advocating for in order to protect corals and avoid compounded stressors. Scientists have been warning for years that the worlds reefs are heading for massive death and a planetary catastrophe, as ocean warming and acidification kill off entire swaths of reefs. The 1,500 mile-long (2,300 kilometer) Great Barrier Reef is the best-known example  it has endured multiple large scale bleaching events caused by above average water temperatures in the last two decades. Then, back-to-back marine heat waves in 2016 and 2017 killed about half of the corals on the Great Barrier Reef, along with many others around the world. One of the natural wonders of the world, the Great Barrier Reef is roughly the length of Italy  and provides a habitat for a diverse range of marine life. Up to a third of all marine species everywhere depend on the coral reefs, meaning a reef extinction could cause ecological collapse, experts warn. And these devastating effects will ripple out into human societies  almost a billion people worldwide rely on reefs as a source of food protein, according to Mark Eakin, coordinator for the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations Coral Reef Watch. Coral reefs also protect shorelines and infrastructure  meaning their death could threaten the safety and sustainability of coastal societies. In recent years, activists have been scrambling to find ways to save the reefs; environmental entrepreneurs have opened coral farms, which scales up and speeds up restoration efforts. Other scientists have also tried to use underwater loudspeakers to replicate the sounds of healthy reefs, in an attempt to entice fish back to dead reefs to help them recover. These attempts have been met with some success  and potentially buys the worlds reefs a little more time  but all of the scientists and entrepreneurs involved have warned its not enough to save them all. Almost nothing will be, they say  unless we take drastic action on climate change.",20/02/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/20/world/coral-reefs-2100-intl-hnk-scli-scn/index.html
Climate change may doom 1 in 3 species of plants and animals in the next 50 years,"Take a moment to cherish your plants and appreciate the animals you see around you. In 50 years, a third of them may no longer exist. Using data from surveys that studied 538 animals, insects and plants from 581 sites across the globe, researchers John J. Wiens and Cristian Roman-Palacios from the University of Arizona found that approximately one in three plant, insect and animal species could face extinction by 2070. However, things could be even worse if emissions continue to rise as rapidly as they have in recent decades. In a worst-case scenario, that number could rise to over 55%. Of the 538 species studied, 44% of them have already experienced an extinction in a particular local area. The researchers found that local extinction sites had larger and faster changes in the hottest yearly temperatures than those that did not. While many species were able to tolerate a moderate increase in maximum temperatures, 50% of the species had local extinctions if maximum temperatures increased by more than 0.5 degrees Celsius. That number rose to 95% if temperatures increased by more than 2.9 degrees Celsius. The researchers found that the key to predicting whether a population will go extinct is the maximum annual temperature, as opposed to the average yearly temperature. This is notable because average temperatures are typically used as markers in measuring climate change. With January going in the record books as the warmest January in 141 years and statistical analysis done by NOAA scientists predicting 2020 to be one of the five warmest years on record, the researchers believe there will be more local extinctions across the globe. And with summer heat waves potentially becoming more dangerous in the coming decades, the potential for loss of life will likely only grow from here. However, that number could drop if we make a collective effort to address climate change, they say. The Paris Agreement was signed in 2015 by ministers from 195 countries from around the globe. It committed these countries to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and below 1.5 degrees, if possible. The researchers found that achieving the Paris goals could be the difference between extinction and survival for many species. Based on our sample of 538 species, we projected a loss of 30% of the species under a more extreme warming scenario, but only about 16% if we stick to the Paris Agreement, Wiens told CNN. So, think in 1 in 6 species, not 1 in 3. The researchers believe that some species loss is inevitable at this point, no matter what we do to curb greenhouse gas emissions. However, it is still possible to protect biodiversity and prevent massive species loss. I think that we should focus on preserving forests and other habitats in tropical areas, and this is part of the Paris Agreement, Wiens said. Preserving forests protects biodiversity and can help reduce or even reverse global warming. Its a win-win. The Paris Agreement is an international pact aimed at curbing global emissions of heat-trapping gases. Unfortunately, studies have shown that so far, many countries are failing to meet the emissions cuts they set to limit climate change. Making matters worse, President Trump formally notified the United Nations that the U.S. would be pulling out of the Paris climate agreement in November. While it will take a full year for the U.S. to withdraw, losing the worlds second-largest contributor of greenhouse gas emissions makes it more difficult to reach the agreements goals. Some researchers have estimated that two-thirds of all species of plants and animals could be lost due to tropical deforestation alone, Wiens said. If you combine that with climate change (which can impact species in protected forests and other reserves), then it really is terrible. Even from our data alone, there are extreme warming scenarios where 55% of the species would be lost from intact habitats. And note that deforestation also increases global warming. It is a double whammy against biodiversity. Species that are in tropical regions are two to four times likelier to face extinction than those in temperate regions. This is a big problem, because the majority of plant and animal species occur in the tropics, Roman-Palacios said. Many species have migrated to cooler habitats to escape the warming temperatures, but the researchers found that most will not be able to disperse quickly enough to avoid extinction. In a way, its a choose your own adventure, Wiens said. If we stick to the Paris Agreement to combat climate change, we may lose fewer than two out of every 10 plant and animal species on Earth by 2070. But if humans cause larger temperature increases, we could lose more than a third or even half of all animal and plant species, based on our results.",21/02/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/21/weather/species-extinction-climate-trnd/index.html
Climate change is threatening winter sports?very existence,"A warming planet has major ramifications on winter snowpack across the globe, including a long-term drying trend for many. Thats a concern for winter sports enthusiasts and communities that depend on snow throughout the year. Not many understand this better than the climate advocacy group known as Protect Our Winters (POW). The group is an organization of professional athletes and like-minded individuals fighting for policy to protect winter sports and mountain communities. Increased temperatures are melting away both my sport and my livelihood, professional ski mountaineer and POW representative Caroline Gliech told the US Senate late last year. This year has been a prime example of what is becoming more common. Snowfall has been abysmal in California this winter. The state-wide snowpack is running far below average to date and there is little relief in sight before the season ends. This is a stark comparison to last year when California was walloped with above-average snowfall and ended the season 175% of average by April 1. Its this variability that leaves many wondering what the long-term trends are indicating. If climate science holds true, this winter whiplash could put many out of business as the low-snow years mount. And Californians are not alone. In the French Pyrenees mountains, one ski resort used helicopters to fly in the snow just so they could stay open after weeks of above-average temperatures and little snowfall. Years with below-average snowfall have a crushing impact on local economies. Bad winters can take more than $1 billion out of the US economy and affect more than 17,000 jobs, according to a 2018 study conducted by POW and REI. Since snowfall drives business in mountain towns, its no wonder that its often referred to as winters white gold. POW says that nearly 34 million Americans identify as an outdoor enthusiast. If you ski, snowboard, trail run, mountain climb or are a passionate outdoors person, you identify as an outdoor enthusiast. This is a potentially powerful community of people. Considering, according to these numbers, outdoor enthusiasts make up nearly a quarter of the individuals who voted in the 2016 presidential election. POW believes that the love of the outdoors crosses party lines and that policy to end the climate crisis needs to come from both sides of the aisle. We need the whole country, the whole world on this issue [climate change] and I firmly believe that together, we can protect our winters, professional snowboarder Jeremy Jones said during a Senate hearing about climate changes impacts on outdoor sports. Throughout the athletes careers, they say they have witnessed mountains become void of snow and glaciers retreat to just a fading memory. The athletes shared their first-hand experiences when appeared at a 2019 hearing on environmental issues related to their sports. Following their testimony, the Senate Democrats Climate Committee tweeted that Nothing and no one will be spared from the climate crisis  not even winter sports and the recreation industry it supports. Its not only the outdoor industry that is affected by lousy snow years. Lack of snowfall means less water in the spring. Usually, winter snowfall is like depositing money into a bank account for use at a later date. Without it, streams and underground water supplies can run dangerously low. Snowmelt from the Sierra Nevada Mountains provides roughly 75 percent of Californias agricultural water, and 60 percent of Southern Californias water resources, according to climate.gov. As the planet continues to warm, the likelihood of a below-average snowpack  like the amounts we see this year in California and the French Pyrenees  increases. Right now, 2020 is on track to be a below-average year but we could still see large storms in March and April that will improve the current snowpack, said Sean de Guzman, chief of water supply forecasting to the California Department of Water Resources. While periods of dry conditions are expected in California, climate change has made them more unpredictable and extreme which is why we must always use the water we have wisely. Climate change can seem too overwhelming to tackle on our own. POWs communications manager Samantha Kilgore told CNN. There are tangible things you can do now that make a big difference. She suggests contacting your elected officials or attending city council meetings. Vote, she said, and get your friends to vote. And get involved in broader systemic actions that can drive policy that will combat climate change.",29/02/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/29/weather/climate-change-threatening-winter-sports-pow/index.html
New York Times: Interior official pushes misleading information on climate crisis in agency reports,"An Interior Department official pushed misleading information about climate change into the agencys reports, according to The New York Times, at a time when the Trump administration has rolled back environmental protection regulations and repeatedly downplayed the effects of the climate crisis. Citing emails and documents from the department, the paper reported Monday that Indur M. Goklany, who was promoted to the office of the deputy secretary and tasked with reviewing climate policies in 2017, pushed misleading language in at least nine reports on environmental studies. The misleading information was also included in studies and statements about watersheds in Klamath and Upper Deschutes river basins in California and Oregon, the paper reported. The paper also reported Goks uncertainty language, as it was referred to internally and drawn from the officials nickname, inaccurately claimed there was disagreement among scientists about the earth warming. Goklany also told scientists that climate science may be overestimating the rate of global warming, for whatever reason, the paper reported, citing emails from 2017. He also directed scientists to say rising carbon dioxide is beneficial because it may increase plant water use efficiency and lengthen the agricultural growing season, the paper reported. Interior spokesman Connor Swanson called the report misleading, beginning with the headline. Mr. Goklany is not and has never been a Trump appointee. Rather, Mr. Goklany is a longstanding career civil servant whose service spans multiple decades and Administrations of both parties, Swanson told CNN Monday afternoon in a statement. The Department is committed to following the law, using the best available science and relying on the expertise from our professional career staff. By acknowledging the full range of outcomes, we incorporate the most comprehensive analysis of climate in our decision making. Goklany did not return requests seeking comment from the Times. The Interior Department referred inquiries from the paper to the Bureau of Reclamation, who published the language. Marlon Duke, the bureaus acting public affairs chief, said uncertainty is a part of climate modeling, as it is with all scientific modeling. Duke also told the paper the bureau was not formally required to include specific language in documents, but we strive to be fully transparent in recognizing and sharing appropriate uncertainties in the information we use to make decisions. The Trump administration has been criticized by environmental activists over its response to the climate crisis. CNNs KFile previously reported that William Perry Pendley, who leads the Department of Interiors Bureau of Land Management, has repeatedly denied the existence of climate change and falsely claimed in a speech there was no credible evidence of a hole in the ozone layer.",02/03/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/02/politics/interior-official-climate-change/index.html
The young conservatives who believe Greta Thunberg and want to bring Republicans with them,"Something was different at CPAC 2020. Sure, Fox News and the NRA were in their regular spots between booths full of deplorable hammocks, Donald Trump nutcrackers and a life-size statue of the President, made of nails and posed as Superman. But in the middle of this years Conservative Political Action Conference, the booth cocking the most eyebrows was focused on climate change  not as something to deny or mock  but as a crisis to fight. With taxes! Between cardboard cutouts of Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, young men in ties and ball caps tried to convince the curious (and the occasional heckler) to ignore everything theyve been told about global warming at CPACs past. Looming across the aisle was The Heartland Institute, the powerful think tank long devoted to denying global warming science, and two booths down stood Climate Hustle 2 (starring television Hercules Kevin Sorbo) but the Young Conservatives for Carbon Dividends worked a crowd two-people-deep with the confidence of CPAC veterans. This is really a generational issue, Harvard senior and YCCD founder Kiera OBrien told me. We believe that people my age and a little bit older are really waking up to the problem that is climate change on both sides of the aisle. A few hours later at a bar around the corner, University of Washington senior Benji Backer addressed his rival group of Republican climate hawks, the American Conservation Coalition. It is really awesome to see such an amazing crowd of conservatives who care about the environment here, he beamed to the packed happy hour crowd. OBrien and Backer embody the latest polling from organizations like the Pew Research Center that found that while less than a third of Republican Boomers think the government isnt doing enough on climate change, over half of young Republicans do. And 78% of Republicans from the millennial generation and younger say the US should prioritize renewable energy over fossil fuel. But as more young conservatives agree with Greta Thunberg that humanitys house is on fire, it is opening up new debates with  and among  those on the right over the best way to put it out. I dont believe that we need to end fossil fuels overnight, Backer told me on a stroll through Olympic National Park. I think that there are ways to transition over multiple, multiple decades to cleaner technologies. As a kid in Wisconsin, he began knocking on doors for John McCain and the Tea Party movement at age 10. When he realized that the party of Teddy Roosevelt was denying or ignoring man-made damage to his beloved outdoors, he formed the ACC, now on 205 campuses, he says. The group opposes a carbon tax and the government regulation thats being suggested for a Green New Deal by millennials on the left like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Instead, Backer says free market forces could decarbonize the global economy, with incentives for carbon capture, regenerative agriculture, clean technology and tree planting. Every one of my generation wants to buy a Tesla. Everyone in my generation wants to have solar panels on their roofs. That demand is there. Thats a culture change that no government policy could ever enact, that is shifting the way that we look at climate change and our economy, Backer says. But its not going to take just one policy. OBrien and her Young Conservatives for Carbon Dividends disagree. She formed her group to promote the so-called Baker-Shultz plan of the Climate Leadership Council. I would say this IS the market-based solution, she said. This is the solution that is backed by the largest statement of economists in the history of the profession of economics! A child of Yosemite Park Rangers, she was born in Alaska and fell in love with nature in a state that taxes the oil flowing through their famous pipeline and sends an annual dividend check to every year-round resident. Its currently paying for my college education, she said. It really makes a difference for Alaskan families. The nationwide action she supports was published in 2017 by Reagan-era cabinet members James Baker and George Shultz and six other authors, and proposes a carbon tax of $40 per ton that would gradually go up in order to drive down fossil fuel demand and spur clean energy innovation. To help cover the higher costs of fuel, the tax would pay the average American family around $2,000 a year in dividend and slap a border adjustment on the cost of imported fossil fuel to urge other nations to fall in line. But central to the plan is a provision that makes most environmentalists recoil: complete deregulation of carbon. So no restrictions on mining coal, fracking or drilling for oil in the United States. It is one big reason Baker-Shultz has the support of oil giants like ExxonMobil and BP. Corporations like Microsoft and Ford and an assortment of strange political bedfellows, including the late Stephen Hawking, Ben Bernanke, hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio and Christiana Figueres, lead negotiator for the Paris Climate Accord, are all listed as founding supporters. OBrien boasts that such a pedigree has lured the support of around half of the nations College Republican state chairs and vice chairs. Those are your next generation leaders of the Republican Party. And when you come with that pitch, party leaders tend to listen. But the idea is a heavy political lift regardless of party. Neither leading Democratic candidate for President, Bernie Sanders or Joe Biden, has a carbon tax in their climate plans and President Donald Trump continues to downplay urgent warnings of American scientists. His administration is stacked with former fossil fuel lobbyists fighting for the most dramatic rollback of environmental and climate protection laws in history. But while both OBrien and Backer are visibly conflicted by the idea of voting for Trump in 2020, both are driven by the hope he could be swayed. I would love for President Trump to sign a plan just like this, OBrien said. I mean, attitudes can change in the future. Were betting on it with the Republican Party as a whole. I see no reason why President Trump couldnt change his mind as well. He started to say that climate change is real, which is a huge difference from where hes been before, Backer said after pointing out that Trumps approval rating on the environment is the lowest of any issue. People on both sides say Im a wolf in sheeps clothing. But if he changed his tune and said tomorrow, I want a big climate change policy, I will work with anybody, whether thats Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or President Trump. This story has been updated with the latest number of campuses where the ACC is present, according to Benji Backer.",06/03/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/06/politics/young-green-republicans-climate-weir-wxc/index.html
"The climate crisis is disrupting life for millions, a report finds","After declining for most of the last decade, hunger is once again on the rise around the world, and climate change is a primary cause. Over 820 million people suffered from hunger in 2018, the greatest number since 2010 according to findings from a new World Meteorological Organization report released today. The wide-ranging State of the Climate report outlines the latest science and includes data from a variety of disciplines in order to evaluate the current and future impacts of climate change on everything from heath and global economies to food insecurity and refugee displacements. Climate variability is one of the key contributors to this increase in global disruptions due to food insecurity, displacement, and deaths from disasters. Food supplies in some of the most vulnerable regions in the world are being directly affected by impacts such as crop failures and locust swarms. Exceptional drought followed by extremely heavy rainfall markedly decreased the seasonal crop yield in the Horn of Africa during 2019. These irregular weather and climate patterns also contributed to the worst desert locust invasion in 25 years, which further threatened the crop supply in the region. As a result, by the end of 2019, over 22 million people in the Horn of Africa alone were estimated to be severely food insecure. High-impact weather events in 2019 were largely to blame for up to 22 million estimated displacements of people due to disasters, up more than 25% over 2018. Floods and storms contributed the most, including Tropical Cyclone Idai in Mozambique and Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas  each of which dropped unprecedented amounts of rainfall and displaced tens of thousands of residents. During two separate summer European heatwaves, all-time record temperatures were notched in several countries across Europe and at least 1,462 deaths were recorded. But the impacts on human health extend beyond just hunger and heat-related illness. The dengue virus, a mosquito-borne illness, has seen its global incidence grow dramatically in recent decades and now threatens about half of the worlds population, the report finds. Australia experienced record warm temperatures and extreme drought, creating the perfect storm for the wildfires that burned over 7 million hectares (17 million acres) in New South Wales and Victoria alone. The fire activity wasnt just confined to Australia, though, Siberia and South Americas Amazon rain forests saw massive wildfires as well. The extremes dont stop there, as the global thermostat continues to rise, along with many of the other tell-tale symptoms of global warming. The global-average temperature was 1.1 degree Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit) above the pre-industrial era, topping off 2010-2019 as the warmest decade on record. The findings of this report are not surprising, as the WMO released another report in January stating that 2019 was the second-warmest year on record. Only 2016 was warmer, due to a strong El Nino event that heated the globe naturally. In 2019, the global mean sea level reached its highest value on record, due to the melting ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica as well as continuing heating of the ocean, which the report notes once again reached its highest levels of heat in the upper 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) of ocean depth. Given that greenhouse gas levels continue to increase, the warming will continue. A recent decadal forecast indicates that a new annual global temperature record is likely in the next five years. It is a matter of time, said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas. Climate change is making these extremes more common, This latest report serves as a valuable mile-marker of the climate crisis. Without climate action, populations around the globe can expect to see continued disruptions to their everyday lives. This report is a catalogue of weather in 2019 made more extreme by climate change, and the human misery that went with it, according to Brian Hoskins, chair of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change at Imperial College in London and not associated with the WMO State of the Climate. It points to a threat that is greater to our species than any known virus  we must not be diverted from the urgency of tackling it by reducing our greenhouse gas emissions to zero as soon as possible.",10/03/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/10/weather/climate-report-wmo-2019-wxc/index.html
There? an unlikely beneficiary of coronavirus: The planet,"Factories were shuttered and streets were cleared across Chinas Hubei province as authorities ordered residents to stay home to stop the spread of the coronavirus. It seems the lockdown had an unintended benefit  blue skies. The average number of good quality air days increased 21.5% in February, compared to the same period last year, according to Chinas Ministry of Ecology and Environment. And Hubei wasnt alone. Satellite images released by NASA and the European Space Agency show a dramatic reduction in nitrogen dioxide emissions  those released by vehicles, power plants and industrial facilities  in major Chinese cities between January and February. The visible cloud of toxic gas hanging over industrial powerhouses almost disappeared. This is the first time I have seen such a dramatic drop-off over such a wide area for a specific event, says Fei Liu, an air quality researcher at NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center. I am not surprised because many cities nationwide have taken measures to minimize the spread of the virus. A similar pattern has emerged with carbon dioxide (CO2)  released by burning fossil fuels such as coal. From February 3 to March 1, CO2 emissions were down by at least 25% because of the measures to contain the coronavirus, according to the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), an air pollution research organization. As the worlds biggest polluter, China contributes 30% of the worlds CO2 emissions annually, so the impact of this kind of drop is huge, even over a short period. CREA estimates it is equivalent to 200 million tons of carbon dioxide  more than half the entire annual emissions output of the UK. As a measure that took place effectively overnight, this is more dramatic than anything else that Ive seen in terms of the impact on emissions, said Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst at CREA. But while lockdown measures designed to stem the spread of the virus have caused a momentary uptick in Chinas pollution levels, experts warn that when the county starts to reboot its economy the toxic chemicals could up to higher levels than before the epidemic hit. A fall in oil and steel production, and a 70% reduction in domestic flights, contributed to the fall in emissions, according to the CREA. But the biggest driver was the sharp decline in Chinas coal usage. China is the worlds biggest producer and consumer of coal, using this resource for 59% of its energy in 2018. As well as running power plants and other heavy industries, coal is also the sole heat source for millions of homes in the vast rural areas of the country. The countrys major coal-fired power stations saw a 36% drop in consumption from February 3 to March 1 compared to the same period last year, according to CREA analysis of WIND data service statistics. The largest consumers of coal  coal-fired power plants  have been affected a lot because electricity demand is down, said Myllyvirta. I think its clear that this effect will continue for the next weeks and months, because there has also been a major impact on the demand side of the economy. In 2017, President Xi Jinping promised to make combating pollution one of Chinas three battles, and the following year the Ministry of Ecology and Environment was created. The policies have resulted in a significant impact, with overall pollution levels 10% lower across Chinese cities between 2017 and 2018, according to a report released last year by Greenpeace and AirVisual. Climate activists say the crisis could provide a window to ramp up these promised reforms. We would very much advocate for China to foster this opportunity to transform its economy, to break apart from the old, said Li Shuo, a senior climate policy adviser for Greenpeace East Asia. The concern, Li said, is that once the coronavirus threat has passed, China will be solely focused on restarting its economy, which was already hurting in the wake of the US-China trade war. That could come at the expense of the environment. There might be a round of economic stimulus which would inject cheap credits to heavy industries in China, and as a result of that we might see increasing pollutants and also carbon emissions in the second half of this year, Li added. This bounce-back effect  which can sometimes reverse any overall drop in emissions  is something Li calls revenge pollution. And in China it has precedent. In 2009, the Chinese government launched a giant $586 billion stimulus package in response to the global financial crisis  the majority of which went to large-scale infrastructure projects. But the resulting explosion in pollution in the following years  particularly in the airpocalypse winter of 2012-2013  led to a public outcry which ushered in the Chinese governments first national air pollution action plan in September 2013. President Xi has made clear that workers and factories need to ramp up activity as soon as possible if the country is to avoid a steeper economic downturn. Myllyvirta hopes China has learned lessons from the past. It was really those previous episodes where it boiled over, says Myllyvirta, who also warns of a public backlash if the skies turn gray again. The reduction in air pollution has been very clear so if the pollution does come back, because of stimulus measures, because of heavy industry going into overdrive to make up for lost time, there could be a counter reaction. In neighboring Hong Kong, air quality has also improved since the city entered partial shutdown mode to combat the spread of the coronavirus. Key air pollutants dropped by nearly a third from January to February, according to data from Hong Kong University School of Public Health, which was analyzed by environmental organization Clean Air Network. Monitoring of stations in the busiest areas of Hong Kong, including Central, Causeway Bay and Mongkok, revealed that the fine particle pollutant PM2.5 decreased by 32%, while the larger particle pollutant PM10 fell by up to 29%, and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) was reduced by up to 22%. Pollution in the city is mostly caused by motor vehicles, marine vessels, and power plants in Hong Kong and around the Pearl River Delta, the government says. The declines in harmful pollutants came in direct correlation with the Hong Kong governments introduction of measures including working from home procedures, the closure of some public facilities, and a partial closure of the border with China. A drop in pollution in mainland China during this period also resulted in less regional smog from the industrial powerhouse cities in the southern province of Guangdong. There are lots of people who work from home, and that has reduced the traffic and the traffic congestion, said Patrick Fung, chairman of the Clean Air Network. Hong Kongs measures were nowhere near as drastic as those in mainland China, but there was still a significant impact. Fung has been campaigning about the long-term health impact of the air pollution in Hong Kong, which he says causes on average 1,500 premature deaths per year in the city. For the last decade, Hong Kongs air pollution has been double the World Health Organizations recommended safe level, Fung says. Especially at the roadside, where a lot of pedestrians and commuters are exposed to that kind of toxic and carcinogenic air pollutants. Hong Kongs government did introduce a raft of green policies in its recent budget, including a roadmap on cleaner public transport vehicles. Fung says the announcement was a good first step, but much more needs to be done. Now, Fung believes this brief period of cleaner air should send a message for people to push for longer-term changes. If we want the children, the elderly, who could live healthily in Hong Kong, then we should think how to make business as usual change, Fung says.",17/03/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/16/asia/china-pollution-coronavirus-hnk-intl/index.html
The pandemic isn? fixing climate change,"The internet has deemed 2020 canceled. And now everyones looking for a silver lining. But you know whats not a silver lining of this pandemic? Fixing the climate crisis. We havent fixed it, arent fixing it, and the way were talking about all of this is gross. Youve probably seen these headlines  that air pollution and heat-trapping emissions appear to be down as the world economy sits idle. Millions of people are trapped at home while Covid-19, the novel coronavirus, sweeps the globe. Were not consuming in the way that we normally would. Were not flying, driving, gathering, meeting  basically, were not doing at all. And yes, all of these inactions curb pollution  a bit. But lets not get ahead of ourselves. The public conversation, online and off, has been too quick to celebrate the unintended consequences of a pandemic that, remember, is killing thousands of people. One Twitter user wrote: -Venice Canal has become clear -Italy Coasts have dolphins coming nearer -Japan has deers (sic) roaming the streets -Thailand has monkeys doing the same -China has record-breaking pollution cuts, The Earth is healing. Um, no. It is amazing how a very complex system that is ruling our climate  how quickly that can change, how rapidly, Alexander Verbeek, a Dutch environmentalist, said in an interview with TRT World. For instance, in New York City, there was a study that because of less cars, the carbon monoxide  not the carbon dioxide  is down 50%, and carbon dioxide is down something like 5% to 10% just because of the reductions of cars in New York ... We saw in China a reduction of 25% in the CO2 emissions. So, it proves that it can be done. Verbeek is someone I respect. He and others are careful to say theyre not celebrating the loss of life, or that weve solved the climate crisis because pollution is down. But a brief pause on our normal emission levels related to Covid-19 does not prove we are going to reduce emissions in the longer term, as we must. And real solutions to the climate crisis dont look like this. Others are troubled by these associations, too. [I]t doesnt feel right to celebrate [a reduction in CO2 emissions] when it comes at the high cost of the lives of people  elders, sick and disabled people, and an increase in racist attacks against the Asian community worldwide, Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner, wrote on Facebook recently. She is a poet, artist and activist from the Marshall Islands, a country in the Pacific that could disappear beneath rising seas because of climate change. Real, meaningful climate action is all about being inclusive, and it doesnt leave our most vulnerable community members behind. My beef with the corona-climate chatter goes beyond decorum. There are a couple of odd associations at play here. Policy wonks have spent years debunking the myth that economic growth and fossil fuel pollution march in lockstep. They dont. There have been periods of time when emissions declined while economies continued to grow. How exactly to curb global warming pollution is the source of healthy debate, but its clear society can be prosperous  and healthy  and also avoid existential collapse in the form of climate apocalypse. Its not either-or. The truth is that fixing global warming will not be easy, but it will not look like this. It will look like cleaner technologies, different sources of power  wind, not coal  cleaner, denser, more-walkable cities. It will look like plant-based diets, more trees, electric planes, and so on. It looks like carbon taxes and regulating (and prosecuting) of still-powerful fossil fuel interests. It looks like action, not inaction; taking to the streets, not staying home. Ive also seen smart writers draw parallels between the urgency with which many individuals (thankfully) are responding to the Covid-19 pandemic and the urgency thats needed to respond to the climate crisis. Yes, we need urgent action on climate. But motivation matters. I see no reason to believe that the pollution-reductions associated with the pandemic will last beyond the duration of this public-health crisis. We need the public to see and be motivated by the very real and very clear dangers of the climate crisis  and for that motivation to continue in the long-haul, well beyond coronavirus, well beyond the decade, in fact. If anything, the Covid-climate talk may fool some people into thinking weve already fixed global warming  that a slight leveling-off of some pollutants means we bought more time. We havent. Were already on borrowed time. The climate crisis is an emergency, too, and has been for decades. A NASA scientist, James Hansen, testified about global warming in the US Senate in 1988, saying the era of global warming had begun. Alarm bells have continued to ring throughout the years from scientists, from the UN, and from many world leaders. We now have only a matter of years not just to slow fossil fuel pollution but to eliminate it. If theres one tiny silver lining that I take from the way individuals are responding to the coronavirus pandemic, its that social norms can and do change on a dime. Elbow bumps, video chats, social-distanced picnics, hanging out the window and banging pots at 8 p.m. in support of medical workers and others on the front lines  all of these have become not just normal but expected behaviors in many peer groups, seemingly overnight. We can and should make the same shift in attitudes toward fossil fuels  stigmatizing flying, driving gas-guzzlers, eating beef, and so on. And, more importantly, because climate change is a system problem, not just an individual one, we can change our attitudes toward politicians who enable the status quo. We can  and must  choose to fix global warming. But it wont happen on the coattails of a deadly pandemic.",27/03/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/27/opinions/pandemic-not-fixing-climate-change-sutter/index.html
"Climate change is making nightingales?wings shorter and their annual migration harder, study finds","Nightingales may be less likely to survive their annual migration because climate change is causing the songbirds to evolve shorter wings, new research has found. Scientists discovered that over the past two decades, the wingspan of nightingales from central Spain has decreased. They highlighted natural selection caused by rising average temperatures in the region as the likely cause of the trend. Nightingales flock to sub-Saharan Africa every year, but the researchers from the Complutense University of Madrid warned that the birds find it harder to return if their wingspans are stunted. Their study was published Wednesday in the journal The Auk: Ornithological Advances. There is much evidence that climate change is having an effect on migratory birds, changing their arrival and laying dates and their physical features over the last few decades, lead author Carolina Remacha said in a statement. If we are to fully understand how bird populations adapt to new environments in order to help them tackle the challenges of a rapidly changing world, it is important to call attention to the potential problems of maladaptive change, she added. In Spain, the spring season has shifted later in the year and droughts over the summer have become longer and more intense, meaning nightingales have a shorter window in which they can raise their young, the team said. That timetable has led to the more successful birds having smaller clutches (or groups of eggs), which affects wingspan and potentially other important survivalist features because of the unique way the songbirds genes interact. The migratory gene package theory dictates that a number of features which help nightingales survive their migration  including wingspan, a high resting metabolic rate, shorter lifespans and larger clutches  all interact with each other, so if one is negatively affected, all the other can be weakened too. That means having fewer offspring due to a warming climate is likely also responsible for the birds having shorter wingspans, the researchers said. The impact of climate change on numerous bird species has been well documented. Research by the National Audubon Society last year found that two-thirds of North American bird species  389 different species  are at risk of extinction from climate change. Another independent study said that said nearly 3 billion birds have disappeared from the United States and Canada in the past half a century. And further research in 2019 stated that the sizes of birds in the US has changed over the past four decades, likely as a result of the changing climate  although that study found that the birds bodies were shrinking but their wingspans were getting wider.",01/04/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/01/europe/nightingales-wingspan-climate-change-scn-scli-intl/index.html
Will we learn lessons for tackling climate change from our current crisis?,"Crises tend to bring out some of the best and the worst in us. We have watched in awe and admiration as health care professionals have responded with superhuman dedication to the Covid-19 pandemic. We have heard neighbors serenading each other across balconies. Car manufacturers are retooling to produce respirators and face masks that are so desperately needed by hospitals right now. Around the world, 1.7 billion people are staying at home to slow down the spread of the virus, according to The Guardian. Never, it seems, have there been so many visible acts of collective solidarity, and of such magnitude. But there have also been acts of craven selfishness. Cyberattacks on Spanish hospitals, where thousands are in intensive care. Profiteering and hoarding of life-saving medical supplies. World leaders who put their citizens in danger by denying the gravity of the situation. What this shows is that as individuals and as communities, we have a choice in how to respond to global threats. For the greater good we can accept restrictions on how we live, even at a cost to incomes and livelihoods  as 20% of the global population is doing right now, as The Guardian wrote  or we can respond selfishly, seeking only what is right for us, rather than the collective good of humanity. These choices will continue to be important once Covid-19 is tamed. Because what should be clear is that other threats, most notably our ongoing climate emergency, have not gone away during the pandemic. Many experts see a link between the two. Inger Andersen, head of the United Nations Environment Programme, says Covid-19 is a clear warning shot given that 75% of all infectious diseases come from wildlife, and climate change and the destruction of natural habitats are putting humans into ever-closer proximity to animals. Nature is sending us a message, she says, as The Guardian reported. Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at New York University, tweeted that the virus is climate change on warp speed. Pope Francis, meanwhile, praying in a deserted St. Peters Square on March 28, said: nor did we listen to the cry of the poor or of our ailing planet. We carried on regardless, thinking we would stay healthy in a world that was sick. If nature is sending us a message, what is it saying? It is telling us that we need to heal the planet if we want to heal ourselves. That we must be respectful of the boundaries between humans and other species; that we need to adapt and alter our behavior. And while we make these changes, we need to build our societies resilience to emergencies of all kinds, because our current planning and preparation for viruses, for rising seas and other effects of climate change, are not enough. Whether you are dealing with a deadly virus or extreme weather, prevention is always better than cure. It makes economic sense to build greater resilience against climate change now, in the same way that we must strengthen our health care systems before the next pathogen strikes. The Global Commission on Adaptation estimates that investing just $1.8 trillion in building resilience against climate change over the next decade could generate $7.1 trillion in total net benefits. Investment in green technology and resilient infrastructure could help put our coronavirus-shattered world back together again. Renewable energy instead of coal; natural drainage systems instead of more concrete to soak up water and avert floods; reforestation instead of land clearances. Around the world, governments are launching gigantic stimulus packages to prop up their economies. But these are being targeted exclusively within national borders; more attention must be paid to helping those around the world who need it most. It is also clear to us that to avert disaster, countries will need to help each other. World governments urgently need to mobilize a global fund to help the worlds poorest countries cope with Covid-19. The precedent is there: In the aftermath of the Ebola epidemic, the United Nations established a trust fund and led the international community to support recovery priorities. We believe the whole UN system, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and all regional development banks should come together again to address the aftershocks of the pandemic, including the global economic fallout. If the virus is a shared global challenge, so too should be the need to build resilience against future shocks. Emerging and developing countries are the least prepared for the arrival of Covid-19, just as they are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. To avoid a protracted global recession, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Secretary-General Angel Gurria has called for a response akin to the last centurys Marshall Plan and New Deal  combined. If it does come about, we hope it will not forget those in the developing world. For how these vast sums are invested will determine our future. Governments could opt for business as usual, perpetuating our old way of life, or they could heed natures Covid-19 warning and kick-start the transition to a low-carbon future. This means investing in life-supporting systems such as a stable climate, fresh air and clean water, and the preservation of natural habitats. The lifesaving benefits of building climate resilience are already evident in countries that have invested in early-warning systems against cyclones and hurricanes. Tropical cyclones killed hundreds of thousands of people in Bangladesh, a low-lying delta country, throughout the 20th century, but thanks to investment in warning systems, evacuation drills and strong shelters, millions of people can now shelter in safety before cyclones strike. This pandemic is far from over, but it has already brought certain truths (which should have been evident) into stark relief: that viruses do not respect borders; that without solidarity, we will not defeat this pandemic, because we are only as safe as our most vulnerable people; that scientific knowledge and advice matter; and that delay is deadly. The same lessons hold true for our climate emergency. If we are wise, we will start acting on these lessons now.",09/04/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/09/opinions/climate-change-lessons-from-covid-19-ban-verkooijen/index.html
"Preventing pandemics, global warming and environmental degradation all at once","The Earth and its inhabitants face three global crises: the pandemic crisis, the climate crisis and biodiversity crisis. Unto themselves, each already feels overwhelming  in terms of public-health consequences, the speed and scale of impacts, and the transformative actions needed to keep the planet habitable. One commonality lies at the core of these massive global challenges: the destructive relationship between humanity and the natural world. Human activities drive these invisible enemies, and our hope for the future will derive from solutions based on caring for nature. With Covid-19-related mortality expected to be high in vulnerable populations, at least one expert, NYU climate economist Gernot Wagner, has likened the pandemic to climate change at warp speed. The exponential growth rate of Covid-19 makes the pandemic far more apparent to most people, on a daily basis, than a warming planet. Yet the devastating recent fires in Australia and the loss of Pacific islands to sea-level rise remove any doubt that climate change is a fast-moving crisis. We already know the links between climate change and the third crisis, biodiversity loss. A 2019 report from the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services outlined the consequences for humanity of the rampant erosion of ecosystems across Earth. The report highlighted clear evidence of reductions in pollination, water regulation, soil health and pollution regulation among a myriad of lost natural capital. It also provided evidence that intact ecosystems  especially our vast tropical and boreal forests  play a critical role in abating runaway climate change. These areas soak up around 30% of mankinds carbon emissions each year and will continue to provide this huge service if effectively conserved. Such natural systems also offer humanity its best defense against climate change by regulating local climate, for example, and reducing risks of climate-related hazards such as sea-level rise and floods. Areas of high biological diversity often also hold a high level of viral diversity. As such, increased degradation of our worlds intact ecosystems can pose human health risks. Scientists use the term zoonosis to refer to infectious diseases like Covid-19 (caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2) that spread from animals to humans. The current pandemic has been associated with a market in Wuhan, China, where the flow of wild animals from forest frontiers to urban communities likely provided the source of infection. Yet wild animals themselves do not cause the problem. Rather, people continue to place increased pressures on the Earths remaining biodiverse ecosystems. Activities such as the commercial wildlife trade, logging and deforestation, and the expansion of agriculture into previously undisturbed areas alter the normal circulation of viruses. These changes can increase contact and exchange-rates of pathogens between wildlife and humans. In other words, as humanity encroaches further into nature, people have a greater chance of coming into contact with new pathogens carried by animals, and humanity finds itself at greater risk of pandemics like the one unfolding now. The problems of pandemics, climate and biodiversity loss are linked  but so are the solutions. Ending the commercial trade of wildlife for human consumption would drastically mitigate that exposure, limiting the risk of pathogens spilling over from animals to humans and causing disease outbreaks. At the same time, protecting ecosystems from human encroachment helps maintain biodiversity and mitigate climate change, by maintaining plant life that absorbs carbon from the atmosphere. Only a few months ago, we looked to 2020 as the super year for biodiversity and climate change. Nations that signed onto international conventions on climate (CoP 26) and biodiversity (CoP 15) hoped to finalize global strategic plans looking to 2030. With the key climate and biodiversity meetings delayed due to the pandemic, coordinated action remains pressing. Perhaps the Covid-19 crisis itself may still bring negotiators together (in spirit if not in person) for unified action, if the global pandemic manages to rouse a sense of solidarity among world governments. When it comes to reducing threats to our health, the climate, and biodiversity, we know that the tools of protecting intact forests and reducing forest degradation work well. The world  and all its citizens and leaders  must embrace natural solutions to head off these three crises. Proactively conserving and restoring our remaining intact ecosystems represents a key strategy to halt climate change, biodiversity loss, and  we must hope  the next pandemic. This article has been updated to clarify that the authors argue ending commercial wildlife trade for human consumption, specifically, would mitigate human exposure to pathogens. It has also been updated to reflect that James Watson is a professor, not associate professor, of conservation science at the University of Queensland.",22/04/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/22/opinions/pandemics-global-warming-linked/index.html
Why facing our feelings is essential for tackling our climate crisis,"Editors note: Renee Lertzman Ph.D. more opinion at CNN. Thirty years ago, I sat in a darkened lecture hall listening to what was happening to our Earth because of the decisions people had made. Climate change, toxic contamination, species loss, forest fires, soil depletion: it was a litany of all the ways humans had gone very wrong. At least, thats how it felt to me, at age 19. Human behavior was directly influencing the globes weather patterns. It was almost unthinkable. Apparently, it was so unthinkable for those around me  that people were literally not thinking about it. Meanwhile, my world was turned upside down, forcing me to reassess almost everything  how I traveled, what I ate, wore, what I drank out of, slept in, even put on my face  surprisingly intimate things. It also made me think about who I was in the world, and who I wanted to be. I did not identify as a scientist, activist or radical. Yet, at that time, those seemed to be the only people who understood our lethal and dangerous trajectory. I tried talking with other people about it. I wanted to understand what I was feeling, and why others seemed somehow immune. Was it grief? Was it a unique, new kind of anxiety? A crisis of epistemic trust  the helplessness Dr. Daniel Siegel calls when the world no longer seems trustworthy? It was all of the above. Yet at that time, not many people wanted to talk about it. This is now changing. And thats a good thing, because its the ticket to our collective survival. As we face a global pandemic, tornadoes march across our country, forests burn, waters rise and warm, corals bleach, jungles disappear, floods decimate entire regions, and storms devastate coastlines. More and more people are feeling overwhelmed, anxious and despairing. And heres the thing: we really need to be talking about this. Openly, without judgment, shame, blame, guilt or emotional policing. We are seeing huge numbers of people starting to bravely name their feelings, openly: I am scared. I feel overwhelmed. I feel powerlessness. I feel angry. Such as Hugh, who struggles with anxiety and wrote into CNN before the climate town hall, Ive been losing sleep after reading a report that talks about how climate change could lead to the collapse of civilization by 2050. A few years ago, this comment would have seemed extreme. This is no longer the case. It just hasnt been acknowledged as openly  until now. And thats a very good thing, especially in this uncertain, anxious and precarious time. We are all seeking meaning at a time of such radical uncertainty and upheaval. And so the talking heads come out: we should prepare for an apocalypse, mobilize, activate, solve problems, come together, dialogue, innovate, grieve, cry or simply check out. But were missing a crucial step. We need to name and acknowledge our feelings; if we dont, we cant move forward. As neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux reminds us, Body hormones, such as cortisol, help us cope with stress. But as with any useful chemical, you can have too much of a good thing. Prolonged, intense stress can raise the levels of cortisol beyond the point where they are useful and can impair memory processing and decision making systems that normally help us be effective amidst uncertainty and change. If we can keep our stress at levels that are useful rather than harmful, we can help ourselves and others be in the zone where we are able to use memory and foresight to cope with the situation. But because we are each different, we each have a unique tipping point. The question is, how we can do this, particularly when the stakes are so high. Psychologists have a term, self-regulation  ways we can keep our stress levels in a zone that enables us to be functional, proactive, agile and resilient. It requires huge self-regulation to contemplate and open our minds to apprehend the edges of these massive issues, said neuroscientist Sarah Peyton, author of Your Resonant Self. This would include climate change, the pandemic, the economy, who we were pre-Covid-19 and who we are now becoming. No wonder people get their fuses blown: being asked to take action, mourn, engage, with something so big. When anxiety or being overwhelmed hits, we can move outside of our window of tolerance. Siegel describes this window as the optimal zone of arousal where we are able to manage and thrive in everyday life, despite the ups and downs. On the one end, when stressed we can go into a rigid response, which may look like despair or depression, or a more chaotic mode of agitation and rage. Often we ricochet between, bouncing around based on how well we can cope with these stressors. There are many things we can do  individually, socially and collectively  to move us into our window of tolerance. We are all doing them every day: walking, playing with our pets, cooking meals, joking around with our friends. We can also try calming practices like deep breathing and meditation known to powerfully change our stress levels. And, what truly helps us all, is our ability to open up, be honest, and have candid, compassionate conversations with those who feel similarly or who are open to listening. Many of us are afraid that well get pulled down into a black hole if we call out pain, guilt and shame that arises when we recognize that we are responsible for some big things going wrong, and that we are now reaping what weve sown. But in fact, its exactly the opposite. Compassionately naming our emotions actively decreases activity in the amygdala, as cognitive scientist Golnaz Tabibnia and her team have discovered in their groundbreaking work. Or what Siegel calls name it to tame it. Each of us need to support this kind of public global climate conversation. And it starts with, of course. Of course you feel sad. Of course you have anxiety and are waking up at night. Of course you are worried about your kids and family. Of course you feel deep concern for all of humanity right now. Of course you feel angry but are not sure why. Of course you are wondering where leadership is. Of course you are grieving for the losses that are happening and will continue. Of course you feel energized to show up as fully as you can. Of course you care. Saying of course to ourselves, first, and to each other as a regular practice, gives us permission to show up as our full, effective selves by first acknowledging the validity, complexity and intensity of the feelings. When leaders, influencers and each of us does this, we are saying, You are not alone. I am here with you. Lets figure this out together. What this looks like in practice  whether in UN meetings, your online conversations, news coverage or a presidential candidate debate stage  is having the courage and bravery to actively acknowledge and affirm what many are feeling but not giving voice to. Of course this is a terrifying moment. These issues seem intractable and overwhelming. Of course its hard to even contemplate. Of course no one wants this to be happening, and everyone wishes it wasnt. The bottom line is that we are all so much more capable of showing up as our most active, hard-working, brilliant, creative, loving and generous selves, when our experience is being part of something bigger than ourselves. That we are not alone  which at this moment we are most certainly, clearly not. When we feel that we matter, our voices and experiences count  no matter how messy or complicated or dark or hopeful. We can all help each other, and our beautiful and suffering planet right now, by starting with saying to one person or a whole cast of thousands, Of course you feel that way. Of course.",23/04/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/23/opinions/climate-crisis-psychology-lertzman/index.html
"To my son, born in the time of coronavirus and climate change","My dearest River, Against all odds you were conceived in a lighthouse, born during a pandemic and will taste just enough of Life as We Knew It to resent us when its gone. Im sorry. Im sorry we broke your sea and your sky and shortened the wings of the nightingale. Im sorry that the Great Barrier Reef is no longer great, that we value AmazonTM more than the Amazon and that the waterfront neighborhood where you burble in my arms could be condemned by rising seas before youre old enough for a mortgage. The scent of your downy crown makes my heart explode. The curl in your Tic Tac toes fills me with enough love to power New York City. If only. Instead, the milk in your bottle was warmed by dirty, ancient fuels and as a result, you will learn to walk on a planet that has never been this hot for humans. We are just now wrestling with the implications of this but as your Pop, the most poignant evidence was seeing your mother give you your first kiss through a P100 mask that smelled faintly of smoke. Im sorry my boy, but we were warned. See, for decades, scientists told us that if we werent careful, humans would unleash an invisible enemy out of the jungle and into our lungs. But that was a story few wanted to believe. So we kept cutting down jungles  and prairies and mangroves and the last few the places where the wild things are  to pave and plow, develop and devour everything inside. As you get older, this will be hard to understand. But we were under the spell of Genesis 1:28: to take dominion over every living thing. We had the strange urge to carve straight lines out of natures curves and were under the spell of a uniquely human force called profit motive. When we finally realized that the worried scientists were right, people got scared and went searching for potions and protections. They emptied store shelves even faster than the jungles and all the invisible enemy masks were gone. Just in time for your birth. Your Mom and I were so scared that I was just about to swallow hard and pay a faceless, soulless internet profiteer $600 for a 50-cent N95 when I remembered the mask I used to protect my lungs from a fiery place called California. It might have saved your Mom from the virus, so I still keep it next to my hurricane waders, malaria pills and the bulletproof vest with the patch that reads PRESS. If I have to pack them and kiss you goodbye more often than youd like, Im sorry. But we were warned. For generations, scientists told us that if we werent careful, a different kind of invisible enemy would come out of our farms, factories, homes and cars, get into the sea and the sky and end Life As We Know It ... but that was a story too few wanted to believe. Including me. But like todays coronavirus, carbon dioxide and methane molecules dont care what we believe. The laws of physics have no regard for how we vote or what we worship. So this will be your first life lesson, little River: We are human and unlike all the other animals, we are made of stories. Our big brains ability to imagine different realities and communicate wild new ideas to our children, neighbors and millions of strangers is what makes us the most powerful force in the known universe. Stories! If the lifespan of our 4.5 billion-year-old planet was scaled down to my age, Homo sapiens showed up about three months ago. The Industrial Revolution began when you started reading this letter and in that blink of Earth time, your species went from cave monkeys to demigods. We rose from bands of insignificant hunter-gatherers at the mercy of nature to city-building, river-bending, mountain-moving masses with weapons and tools that grow mightier by the hour. Along the way, EVERYTHING in our man-made world  flags and borders, money and markets, laws and religions  all of it came from the stories we tell ourselves. Some are older than others. They vary by time and place. And all of them are under constant revision. Take your Grandma Pat. She believed the stories in a very old book with such passion, we followed her dreams from our home in Wisconsin all over the Bible Belt where the heroes were Jesus, cowboys and oilmen. So we burned gasoline for no good reason. We left Prosperity Gospel megachurches, tied a rope to a dirt bike and belly-surfed across a sod farm. We rooster-tailed across Lake Tenkiller on two-stroke Jet Skis and cruised mall parking lots in muscle cars singing The road goes on forever and the party never ends. Turns out that it doesnt, and it does. Im sorry. Meanwhile, every Christmas and summer vacation Id go visit your Grandpa Bill in the mountains of Colorado and as we hiked, paddled and explored, Id hear very different stories with heroes like John Muir, Edward Abbey, Rachel Carson and Eunice Newton Foote. She was an artist and scientist and one day as she filled glass cylinders with different gasses and put them in the garden sun, she discovered that carbon dioxide traps more heat than air. An atmosphere of that gas would give to our Earth a high temperature, she wrote. But in 1856, few paid attention to scientists in skirts. She needed a kind man to present her findings in papers and conventions because, get this, women couldnt even vote (Eunice was also something called a suffragette so she helped change that ridiculous story). Even as plenty of men duplicated her finding, few wanted to think about the dirty secret of fossil fuel because we were too busy burning it to build a rich, glorious and comfortable world. But we were also building an invisible greenhouse in the sky. Thanks to all that heat-trapping gas, our oceans are absorbing as much extra heat as five Hiroshima-sized atomic bombs every SECOND of every day. Since 1961, our planet has lost the equivalent of a block of ice the size of the United States, 16 feet thick. And on Independence Day 2019, 156 years after she put her glass tubes in the garden sun, Anchorage was hotter than Key West. Just like the virus hunters, Eunice Newton Foote was right. Way back when I was cruising the mall in an 80s mullet, big oil companies KNEW she was right and predicted with eerie precision just how screwed we would be. But some stories take a long time to catch on, especially when they challenge everything we think is glorious about being human. Especially when they have to compete with fear, greed and the lies they breed. In the year before you were born, I took a road trip across America. With science as my map, I set out from the Florida Keys to Alaska, from the heartland to burnt Paradise, all to imagine how unnatural disasters will change our future. I met farmers, firefighters and fishermen, politicians, protesters and paleoclimatologists and I came home completely rattled. Because the American Way of Life that I grew up with is already gone. The Goldilocks climate that allowed humanity to thrive is in the past. And nobody seems to know it yet. If we follow the warnings of science and do everything possible to spare your generation maximum pain, it will mean completely new forms of power, food, construction, transportation, economics and politics. It will mean landscapes covered in solar panels, windmills and carbon capture plantations and the kind of intimate relationship with our land and water that went the way of the hunter/gatherer. And if we do nothing? It will mean the end of predictable growing seasons, flight schedules and supply chains, resource wars and tens of millions of climate refugees changing everything we know about borders, neighbors and strangers. And either scenario will bring out both the absolute best and worst in human nature: Hero first responders, innovators and leaders as well as mendacious grifters, conspiracy theorists and tyrants. Theres no telling which side will prevail so its no wonder some believe that bringing you aboard this sinking ship was selfish, immoral and hypocritical. But if we give up on our most primal job we have as humans, havent we already lost? The day I saw your face for the first time, I went from the ultrasound to a climate march led by Greta Thunberg. Youll be able to read volumes on how she was both canonized and demonized but back then she was just a girl the age of your sister, painfully shy when we met with that hand-painted Swedish protest sign tucked under one thin arm. But she was curious enough to digest those warnings from the scientists and honest enough to call out the arrogant ignorance and ignorant arrogance of all the grown-ups in charge. I hope you carry the same superpower because that post-ultrasound march gave me a rare shot of hope. It was walking, breathing, traffic-stopping proof that the story might be changing. So, you will be raised to be engaged. To realize that the strongest societies pull together BEFORE disaster strikes. You will treat believers and deniers with equal empathy, understanding that we are all just products of the stories we are told. And as a tool kit, I promise to fill you with lessons Ive collected from the happiest, healthiest, most resilient societies in the world: Native American fire skills and Dutch water management and secrets from the Blue Zone island in Greece where people forget to die. Youll need every indigenous trick in the book as citizens of the modern world are forced to realize that EVERY DAY is Earth Day. Your Grandma Pat would call you a miracle baby sent from God. Grandpa Bill would chalk you up to a glorious twist of biological fate because we thought we were too old to become new parents. You were the last thing we imagined on a vacation to Croatia, where your Great Grandpa Frank was born and we found a Dubrovnik lighthouse on Airbnb. Until you know what its like to fall in love, the story will make you blush and squirm, but I can think of no better omen for the kind of boy we hope to raise. The lighthouse keeper is vigilant and dependable, with a reverence for natures power and a commitment to saving lives. This is your destiny, my beautiful River. The great thing about stories is that they are always under revision. Now go write a happy ending.",25/04/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/25/weather/climate-change-bill-weir-letter-to-son/index.html
"Billions of people could live in areas too hot for humans by 2070, study says","If the planet continues to warm at current levels over the next 50 years, up to 3 billion people could be living in areas that are too hot for humans, a new study has found. For thousands of years, humans have lived within a narrow climate niche where average temperatures are ideal for society to flourish, and conditions favorable to grow food and keep livestock. In findings published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Monday, an international team of archaeologists, climate scientists and ecologists said that if heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions continue at the current pace, by 2070 billions of people will be living in conditions hotter than those that have allowed life to thrive for the past 6,000 years. For every 1C (1.8F) of warming, 1 billion people will either have to migrate to cooler regions or adapt to extreme heat conditions, the study found. Tim Kohler, an archaeologist at the University of Washington and co-author of the study said that these findings can be viewed as a worst case or business-as-usual scenario of what could happen if we dont change our ways. Using data on historical global temperatures and the distribution of human populations, the researchers found that just like other species of animals, humans thrive best within a narrow climatic envelope around the world. Most of the worlds population live in areas with a mean annual temperature of between 11 and 15 degrees Celsius (51.8 to 59 degrees Fahrenheit). A smaller band of between 20 to 25 C (68 to 77F) encompasses areas in South Asia that are affected by the Indian monsoon  the annual rains that irrigates large swathes of cropland vital for food production. Surprisingly, the scientists said, humans have favored living in these conditions for the past 6,000 years  thats despite recent technological advances such as air conditioning that have allowed us to push this boundary. As an archaeologist I always tell my students that our technology, our minds, and our cumulative culture have enabled us to live anywhere, Kohler said. Thats true of course. But it turns out that there is a distinct climate zone in which our numbers are greatest, and within which we have also been most economically productive. But change could soon be forced upon us. The Earth is currently on track for 3C of warming by 2100. The study suggests that because land areas are warming faster than the oceans, temperatures experienced by humans are likely to rise by about 7.5C by 2070. As our planet rapidly heats up due to rising emissions, the temperature experienced by an average person is projected to change more in the coming decades than it has over the past 6,000 years, the study found. And it could have severe consequences for food production, access to water sources, conflict and disruption caused by migration. Its reasonable to conclude that if something has been reasonably stable for 6000 years, were not going to change it painlessly or quickly, Kohler said. Among the hottest places on Earth is the Sahara region of Africa, which experiences annual mean temperatures above 29C (84.2F). These extreme conditions cover 0.8% of the earths land area. However, researchers said that those extreme heat areas are expected to spread to 19% of the Earths surface, affecting 3.5 billion people by 2070. Regions that stand to be affected include parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, South America, India, Southeast Asia, Arabian Peninsula and Australia  regions with fast-growing populations, said Chi Xu, from Nanjing Universitys School of Life Sciences, and another co-author of the report. Those countries are mostly in global south, with the fastest population growing rate, such as India and Nigeria. These two countries are projected to accommodate the largest populations under extreme temperature conditions, Chi said. The studys projection of 3.5 billion possible climate migrants goes far beyond the World Bank estimates, which suggested 143 million people across South Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America were at risk of being displaced. Its a dire warning of what could happen if the climate crisis is left unchecked. But there is hope. The scientists said that by rapidly and substantially reducing global carbon emissions, the number of people exposed to brutally hot conditions could be halved. The authors explain that there are a number of uncertainties with how the climate crisis will fuel displacement and to what extent, and said the study cant be used as a prediction of migration. The figures are also based on worst case projections and there are questions over how actions to mitigate against climate change, including political developments, institutional changes, and socioeconomic conditions may affect these outcomes. The worst case scenario can be largely avoided if effective cut of greenhouse gas emissions is achieved, Chi said. Many effective measures of climate mitigation and local adaptation would help to alleviate the negative influence of climate change on human societies.",05/05/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/05/world/global-warming-climate-niche-temperatures-intl-hnk/index.html
Snow is turning green in Antarctica ?and climate change will make it worse,"Green snow created by blooming algae in the Antarctic Peninsula is likely to spread as temperatures increase as a result of climate change, researchers have said, after creating the first large-scale map of the organisms and their movements. Satellite data gathered between 2017 and 2019, combined with on-the-ground measurements over two summers in Antarctica, allowed scientists to map the microscopic algae as they bloomed across the snow of the Antarctic Peninsula. Warming temperatures could create more habitable environments for the algae, which need wet snow to grow in, researchers told CNN. Green snow alga is microscopic when measured individually, but when the organisms grow simultaneously, they turn the snow bright green, and can even be spotted from space, researchers said in a study published in the Nature Communications journal on Wednesday. Researchers from the University of Cambridge and the British Antarctic Survey used European Space Agency satellite data with measurements from Antarcticas Ryder Bay, Adelaide Island, the Fildes Peninsula and King George Island. Patches of green snow algae can be found along the Antarctic coastline, usually in warmer areas, where average temperatures are a little above zero degrees Celsius during the Southern Hemispheres summer months of November to February. The Antarctic Peninsula is the part of the region that has experienced the most rapid warming in the latter part of the last century, researchers say. Unusually high temperatures were recorded in February, while a nine-day heatwave scorched the continents northern tip earlier this year. Scientists identified 1,679 separate blooms of green algae on the snow surface, covering an area of 1.9 km2  which equates to a carbon sink of around 479 tons per year. A carbon sink is a reservoir that absorbs more carbon than it releases. Researchers believe the organisms will expand as global temperatures increase. As Antarctica warms, we predict the overall mass of snow algae will increase, as the spread to higher ground will significantly outweigh the loss of small island patches of algae, Dr Andrew Gray, lead author of the paper, and a researcher at the University of Cambridge, said in a statement. He told CNN that rising temperatures would create more habitable environments for the algae. However, while an increase in snow melt could lead to more algae growing, Gray told CNN that the distribution of the organisms is heavily linked to bird populations, whose excrement acts as a fertilizer to accelerate growth. As bird  particularly penguin  populations are affected by warming temperatures, the snow algae could lose sources of nutrients to grow, he said. An increase in the blooms could also lead to further snow melt, he said. Its very dark  a green snow algal bloom will reflect about 45% of light hitting it whereas fresh snow will reflect about 80% of the light hitting it, so it will increase the rate of snow melt in a localized area, he explained. Researchers found that almost two thirds of the blooms were on small, low lying islands, and said that as the Antarctic Peninsula warms due to rising global temperatures, these islands could lose their summer snow cover and algae  although in terms of mass the majority of snow algae is found in areas where they can spread to higher ground when snow melts.",21/05/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/21/world/green-snow-antarctica-climate-change-intl-scli-scn/index.html
New Jersey is the first state to add climate change to its K-12 education standards,"New Jersey students will start learning about climate change in kindergarten and keep studying the crisis through graduation under the states new education standards. The State Board of Education adopted the new guidelines on Wednesday which outline what will be taught to New Jerseys 1.4 million students. Its the first state to include climate change education in its K-12 learning standards, officials said in a statement. New Jerseys first lady Tammy Murphy pushed for the new standards and met with 130 educators statewide. She said New Jersey is already dealing with problems caused by climate change, including disappearing shorelines, algae blooms, super storms and hot summers. This generation of students will feel the effects of climate change more than any other, and it is critical that every student is provided an opportunity to study and understand the climate crisis through a comprehensive, interdisciplinary lens, she said in a statement. Young people, including teen activist Greta Thunberg, have been at the forefront of recent climate change protests and students in more than 100 countries staged walkouts last year. The new standards, which will go into effect in 2021 and 2022, cover seven subject areas  21st Century Life and Careers, Comprehensive Health and Physical Education, Science, Social Studies, Technology, Visual and Performing Arts, and World Languages. The Mathematics and Language Arts guidelines arent up for review until 2022, but the board added climate change standards as an appendix to those subjects. Former Vice President Al Gore praised the move. I am incredibly proud that New Jersey is the first state in the nation to fully integrate climate education in their K-12 curricula, Gore said in a statement. This initiative is vitally important to our students as they are the leaders of tomorrow, and we will depend on their leadership and knowledge to combat this crisis. Gov. Phil Murphy has made fighting climate change a key part of his agenda and has called for the state to use 100% clean energy by 2050.",04/06/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/04/us/new-jersey-climate-schools-scn-trnd/index.html
"Beavers are gnawing away at the Arctic permafrost, and that? bad for the planet","The beaver may be an unlikely agent of climate change, but the cuddly-looking creatures are transforming the Arctic landscape in a way that could be exacerbating global warming, a new study has suggested. With their sharp teeth, beavers fell trees and shrubs and build dams, which flood small valleys and form new lakes that can cover several hectares of land. These new water bodies contribute to the thawing of the frozen permafrost soil, which is a huge natural reservoir of methane  a potent greenhouse gas. Scientists are concerned that as the permafrost degrades, the climate-changing methane and carbon leak into the atmosphere. In the past few years, scientists have spotted beavers in the Alaskan tundra where theyve previously never been seen before  and the animals have been enjoying a dam-building boom in their new neighborhood, according to the study of high-resolution satellite imagery published in the journal Environmental Research Letters Monday. They also seem to be building their dams and creating new lakes in the very locations that are most likely to intensify the thawing of the permafrost. Were seeing exponential growth there. The number of these structures doubles roughly every four years, said Ingmar Nitze, a researcher from the Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research in Potsdam, Germany, and author of the study. Their methods are extremely effective. The study found that the number of beaver dams in a 100-square-kilometer area surrounding the city of Kotzebue, northwest Alaska, increased from just two in 2002 to 98 in 2019  a 5,000% increase. Beaver dams in the larger, 430-square-kilometer area on Alaskas Baldwin Peninsula have increased from 94 in 2010 to 174 in 2013 and 409 last year. Its possible to see them and spot them (the dams) in the imagery. Its also possible to see the development of lakes. They had a distinctive signal, said Nitze. Several different factors explain why the beavers have occupied a region they wouldnt normally call home, said Nitze. One is climate change, which is altering the typically treeless tundra. We see an increase in vegetation. There are more shrubs coming in there so all the stuff beavers need to build their dams, or as food, is there, he said. Furthermore, the lakes, which used to freeze solid, now offer friendlier conditions for beavers, as a result of their thinner seasonal winter ice cover The tundra is also not the beavers usual habitat so they face no predators or competition for resources, plus the animals are better protected now by US federal law and hunted far less by humans than they used to be. Because the lakes the beavers create contain water that is warmer than the surrounding soil, the new bodies of water accelerate the permafrost thawing. The thing about permafrost is that water interacts very strongly with the frozen ground beneath it, Nitze said. The more surface water you have, the worse it is for the permafrostbecause in the winter the cold air cannot penetrate again into the ground, and the water stores a lot of the heat and can even penetrate it into the ground, he said. Lakes and water bodies influenced by beavers accounted for two-thirds of the 8.3% increase in total surface water area in the Kotzebue study area during a 17-year period, the study found. The beavers also seemed to intuitively target drained lake basins, turbocharging the impact they had on the landscape and the permafrost. Its a special landscape. Theres typically a lot of lakes but they are dynamic so they can drain and leave a lot of basins ... and these beavers are smart enough to block the outlet and refill the basin again. They dam up a lot of area with minimum effort. Nitze said the beaver dam-building boom was also likely taking place in the Canadian tundra, and could also be happening in Siberia. Were working to expand the analysis on a bigger scale. Some climate scientists think that we are underestimating the warming effect of the thawing permafrost. There are a lot of people trying to quantify methane and CO2 emissions from lakes in the Arctic but not specifically yet from beaver lakes, said Nitze. Its a very new topic and something we have uncovered over the past few years. Beavers can have a quite significant impact on these landscapes, so theres no real quantification yet for these lakes but it will be done in the future.",29/06/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/29/americas/beavers-arctic-scn-climate-change-trnd/index.html
Warning: The world won? hit climate goals unless energy innovation is rapidly accelerated,"Solar and wind power are booming. Electric vehicles are so promising that Tesla is now worth more than ExxonMobil. Coal is collapsing. And yet energy watchdogs are warning that not nearly enough is being done to fight the climate crisis. The International Energy Agency sounded the alarm Thursday about the critical need to rapidly accelerate clean energy innovation. Thats because the climate goals set by governments and corporations around the world depend on technologies that have not yet reached the market. The message is very clear: in the absence of much faster clean energy innovation, achieving net-zero goals in 2050 will be all but impossible, Fatih Birol, the IEAs executive director, said in a statement. Major parts of the world economy dont have clean energy options as yet. Power companies are dumping coal in favor of increasingly affordable solar and wind power. And all the major auto makers are racing to develop the best electric vehicles to compete with Tesla. Yet there are few technologies available to bring emissions down to zero in areas such as shipping, trucking and aviation, the IEA said. The same problem exists in heavy industries like steel, cement and chemicals. Decarbonizing these sectors will largely require the development of new technologies that are not currently in commercial use, the report said. And that is no slam dunk. It took decades to scale up solar panels and batteries to make them economical. And plenty of technologies failed along the way. Time is in even shorter supply now, the IEA report said. Thats not to say progress isnt being made. Late last year, Heliogen, a clean energy startup backed by Bill Gates, discovered a way to use artificial intelligence and a field of mirrors to generate extreme amounts of heat from the sun. The goal is to use that carbon-free sunlight to replace fossil fuels in certain heavy pollution industrial processes, such as making cement, glass and steel. Still, the IEA said there are no single or simple solutions to putting the world on a sustainable path to net-zero emissions. About three-quarters of the cumulative reductions in carbon emissions to get on that path will need to come from technologies that have not yet reached full maturity, the report said. For instance, while battery technology has evolved significantly, the IEA said rapid progress is required to transition battery prototypes to the worlds long-distance transportation needs. Yet there isnt enough money being deployed by corporations or the public sector toward researching next-generation energy solutions. There is a disconnect between the climate goals that governments and companies have set for themselves and the efforts underway to develop better and cheaper technologies to realize those goals, the IEAs Birol said. That disconnect, like so many others now, is being amplified by the pandemic. Although social distancing and health restrictions are causing carbon emissions to tumble, investment in energy is also falling sharply. Spending in the energy industry is expected to plunge by a record $400 billion, or 20%, this year, the IEA previously estimated. That slowdown in spending undermines efforts to develop clean energy solutions. At the same time, questions about the future of the economy, especially the energy and transportation sectors, will make it harder for startups to attract capital. Governments grappling with dual health and economic crises may be tempted to divert money away from developing clean energy at exactly the wrong time. Failure to accelerate progress now, the IEA report said, risks pushing the transition to net-zero emissions further into the future.",02/07/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/02/business/climate-change-clean-energy-iea/index.html
"Warming temperatures threaten hundreds of fish species the world relies on, study finds","As the planets oceans and rivers warm, increased heat could pose a grave threat to the fish populations the world depends on by the end of this century. Thats the alarming conclusion of a new study published Thursday in the journal Science. Among the species the authors said are at risk are some of the most commercially important species on Earth  including grocery store staples like Atlantic cod, Alaska pollock and sockeye salmon, and sport fishing favorites like swordfish, barracuda and brown trout. In fact, 60% of the fish species examined could struggle to reproduce in their current habitat ranges by the year 2100 if the climate crisis continues unchecked, according to the researchers. If governments recommit themselves to holding global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, however, the scientists found the number of species threatened could be far less  just 10%. More than half of the species potentially at risk is quite astonishing, so we really emphasize that its important to take action and follow the political commitments to reduce climate change and protect marine habitats, said Dr. Flemming Dahlke, a marine biologist at Germanys Alfred Wegener Institute and one of the authors of the study. That worst-case scenario of global warmings impact on fish species is yet more evidence showing that without sweeping efforts to cut emissions of heat-trapping gases, human activity threatens to permanently disrupt the ecosystems that feed billions of people. The study was conducted by a team of researchers based in Germany, who analyzed temperature tolerance data for nearly 700 species of marine and freshwater fish from climate zones around the world. Past studies of fish sensitivity to changing water temperatures have focused mostly on adult fish. But to really understand how warmer waters will impact species, the researchers argued that its essential to look at the most vulnerable stages in a fishs life cycle  those that are critical to reproduction and species survival. In nearly all cases, fish embryos and spawners  female and male fish that are preparing to produce eggs and sperm  are far more vulnerable to abnormally warm water temperatures than adults and larvae, the researchers found. Theres a difference in the tolerable temperature range of almost 20 degrees on average between embryos and adults, Dahlke said. This of course makes a big difference when you want to look at the sensitivity of species to global warming. The consequences for humans could be enormous. Today, an estimated 3 billion people rely on fish and seafood as their primary source of protein. To survive, many species would be forced to evolve to cope with warmer temperatures or to move in search of cooler waters, the authors said. But given the speed with which human activity is warming the planet, many species may not be able to adapt fast enough to survive. If climate change continues unchecked, we will probably see big changes in the species composition of our ecosystems, Dahlke said. When species can no longer reproduce in their traditional habitats, they have to either go into deeper water or further North if possible, or become locally extinct if theyre unable to do that. As the planet heats up, several other recent studies have shown how oceans in particular have borne the brunt of the warming. Its virtually certain that the worlds oceans have warmed nonstop since 1970 and have absorbed 90 percent of the planets excess heat, according to a landmark report last fall from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. And the worlds oceans are now heating at the same rate as if five Hiroshima atomic bombs were dropped into the water every second, found another study from January. There is also evidence that heat is already reshaping aquatic ecosystems. An April study published in the scientific journal Nature found that recent marine heat waves  characterized by extreme water temperatures that persist over huge areas of the ocean  have led to fish die-offs and dramatically shifted the ranges of many species. These recent marine heat waves have offered a glimpse into how species may respond if water temperatures continue to climb, Dahlke said. The effects of these heat waves kind of forecasts what could happen at the end of this century. This latest study strengthens the evidence sounding an alarm for government leaders to take meaningful action to protect fish species that people depend on.",02/07/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/02/weather/fish-vulnerable-ocean-warming-climate-change-scn/index.html
Global temperatures could exceed crucial 1.5 C target in the next five years,"There is an increasing chance that annual global temperatures could exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels over the next five years, new climate predictions from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) say. Under the 2015 Paris climate accord, countries committed to reduce their carbon output and halt global warming below 2 degrees Celsius  and if possible, below 1.5 degrees Celsius  by the end of the century to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. But according to the WMO report, there is around a 20% chance that one of the next five years will be at least 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial levels, with the chance increasing with time. Annual global temperature is likely to be at least 1 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial levels, and the last five years has been the warmest on record, the assessment  based on modeling and the expertise of climate scientists  found. In 2020, the Arctic is likely to have warmed by more than twice the global mean, and many parts of South America, southern Africa and Australia are likely to be dryer than in the recent past, the WMO said. There is a 70% chance that one or more months during the next five years will be at least 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial levels, the WMO assessment said. In the coming five years, almost all regions are likely to be warmer than the recent past, scientists warned. Over 2020-2024, eastern parts of South America are likely to be dryer, high latitude regions and the Sahel are likely to be wetter, and the northern North Atlantic region could have stronger westerly winds, which could lead to more storms in western Europe. This study shows  with a high level of scientific skill  the enormous challenge ahead in meeting the Paris Agreement on Climate Change target of keeping a global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius, WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said in a statement. The forecast takes into account natural variations as well as human influence on the climate, but does not take into consideration the changes in greenhouse gas emissions as a result of Covid-19 lockdowns across the globe. Due to the very long lifetime of CO2 in the atmosphere, the impact of the drop in emissions this year is not expected to lead to a reduction of CO2 atmospheric concentrations which are driving global temperature increases, Taalas said. WMO has repeatedly stressed that the industrial and economic slowdown from Covid-19 is not a substitute for sustained and coordinated climate action. He acknowledged the international health and economic crisis brought about by the pandemic, but said a failure to tackle climate change may threaten human well-being, ecosystems and economies for centuries. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded in a landmark report that we only have until 2030 to drastically reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and prevent the planet from reaching the crucial threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Experts have repeatedly warned that exceeding the threshold will contribute to more heatwaves and hot summers, greater sea level rise, worse droughts and rainfall extremes, wildfires, floods and food shortages for millions of people.",09/07/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/09/world/global-temperatures-wmo-climate-intl-scli/index.html
"Siberian heatwave made 600 times more likely by climate change, experts find","The prolonged heatwave in Siberia from January to June, which pushed overall temperatures 5 degrees Celsius (9 degrees Fahrenheit) higher than normal, would have been almost impossible if not for human-caused climate change, a new study has found. Temperatures in Siberia have been above average since the beginning of the year, with the Russian town of Verkhoyansk recording a temperature of 38 degrees C (100.4 degrees Fahrenheit) in June  a record temperature for the Arctic. The heat in the vast Russian region triggered widespread wildfires in June, associated with an estimated 56 million tons of carbon dioxide  more than the annual emissions of some industrialized nations like Switzerland and Norway. The heat in Siberia has also accelerated the melting of permafrost. An oil tank built on the frozen soil collapsed in May, leading to one of the worst oil spills ever in the region. In a rapid attribution study released Wednesday, a team of international researchers found that the prolonged heat like the Arctic region experienced this year would only happen less than once in every 80,000 years without human-induced climate change. This, researchers said, would make such an event almost impossible in a climate that had not been warmed by greenhouse gas emissions. Scientists found that climate change increased the chances of prolonged heat by a factor of at least 600, and warned that greenhouse gases released by the fires and melting permafrost will further heat the planet, and decrease the planets reflectivity from loss of snow and ice. The Siberian heatwave has also contributed to dropping levels of sea ice, especially in the Arctic Ocean, according to the US National Snow and Ice Data Center. The heat has also been associated with an outbreak of silk moths, whose larvae eat conifer trees in the region, according to the Met Office. Siberia experienced its warmest June on record  up to 10 degrees Celsius (18 degrees Fahrenheit) higher than average according to the Copernicus Climate Change Service, a program affiliated with the European Commission. The region tends to experience large swings in temperature month-to-month and year-to-year. But temperatures in the region have stayed well above average since 2019, which is unusual. The findings of this rapid research  that climate change increased the chances of the prolonged heat in Siberia by at least 600 times  are truly staggering, Andrew Ciavarella, lead author of the research and senior detection and attribution scientist at the Met Office, said in a statement. This research is further evidence of the extreme temperatures we can expect to see more frequently around the world in a warming global climate. Importantly, an increasing frequency of these extreme heat events can be moderated by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, he added. The scientists said that, even in the current climate, the prolonged heat was still unlikely, with such extreme conditions being expected to occur less than once every 130 years. However, without rapid cuts in greenhouse gas emissions they risk becoming frequent by the end of the century, experts warned. This story has been updated to correct a conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit.",16/07/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/16/world/siberia-heatwave-climate-change-intl-scli-scn/index.html
This camera could let us see climate change in a new way,"When you hear people  presidential candidates, policy wonks, scientists, whomever  talk about the climate crisis, youre sure to get an earful of dates. Eliminate fossil fuel pollution by 2050. Cut emissions in half by 2030. Expect sea level rise perhaps a meter or so by 2100 (or more than that in worst-case scenarios). Those years  2030, 2050, 2100  can seem a way-off future, beyond the gravity of this-second news cycles. Who actually imagines, as part of daily life, what the year 2100 will look like? Were just trying to get through the US election cycle this year  or through the coronavirus pandemic. We view the world through a right-now lens. The artist and philosopher Jonathon Keats, however, finds daily, yearly and even decadal timeframes to be incredibly myopic. To try to get us to think outside our own time, Keats has developed a Millennium Camera that now is taking a 1,000-year exposure of Lake Tahoe in California. Keats has installed two other thousand-year cameras, one in Massachusetts and another in Arizona. More are in the works. The aim of this long-duration photography is to trigger new thinking about the planetary crisis thats caused by humanitys inability to stop burning fossil fuels and chopping down forests. The Millennium Camera is of the pinhole variety. It contains an oil paint that bleaches slightly over time, capturing a time-lapse image of the landscape, which can be expected to shift  perhaps becoming more arid  beneath the forces of global warming. If the landscape changes over time, the photographic plate will show multiple overlapping scenes or the motion blur of a scene that gradually morphs, Keats told me. Its like a whole movie compressed into a single frame. The images from each camera wont be ready until the 31st Century. Yep, 3020-ish. In geological terms, thats practically next week, he said. In climate change terms, thats true, as well. Not that we usually think of it that way. Pretty much all of the warming that weve seen will persist for 1,000 years, said Kirsten Zickfeld, an associate professor of geography at Simon Fraser University, who thinks about the year 3000 way more than most of us (which, outside sci-fi, is probably never). Almost none of the warming were experiencing today will have vanished. The reason? Something like 40% to 50% of the carbon dioxide were pumping into the atmosphere now will still be traveling through atmospheric and oceanic systems in the year 3000, Zickfeld said, ensuring that temperatures remain elevated and sea level rise continues to accelerate. The carbon thats junking up the atmosphere will last even longer than that  perhaps 10,000 years, she said  if we really keep polluting at out-of-control rates. Imagining that the decisions that we made in the past and that we make today will affect Earth and life on Earth for such a long period of time  its mind boggling, Zickfeld told me. Knowing todays pollution lasts at least 1,000 years is potentially paralyzing news. But look at the inverse: If and when we decide to end the fossil fuel era, stopping the pollution thats heating up the Earth, those actions will matter for a millennium, too. Our actions reverberate for thousands of years  at least! Those of us who tell the story of the climate crisis rarely acknowledge that timescale. Maybe thats just as well, Zickfeld told me, because, from a policy perspective, we really do need to reach net-zero carbon emissions in the next few decades to have even the slightest glimmer of hope of meeting international targets set in the Paris Agreement. In other words, there truly is such an extreme urgency to the now-now, the next-10-years now, that a person could be forgiven for not engaging in 1,000-year thought experiments. But this is only part of the picture. Because without recognizing the intra-millennial consequences of our today-actions, well fail to see the urgency of this moment. I believe thats already happening. Activists love to say that the climate crisis is extremely urgent and fast-moving  that momentum for change is building like never before. I want this to be true. While it is true that we are able to see evidence of massive changes all around us  fires, droughts, storms and so on  this crisis is happening more slowly than our own human psychology can perceive. Academics call this shifting baseline syndrome or generational amnesia  the idea that environmental change is happening slowly enough that we dont see it (or dont live long enough to see it). And we therefore unknowingly accept an increasingly degraded and dangerous planet as normal. Our very conception of normal shifts forward with us through time. We may always feel a little freaked out, but we rarely or never consciously see the scope of change. One example: Frances C. Moore, an assistant professor at the University of California, Davis, analyzed tweets about the weather and found that we only access a memory bank thats about two to eight years long when we decide whether today is hot. That memory shifts forward with us through time, creating the prospect that the Earth will always feel about as hot as it does right now, even as temperatures increase dramatically. My documentary series, BASELINE, which is revisiting four communities on the frontlines of the climate crisis every five years, until 2050, is one attempt to make sense of the magnitude of change that is getting right past the alarm systems in our brains. Keats 1,000-year camera is another take. He aims to show the climate crisis on its own timescale, not ours. Will it work? Well ... Although Ive taken great care to make these cameras as durable and functional as possible, I think its highly unlikely that any will survive the next millennium of wear and tear, he said. And even if a camera is still intact after 1,000 years, and somebody recovers it, I think its unlikely that the image will be properly exposed. Still, thats beside the point, and Keats knows it. Hes not creating 1,000-year images for future people, not really. Hes making them for us. To connect us to that future. And to help us realize that were already living it.",17/07/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/17/opinions/millennium-camera-keats-sutter/index.html
"Most polar bears could struggle to survive in the Arctic by 2100, study finds","For many people, there is one animal that comes to mind when they think of creatures threatened by climate change: the polar bear. In recent years, images of emaciated bears searching desperately for food have made the Arctics apex predator the poster child for the effects of global warming. Now, as the planet continues to warm rapidly, a new study brings another dire warning: If humans fail to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, most populations of the iconic species could struggle to survive beyond 2100. Already, some populations have likely crossed key thresholds that will make their survival difficult, and perhaps impossible, according to the findings of the study published Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change. However, there is a glimmer of hope that some bears can be saved. Though the number of polar bears is likely to be greatly reduced in some regions, moderate cuts to heat-trapping gas emissions in the coming decades could allow them to persist in a few pockets of the Arctic. Polar bears are the largest terrestrial carnivores on Earth, but their fate is intimately tied to what happens to the Arctics sea ice. They rely on the ice as a platform to catch seals  their prey of choice  because they are not skilled enough swimmers to catch them in the open water, says Peter K. Molnar, an assistant professor at the University of Toronto Scarborough and one of the authors of the study. The life of a polar bear has always been characterized by periods of feast and famine. In winter, when the sea ice is at its greatest extent, the bears try to gorge themselves on seals to build up energy stores to survive the lean summer months, when the ice melts and they are forced onto land. But as the regions sea ice declines as it has in recent decades, bear populations in some parts of the Arctic are being forced to go longer and longer without food. Ultimately, the bears need food and in order to have food, they need ice, said Molnar. But in order for them to have ice, we need to control climate change. Figuring out how long bears in different regions can fast before reproduction and adult survival are impaired was the researchers first challenge. The study found that the length of time a bear can survive without food varies by region and the condition of the bear, but that cubs are the first to be impacted by a lengthy fast. Adult females with cubs are generally the second-most vulnerable, followed by adult males and finally, solitary females, some of which can fast for a staggering 255 days before their chances of survival decline steeply, the researchers estimate. Next, the researchers looked at projections for Arctic sea ice under two different climate change scenarios to see how long the bears could be forced to go without food in the future. The Arctics sea ice has shrunk dramatically in recent decades, particularly during summer. The last 13 years from 2007 to 2019 have been the lowest 13 years for summer sea ice in the satellite record, which dates back to 1979, according to Walt Meier, a senior research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center. Since the mid-1990s, the Arctic has experienced levels of warming that are more than double the global average. Exceptionally high air temperatures are behind the Arctics declining sea ice and are being driven mainly by people burning fossil fuels, Meier says. Looking into the future, other studies have found that the Arctic could be ice-free in summer as soon as 2040 or 2050. The question is not if well see an ice-free summer in the Arctic  its when, Meier said. By combining their estimates for how long polar bears can fast with Arctic sea ice projections, the researchers were able to estimate for the first time when polar bears in 13 different regions could face trouble in the future. Some populations, like those in Canadas Hudson Bay, may have already crossed thresholds that will impact reproduction and survival. And the future will likely look far worse for the bears without efforts to curb global warming. Under a business as usual climate scenario, where humans fail to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, nearly all polar bears in the Arctic  outside of perhaps a few groups in Canadas remote Queen Elizabeth Islands  may struggle to survive by 2100, the study found. However, if humans are able to muster moderate cuts to global emissions, the chances that bears in other regions will persist beyond the end of this century increase. The authors say that ultimately, these findings show that the fate of polar bears lies in our hands. Im well aware that the story were telling is a grim one, Molnar said. But there is also an element of hope that they are not completely doomed if we change our behavior.",20/07/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/20/weather/polar-bears-survival-threatened-arctic-climate-change/index.html
Apple plans to be totally carbon neutral by 2030,"Apple made a major commitment to fighting climate change Tuesday, announcing plans to be entirely carbon neutral by 2030. The pledge would cover its entire business, including its supply chain, manufacturing process, and the life of its products. An iPhone bought in 2030 will have net zero climate impact, including the energy a consumer uses to power the device, according to Apple. Apple plans to achieve this by minimizing carbon in its products, using efficient and renewable energy, using different materials and removing carbon from the atmosphere, the company said. This is a moment not to move away from the great challenge of climate change, Lisa Jackson, Apple vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, told CNN Business. We wanted to step up and show we should all move even faster if we can because the situation is urgent and continuing to be more urgent. Companies, including Apple competitors like Amazon, have increasingly made changes to go carbon neutral in the coming decades. But companies can sidestep climate impacts by outsourcing the dirty work to other companies. A company might buy steel rather than manufacturing it, given the related emissions. Nives Dolsak, a University of Washington professor who studies climate change, said the trend of businesses making carbon neutrality pledges is a positive. But shes also been critical of Amazons pledge, for example, and what emissions the company counts. Its not enough to say here are the targets and we are going to reduce emissions, Dolsak told CNN Business. Apple (AAPL) says it has commitments from over 70 suppliers to use 100% renewable energy for Apple (AAPL) production. Jackson said the company hopes the announcement will rally more suppliers to work with it to limit their carbon footprint. Apple (AAPL) is also working with the US-China Green Fund to invest $100 million in energy efficiency projects for its suppliers. Apple is already starting to change the materials it works with. The company said Tuesday that its begun to use a new type of aluminum to make its 16-inch MacBook Pros. No carbon is used when the aluminum is smelted, according to Apple. Apple has also reduced emissions from gases used in manufacturing its electronics. The company said it has a new robot thats designed to disassemble an iPhone component that contains valuable rare earth elements, which can be reused in future devices. According to Apple, all iPhones, iPads, Macs and Apple Watches released in the last year now have recycled rare earth elements. Its also working with the environmental non-profit Conservation International on projects such as restoring a mangrove ecosystem in Columbia as well as a degraded savanna in Kenya. These efforts, and other carbon capture projects, would offset the carbon footprint of using Apple products, the company said. But Dolsak cautioned that companies must share emission data so that scientists and non-profit organizations can review data and comment on the reliability of reporting methods. Apple makes annual reports, the company said, to the CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), a non-profit organization that releases environmental disclosures for businesses.",21/07/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/21/tech/apple-climate-change/index.html
Explorer? mission to photograph a century of climate change in Patagonia,"Chilean explorer and photographer, Cristian Donoso, has spent over two decades traversing the wilds of Patagonia, Antarctica and the Arctic to capture images showing the impacts of climate change. Donosos exploration career began in 1996 in the rugged mountains, towering glaciers and windswept fjords of Patagonia, where the challenge to survive gave him a profound love of the landscape. When you are on an expedition you must connect strongly with nature, open your senses to the fullest, because your survival depends on it, he says. And in that survival, you are deeply aware of the natural world, you marvel, and your soul tells you that this is extraordinary. An award-winning navigator, mountaineer and filmmaker, Donoso has mounted more than 50 expeditions to some of the most remote and untouched places on Earth. He minimizes the carbon emissions and environmental impact of his trips by using human and wind-powered forms of travel including sailboat, kayak and skis. In January, Donoso embarked on Forgotten Footsteps, an expedition retracing the journey of early 20th century explorer and artist Rockwell Kent in Tierra del Fuego, Patagonia. The Americans paintings of the regions snow-capped mountains and majestic glaciers contrast starkly with Donosos images of the same landscapes today, where global warming has dramatically altered the icy peaks and fjords. Patagonias ice fields, which stretch across the Andean mountains for hundreds of miles through Chile and Argentina, make up the largest body of ice in the southern hemisphere, outside of Antarctica. According to NASA, they are melting fast, contributing to rising sea levels. Find out about more about Call to Earth and the extraordinary people working for a more sustainable future. In 2018, Donosos series Ice Postcards took him to some of Patagonias least accessible places. He followed in the footsteps of pioneering Italian missionary Alberto de Agostini  a prolific explorer who documented the glaciers of the Cordillera Darwin (a mountain range named after British biologist Charles Darwin) in Tierra del Fuego, over a century ago. De Agostinis archive contains over 11,000 photographs of Patagonia. Donoso and expedition partner Alfredo Pourailly tracked down the exact locations of 10 of de Agostinis images and replicated them at the same time of year in order to capture the same seasonal conditions. They chose images of especially remote places that very few people would have visited since de Agostinis expeditions. What they found was beyond their worst fears. It was much more dramatic than what we believed would be the case, says Donoso. Donosos 2018 image of the Marinelli glacier shows the ice has receded more than six miles (10 kilometers) since de Agostini took the same photograph, at the same time of year, in 1914. Places that we have yet to really understand, that we havent explored, that we havent photographed or that we have yet to chart have been profoundly impacted by humans, says Donoso. The world is a much smaller place than we think. Donoso says the achievement of accessing remote places with minimal means makes him feel free and immensely happy. These trips are grueling feats of physical endurance but they spark a deep spiritual communion with nature. Everything in our physical and cognitive conformation has been determined by our contact with nature, Donoso says. Returning to it allows us ... to discover who we really are. The jutting shelf of ice of the Negri glacier terminus, captured by de Agostini in 1913, has been replaced by vegetation. Donoso says that he shares the same passion as the 19th and 20th century naturalists who have inspired his work. But the world he studies looks very different. His aim is to engage and educate people about the impact of global warming in faraway places. Through art, through the vision of photography, we offer a clearer perspective, with a very direct and sensitive message, he says. The message from Ice Postcards seems clear  the Patagonian ice sheets are melting at an alarming rate. Donoso and Pourailly aim to complete the second part of the project later this year. Donoso hopes that by revealing the destruction wrought by climate change in remote parts of the world, he can catalyze change. No one will fight to protect things that they arent aware of, he says.",05/08/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/04/americas/cristian-donoso-patagonia-climate-change-spc-c2e-intl-scn/index.html
5 lessons from the pandemic to tackle the climate crisis,"Our enemies seem so tiny. One is a virus unleashed from the wilderness, likely by people with mouths to feed and spread by others with planes to catch. The second enemy is a molecule of heat-trapping gas  methane and CO2  unleashed by people with mouths to feed and planes to catch. But rising body counts and shattered economies prove that some of the smallest ingredients found in nature can explode into global emergencies thanks to human nature. In the wars against coronavirus and the climate crisis, we have met the enemy and the enemy is us. Such is is the sentiment of virologists and climatologists alike as they point out how much the pandemic can teach us about the fight for the survival of life on Earth. The danger of ignoring science is the top lesson from Michael Mann, director of Penn States Earth System Science Center. By rejecting what the leading health scientists were telling us, the current administrations policies of inaction on Covid-19 have needlessly already cost us more than 100,000 lives, he said. As the co-author of the famous hockey stick graph, Mann was among the first to confirm how levels of heat-trapping pollution have jumped with the burning of fossil fuels. As a result, hes endured years of accusations, lawsuits and death threats  even as his work was repeatedly confirmed by other scientists. He sees a kindred spirit in Dr. Anthony Fauci, now facing similar attacks for simply speaking scientific truth to power. If there is a silver lining, it is that the failure of the current administration to respond meaningfully to the pandemic lays bare the deadliness of ideologically motivated science denial, Mann said. This applies to the even greater crisis of human-caused climate change and the need to treat it as the emergency it is. In March, a group of governors joined a White House conference call, desperate for federal help in finding ventilators and PPE for their overflowing hospital ICUs. Try getting it yourselves, Donald Trump replied. Those words not only squandered the unique power of the presidency to focus the nations makers on a single mission, they also created the kind of frantic bidding wars between American states that can lead to corruption and waste. Suddenly, a grandmothers life depended on the bargaining skills of a mayor or community health administrator. The same dynamic is bound to play out as seas rise, mountains burn and economies shift. So until a vaccine  or a decarbonized economy  is discovered, the wisdom of neighbors, mayors and Main Streets could mean the difference between life and death. Social distancing and mask-wearing have taught us that the personal decision can save  or cost  human lives. But to fully eradicate Covid-19 on a planet of over 7 billion, your mask and clean hands wont cut it. Likewise, shrinking your own carbon footprint is vital  and healthy  but humanity wont zero out carbon OR cure Covid-19 without massive efforts by every sector of every society around the world. Both individual behavior change and systemic change are critical to addressing a global crisis, Mann said. We need dramatic systemic changes in the form of polices that will help us decarbonize our economy quickly. Billions of people have changed the way they live so far this year. But changes only matter if they last. Temporarily, the pandemic reduced the emissions of the worlds biggest carbon polluters by 20-25% in just a few weeks. says Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech. During the global lockdown, city-dwellers marveled at the cleaner air, brighter stars and walkable streets but even as the world reopens and pollution-spewing industries quickly undo all positive gains, Hayhoe points out that if humanity can repeat the feat with more wisdom and strategy than tragedy and fear, fast action is possible. I find this incredibly hopeful because if we made those changes permanent wed be halfway to the Paris Climate Accords target in just four weeks. I often feel as I am putting a Band-Aid on a bullet wound, Dr. Renee Salas testified before Congress this week as the emergency room physician and fellow at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health described a surge of Covid-19 and heat stroke patients at the same time. I may be able to improve their symptoms but then I send them back out my doors without having gone upstream to the root of the problem. Climate change is increasingly threatening the tools that I need to do my job as extreme heat and climate-intensified weather threaten our health care infrastructure, power, and supply chains. She described an equipment shortage in her Boston hospital triggered by Hurricane Maria, 1,700 miles away in Puerto Rico. We were forced to ration IV fluids and give the patients who didnt meet the severity criteria a bottle of Gatorade. While a new study links an explosion of novel disease with an increase in deforestation, Jonathan Foley hopes the pandemic helps people draw a direct line between forests and hospitals. Thats happening because were breaking down natural ecosystems, the climate scientist and director of Project Drawdown said. Otherwise we keep viruses in check and in the wild. But when we go in and tear down rainforest, were mixing viruses and people for the first time in history and look what happens. I hope what we learned is that these one-off events arent one-off at all. Theyre part of a larger pattern.",07/08/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/07/weather/5-lessons-coronavirus-climate-crisis-weir-wxc/index.html
"Last decade was Earth? hottest on record, exposing grim reality of climate change","A new report released Wednesday details how 2019 was another year of extremes for Earths climate, adding to a litany of evidence exposing the grim reality of our warming world. Last year saw devastating wildfires burn through Australia; large regions including Europe, Japan, Pakistan, and India experienced deadly heat waves; almost 100 tropical cyclones created havoc; glaciers and sea ice continued to melt at worrying levels; and drought and floods destroyed vital crops and infrastructure. Among the key findings of the State of the Climate in 2019, published by the American Meteorological Society, was that 2019 was among the warmest years on record, that greenhouse gases in the Earths atmosphere are at their highest recorded levels and this decade is the hottest since records began in the mid-1800s. Each decade since 1980 has been successively warmer than the preceding decade, with the most recent (2010-1019) being around 0.2C warmer than the previous (2000-2009), the report said. As a primary driver for our changing climate, the abundance of many long-lived greenhouse gases continues to increase. The study also reported other key findings: The warming influence of the major greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere  including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane and nitrous oxide  was 45% higher than in 1990, the researchers found. The burning of fossil fuels in our cars, airplanes, and factories releases heat-trapping pollution into the air, warming up our planet. Global carbon dioxide concentrations, which represent the bulk of the gases warming power, rose during 2010 to a record 409.8 parts per million, the study found. That was the highest in the modern 61-year measurement record as well as the highest ever measured in ice core records dating back as far as 800,000 years, the report said. The report was led by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations Centers for Environmental Information and was based on contributions from more than 520 scientists from 60 countries. The annual report is often described by meteorologists as the annual physical of the climate system. Robert Dunn, one of the reports lead editors from the UK Met Office, said in a statement that, The view for 2019 is that climate indicators and observations show that the global climate is continuing to change rapidly. A number of extreme events, such as wildfires, heatwaves and droughts, have at least part of their root linked to the rise in global temperature. And of course the rise in global temperature is linked to another climate indicator: the ongoing rise in emissions of greenhouse gases, notably carbon-dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane, Dunn said. July 2019 was Earths hottest month on record, the report found. More than a dozen countries across Africa, Europe, Asia, Australia, and the Caribbean reported record high annual temperatures last year. It was so warm that Belgium and the Netherlands saw 40C (104F) temperatures for the time. Deadly and intense heat waves last year exacerbated Indias water crisis  which saw entire cities running out of water  worsened drought conditions in Australia that led to months of destructive wildfires, and scorched Europes cities  which are not designed to deal with such temperatures. Dunn said that the start of this millennium has been warmer than any other period since the start of the Industrial Revolution. Global average temperature is perhaps the simplest climate indicator through which to view the changes taking place in our climate. 2019 was one of the top three warmest years in the historical record dating back to 1850. It also marks the end of a decade in which the average global temperature had risen by 0.2 C when compared with the previous decade, he said. Increasing ocean temperatures have continued to reduce sea ice at alarming levels. The extent and magnitude of ice loss over the Greenland ice sheet  the second biggest in the world  last year rivaled 2012, the previous year of record ice loss. Scientists found that after months of record temperatures, Greenlands ice sheet lost 197 billion tons of ice  the equivalent of around 80 million Olympic swimming pools in July 2019 alone. Melting of glaciers and ice sheets, along with warming oceans, account for the trend in rising global sea levels, the report said. In 2019, sea levels rose for the eighth consecutive year and hit a record high for the 27 years since satellite recordings began, having risen about 3.4 inches, or 87.6 millimeters, in that time above the 1993 average. The report comes as the world is struggling to contain the coronavirus pandemic, which is overwhelming many healthcare systems, and shattering economies across the world. Scientists have repeatedly warned that the impacts of the climate crisis to our health systems and economies will be much more severe if left unchecked. Experts say the pandemic has valuable lessons on preparing for future crises, such as acting early to mitigate against climate impacts, reducing emissions, developing green technology and implementing effective climate policies.",13/08/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/13/world/state-of-climate-report-2019-intl-hnk-scn/index.html
"Climate change spelled doom for woolly rhinos 14,000 years ago, study says","Woolly rhinos went extinct at the end of the last ice age in Siberia about 14,000 years ago, and now ancient DNA is helping to shed light on what really happened to them and other large mammals. Previously, it was believed that humans hunted these giant animals as they spread across the globe. But new research has suggested that climate change is the culprit, according to a new study based on sequencing ancient DNA from the well-preserved remains of 14 woolly rhinos. That we can read the DNA sequences, even the entire genomes, from these long-extinct animals is really amazing, senior study author Love Dalen said in an email. Dalen is a professor of evolutionary genetics at the Centre for Palaeogenetics, a joint venture between Stockholm University and the Swedish Museum of Natural History. Its a bit like having a time machine where we can travel back through time and study evolutionary change as it is happening in real-time. Given the climate where these animals lived and died, the cold conditions helped preserve their DNA. While obtaining high quality DNA is difficult, we are lucky to work on specimens that have been preserved in the permafrost for thousands of years, said Nicolas Dussex, study coauthor and a postdoctoral researcher at the Centre for Palaeogenetics, in an email. In a way, its like opening a freezer that was closed during the last Ice Age. The study published Thursday in the journal Current Biology. Rather than disappearing due to overhunting by early humans, woolly rhino populations actually seemed to thrive and remain incredibly diverse before they went extinct. Recent research has also shifted back the timeline for humans living in Siberia. Originally, it was believed they arrived between 14,000 and 15,000 years ago. New evidence has pushed human occupation back to sites that are at least 30,000 years old. So the arrival of humans no longer coincides with the demise of woolly rhinos, the researchers said. Instead, the DNA they studied revealed more of a population boom for woolly rhinos during that time. The DNA was retrieved from tissue, bone and hair samples from 14 woolly rhino specimens that lived across Siberia. The scientists were able to determine information about the population sizes and genetic diversity of these rhinos stretching back for tens of thousands of years before they went extinct. The researchers were surprised to discover that woolly rhinos had a much higher genetic diversity than any living rhino, woolly mammoths or even modern humans. The rhinos also appeared to go extinct suddenly, rather than gradually and did not experience much inbreeding. Inbreeding tends to increase as populations decline, and it occurred in the last woolly mammoths before they went extinct. The researchers also found genetic mutations in the rhino DNA that helped them adapt to life in the bitterly cold weather of the last ice age, including a receptor in the skin that could sense temperature variations. Woolly mammoths also had this adaptation. About 29,000 years ago, the woolly rhino population swelled as the ice age intensified and remained stable with little inbreeding. The data provided by the DNA followed the rhino population until about 18,500 years ago, which was about 4,500 years before they went extinct. This tells the researchers that the cause for their extinction occurred during that 4,500-year gap. A sudden but brief period of warming temperatures occurred toward the end of the last ice age. This event, called the Blling-Allerd interstadial, happened between 12,890 and 14,690 years ago. The temperature change was fast, said Dalen. Some records from ice cores taken on Greenland suggest an increase in temperature by 10 degrees Celsius (18 degrees Fahrenheit), possibly within as little as a few decades. The large grasslands where the wooly rhinos roamed, called a steppe environment, would have been replaced by trees and shrubs in response to the warming as well. Like woolly mammoths, woolly rhinos were covered in thick fur and perfectly suited to their cold environment, grazing across the Siberian tundra. Both had adaptations that helped them thrive during the last ice age. But mammoths were about three times bigger, had a more flexible diet and lived in matriarchal herds. The rhinos were likely more solitary, the researchers said. And the mammoths didnt experience an increase in population size as the rhinos did 29,000 years ago. Now the researchers want to study DNA from woolly rhinos that lived during those last 4,500 years before they went extinct. The scientists also want to investigate other large animals that had adapted to such cold conditions to see how they were affected by a warmer and less stable climate. This includes cave lions, wolves, mammoths, horses and steppe bison. Were coming away from the idea of humans taking over everything as soon as they come into an environment, said Edana Lord, study coauthor and postdoctoral student at the Centre for Palaeogenetics, in a statement. Although we cant rule out human involvement, we suggest that the woolly rhinoceros extinction was more likely related to climate.",13/08/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/13/world/woolly-rhinos-extinction-climate-change-scn/index.html
Transcript: Joe Biden? DNC speech,"Read Democratic presidential nominee Joe Bidens speech to the 2020 Democratic National Convention, as prepared for delivery: Good evening. Ella Baker, a giant of the civil rights movement, left us with this wisdom: Give people light and they will find a way. Give people light. Those are words for our time. The current president has cloaked America in darkness for much too long. Too much anger. Too much fear. Too much division. Here and now, I give you my word: If you entrust me with the presidency, I will draw on the best of us not the worst. I will be an ally of the light not of the darkness. Its time for us, for We the People, to come together. For make no mistake. United we can, and will, overcome this season of darkness in America. We will choose hope over fear, facts over fiction, fairness over privilege. I am a proud Democrat and I will be proud to carry the banner of our party into the general election. So, it is with great honor and humility that I accept this nomination for President of the United States of America. But while I will be a Democratic candidate, I will be an American president. I will work as hard for those who didnt support me as I will for those who did. Thats the job of a president. To represent all of us, not just our base or our party. This is not a partisan moment. This must be an American moment. Its a moment that calls for hope and light and love. Hope for our futures, light to see our way forward, and love for one another. America isnt just a collection of clashing interests of Red States or Blue States. Were so much bigger than that. Were so much better than that. Nearly a century ago, Franklin Roosevelt pledged a New Deal in a time of massive unemployment, uncertainty, and fear. Stricken by disease, stricken by a virus, FDR insisted that he would recover and prevail and he believed America could as well. And he did. And so can we. This campaign isnt just about winning votes. Its about winning the heart, and yes, the soul of America. Winning it for the generous among us, not the selfish. Winning it for the workers who keep this country going, not just the privileged few at the top. Winning it for those communities who have known the injustice of the knee on the neck. For all the young people who have known only an America of rising inequity and shrinking opportunity. They deserve to experience Americas promise in full. No generation ever knows what history will ask of it. All we can ever know is whether well be ready when that moment arrives. And now history has delivered us to one of the most difficult moments America has ever faced. Four historic crises. All at the same time. A perfect storm. The worst pandemic in over 100 years. The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. The most compelling call for racial justice since the 60s. And the undeniable realities and accelerating threats of climate change. So, the question for us is simple: Are we ready? I believe we are. We must be. All elections are important. But we know in our bones this one is more consequential. America is at an inflection point. A time of real peril, but of extraordinary possibilities. We can choose the path of becoming angrier, less hopeful, and more divided. A path of shadow and suspicion. Or we can choose a different path, and together, take this chance to heal, to be reborn, to unite. A path of hope and light. This is a life-changing election that will determine Americas future for a very long time. Character is on the ballot. Compassion is on the ballot. Decency, science, democracy. They are all on the ballot. Who we are as a nation. What we stand for. And, most importantly, who we want to be. Thats all on the ballot. And the choice could not be clearer. No rhetoric is needed. Just judge this president on the facts. 5 million Americans infected with COVID-19. More than 170,000 Americans have died. By far the worst performance of any nation on Earth. More than 50 million people have filed for unemployment this year. More than 10 million people are going to lose their health insurance this year. Nearly one in 6 small businesses have closed this year. If this president is re-elected we know what will happen. Cases and deaths will remain far too high. More mom and pop businesses will close their doors for good. Working families will struggle to get by, and yet, the wealthiest one percent will get tens of billions of dollars in new tax breaks. And the assault on the Affordable Care Act will continue until its destroyed, taking insurance away from more than 20 million people  including more than 15 million people on Medicaid  and getting rid of the protections that President Obama and I passed for people who suffer from a pre-existing condition. And speaking of President Obama, a man I was honored to serve alongside for 8 years as Vice President. Let me take this moment to say something we dont say nearly enough. Thank you, Mr. President. You were a great president. A president our children could  and did  look up to. No one will say that about the current occupant of the office. What we know about this president is if hes given four more years he will be what hes been the last four years. A president who takes no responsibility, refuses to lead, blames others, cozies up to dictators, and fans the flames of hate and division. He will wake up every day believing the job is all about him. Never about you. Is that the America you want for you, your family, your children? I see a different America. One that is generous and strong. Selfless and humble. Its an America we can rebuild together. As president, the first step I will take will be to get control of the virus thats ruined so many lives. Because I understand something this president doesnt. We will never get our economy back on track, we will never get our kids safely back to school, we will never have our lives back, until we deal with this virus. The tragedy of where we are today is it didnt have to be this bad. Just look around. Its not this bad in Canada. Or Europe. Or Japan. Or almost anywhere else in the world. The President keeps telling us the virus is going to disappear. He keeps waiting for a miracle. Well, I have news for him, no miracle is coming. We lead the world in confirmed cases. We lead the world in deaths. Our economy is in tatters, with Black, Latino, Asian American, and Native American communities bearing the brunt of it. And after all this time, the president still does not have a plan. Well, I do. If Im president on day one well implement the national strategy Ive been laying out since March. Well develop and deploy rapid tests with results available immediately. Well make the medical supplies and protective equipment our country needs. And well make them here in America. So we will never again be at the mercy of China and other foreign countries in order to protect our own people. Well make sure our schools have the resources they need to be open, safe, and effective. Well put the politics aside and take the muzzle off our experts so the public gets the information they need and deserve. The honest, unvarnished truth. They can deal with that. Well have a national mandate to wear a mask-not as a burden, but to protect each other. Its a patriotic duty. In short, I will do what we should have done from the very beginning. Our current president has failed in his most basic duty to this nation. He failed to protect us. He failed to protect America. And, my fellow Americans, that is unforgivable. As president, I will make you this promise: I will protect America. I will defend us from every attack. Seen. And unseen. Always. Without exception. Every time. Look, I understand its hard to have hope right now. On this summer night, let me take a moment to speak to those of you who have lost the most. I know how it feels to lose someone you love. I know that deep black hole that opens up in your chest. That you feel your whole being is sucked into it. I know how mean and cruel and unfair life can be sometimes. But Ive learned two things. First, your loved ones may have left this Earth but they never leave your heart. They will always be with you. And second, I found the best way through pain and loss and grief is to find purpose. As Gods children each of us have a purpose in our lives. And we have a great purpose as a nation: To open the doors of opportunity to all Americans. To save our democracy. To be a light to the world once again. To finally live up to and make real the words written in the sacred documents that founded this nation that all men and women are created equal. Endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights. Among them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. You know, my Dad was an honorable, decent man. He got knocked down a few times pretty hard, but always got up. He worked hard and built a great middle-class life for our family. He used to say, Joey, I dont expect the government to solve my problems, but I expect it to understand them. And then he would say: Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. Its about your dignity. Its about respect. Its about your place in your community. Its about looking your kids in the eye and say, honey, its going to be okay. Ive never forgotten those lessons. Thats why my economic plan is all about jobs, dignity, respect, and community. Together, we can, and we will, rebuild our economy. And when we do, well not only build it back, well build it back better. With modern roads, bridges, highways, broadband, ports and airports as a new foundation for economic growth. With pipes that transport clean water to every community. With 5 million new manufacturing and technology jobs so the future is made in America. With a health care system that lowers premiums, deductibles, and drug prices by building on the Affordable Care Act hes trying to rip away. With an education system that trains our people for the best jobs of the 21st century, where cost doesnt prevent young people from going to college, and student debt doesnt crush them when they get out. With child care and elder care that make it possible for parents to go to work and for the elderly to stay in their homes with dignity. With an immigration system that powers our economy and reflects our values. With newly empowered labor unions. With equal pay for women. With rising wages you can raise a family on. Yes, were going to do more than praise our essential workers. Were finally going to pay them. We can, and we will, deal with climate change. Its not only a crisis, its an enormous opportunity. An opportunity for America to lead the world in clean energy and create millions of new good-paying jobs in the process. And we can pay for these investments by ending loopholes and the presidents $1.3 trillion tax giveaway to the wealthiest 1 percent and the biggest, most profitable corporations, some of which pay no tax at all. Because we dont need a tax code that rewards wealth more than it rewards work. Im not looking to punish anyone. Far from it. But its long past time the wealthiest people and the biggest corporations in this country paid their fair share. For our seniors, Social Security is a sacred obligation, a sacred promise made. The current president is threatening to break that promise. Hes proposing to eliminate the tax that pays for almost half of Social Security without any way of making up for that lost revenue. I will not let it happen. If Im your president, were going to protect Social Security and Medicare. You have my word. One of the most powerful voices we hear in the country today is from our young people. Theyre speaking to the inequity and injustice that has grown up in America. Economic injustice. Racial injustice. Environmental injustice. I hear their voices and if you listen, you can hear them too. And whether its the existential threat posed by climate change, the daily fear of being gunned down in school, or the inability to get started in their first job  it will be the work of the next president to restore the promise of America to everyone. I wont have to do it alone. Because I will have a great Vice President at my side. Senator Kamala Harris. She is a powerful voice for this nation. Her story is the American story. She knows about all the obstacles thrown in the way of so many in our country. Women, Black women, Black Americans, South Asian Americans, immigrants, the left-out and left-behind. But shes overcome every obstacle shes ever faced. No ones been tougher on the big banks or the gun lobby. No ones been tougher in calling out this current administration for its extremism, its failure to follow the law, and its failure to simply tell the truth. Kamala and I both draw strength from our families. For Kamala, its Doug and their families. For me, its Jill and ours. No man deserves one great love in his life. But Ive known two. After losing my first wife in a car accident, Jill came into my life and put our family back together. Shes an educator. A mom. A military Mom. And an unstoppable force. If she puts her mind to it, just get out of the way. Because shes going to get it done. She was a great Second Lady and she will make a great First Lady for this nation, she loves this country so much. And I will have the strength that can only come from family. Hunter, Ashley and all our grandchildren, my brothers, my sister. They give me courage and lift me up. And while he is no longer with us, Beau inspires me every day. Beau served our nation in uniform. A decorated Iraq war veteran. So I take very personally the profound responsibility of serving as Commander in Chief. I will be a president who will stand with our allies and friends. I will make it clear to our adversaries the days of cozying up to dictators are over. Under President Biden, America will not turn a blind eye to Russian bounties on the heads of American soldiers. Nor will I put up with foreign interference in our most sacred democratic exercise  voting. I will stand always for our values of human rights and dignity. And I will work in common purpose for a more secure, peaceful, and prosperous world. History has thrust one more urgent task on us. Will we be the generation that finally wipes the stain of racism from our national character? I believe were up to it. I believe were ready. Just a week ago yesterday was the third anniversary of the events in Charlottesville. Remember seeing those neo-Nazis and Klansmen and white supremacists coming out of the fields with lighted torches? Veins bulging? Spewing the same anti-Semitic bile heard across Europe in the 30s? Remember the violent clash that ensued between those spreading hate and those with the courage to stand against it? Remember what the president said? There were quote, very fine people on both sides. It was a wake-up call for us as a country. And for me, a call to action. At that moment, I knew Id have to run. My father taught us that silence was complicity. And I could not remain silent or complicit. At the time, I said we were in a battle for the soul of this nation. And we are. One of the most important conversations Ive had this entire campaign is with someone who is too young to vote. I met with six-year old Gianna Floyd, a day before her Daddy George Floyd was laid to rest. She is incredibly brave. Ill never forget. When I leaned down to speak with her, she looked into my eyes and said Daddy, changed the world. Her words burrowed deep into my heart. Maybe George Floyds murder was the breaking point. Maybe John Lewis passing the inspiration. However it has come to be, America is ready to in Johns words, to lay down the heavy burdens of hate at last and to do the hard work of rooting out our systemic racism. Americas history tells us that it has been in our darkest moments that weve made our greatest progress. That weve found the light. And in this dark moment, I believe we are poised to make great progress again. That we can find the light once more. I have always believed you can define America in one word: Possibilities. That in America, everyone, and I mean everyone, should be given the opportunity to go as far as their dreams and God-given ability will take them. We can never lose that. In times as challenging as these, I believe there is only one way forward. As a united America. United in our pursuit of a more perfect Union. United in our dreams of a better future for us and for our children. United in our determination to make the coming years bright. Are we ready? I believe we are. This is a great nation. And we are a good and decent people. This is the United States of America. And there has never been anything weve been unable to accomplish when weve done it together. The Irish poet Seamus Heaney once wrote: History says, Dont hope on this side of the grave, But then, once in a lifetime The longed-for tidal wave Of justice can rise up, And hope and history rhyme This is our moment to make hope and history rhyme. With passion and purpose, let us begin  you and I together, one nation, under God  united in our love for America and united in our love for each other. For love is more powerful than hate. Hope is more powerful than fear. Light is more powerful than dark. This is our moment. This is our mission. May history be able to say that the end of this chapter of American darkness began here tonight as love and hope and light joined in the battle for the soul of the nation. And this is a battle that we, together, will win. I promise you. Thank you. And may God bless you. And may God protect our troops.",21/08/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/20/politics/biden-dnc-speech-transcript/index.html
"Alaskan salmon are decreasing in size thanks to climate change and competition, study says","Alaskan salmon are getting smaller due to climate change and competition, according to a new study. The authors researched over six decades of data from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game  from 1957 to 2018  on over 12.5 million fish. The primary cause of the declining body size of salmon, according to the study, is that the fish are spending less time out in the open Pacific Ocean. We saw a strong and consistent pattern that the salmon are returning to the rivers younger than they did historically, Eric Palkovacs, a professor at UC Santa Cruz and a corresponding author of the study, said in a news release. It seems that the ocean is becoming a riskier place to be, he said. The study looked at four species of salmon  Chinook, chum, coho and sockeye  throughout Alaska where residents have noticed a decrease in salmon size. Besides spawning at younger ages, climate change and competition from the growing numbers of wild and hatchery salmon are also significant factors in salmon size reduction, according to the study. We know that climate drives changes in ocean productivity, and we see a consistent signal of climate factors associated with decreasing salmon size, Palkovacs said. Another consistent association is with the abundance of salmon in the ocean, especially pink salmon, Palkovacs said. Their abundance in the North Pacific is at historic highs due in part to hatchery production in Alaska and Asia, and they compete with other salmon for food. Krista Oke, an author of the study and a scientist at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, said that the next thing the researchers want to analyze is what is causing the shift in the ocean itself. Theres not a single smoking gun, Oke said in the news release. Small contributions from a lot of factors are adding up to drive these changes.",21/08/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/20/us/alaskan-salmon-size-decreasing-trnd-scn/index.html
"Try this Earth-friendly diet: How to shop, cook and eat to fight climate change","There is no avoiding it  we have to eat every day. And as the effects of climate change become increasingly evident, the choices we make about what were eating are more significant than ever. With many of us cooking at home these days, there is more of an opportunity to use food to fight climate change. With these ingredient swaps and tweaks to your eating habits, you can help make a more positive impact on your health as well as the Earths. If you only make one switch in the service of the planet, cutting out red meat and animal proteins will have the greatest immediate impact. A diet without meat products can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 49 percent and water-scarcity weighted water footprint by 19 percent, said Galen Karlan-Mason, founder and CEO of GreenChoice, a grocery shopping app that helps consumers make informed choices about sustainability and nutrition, citing a 2018 study in the journal Science. Karlan-Mason cited a number of factors that make industrial agriculture one of the most environmentally taxing processes in global food production. We monocrop corn and soy and process it into feed, ship the feed to the cattle, provide land and water, and repeat for the life of the cattle, all while the cattle release methane gas daily. Plant-based meats, however, arent a one-to-one replacement for burgers and sausages. If we look at soy production, its second to beef in environmental damage  were replacing first degree murder with second degree murder, said Douglas Murray, associate professor and chair of the nutrition and food studies department at Montclair State University in New Jersey. From a nutritional perspective, these processed patties can still be just as high in saturated fat as a beef burger and contain higher levels of sodium, according to Harvard Medical School. So if youre choosing to cancel beef, exchanging it for a meatless option isnt a free pass to eat a soy burger every day. Beyond engineered substitutes, vegetarian protein sources are the obvious swap-in for meat. Most vegetables, as noted in the 2018 Science study, have less of a carbon footprint than even the least impactful animal protein sources, like fish, eggs and dairy. The phrase plant-based diet is a wide-ranging term that encompasses high-protein vegetarian foods like beans, lentils, leafy greens, quinoa and other unprocessed ingredients. Replacing beef with one of these in your chili, for example, is a small change that can also have a positive effect on your health. There is a correlation between vegetarian diets and sustained weight loss as well as lower risks for certain types of cancer and heart disease, multiple studies have shown. And incorporating plant-based proteins into everyday meals is easier than ever, thanks to a shifting popular mindset thats embracing meal-planning resources and recipes that incorporate these ingredients. Prepared items like grain bowls, cauliflower rice and veggie noodles are also more prevalent on menus and in supermarkets. As a bonus, keeping foods like beans and quinoa on hand lets you cook from your pantry more often, enabling you to skip frequent trips to the store during a pandemic. Though not as environmentally sustainable as vegetarian proteins, eggs are also a more climate-friendly swap, especially when they come from a local farm. They pack a lot of protein punch, and chicken and egg production is much less environmentally damaging than beef production, Murray said. If youd also like to switch to nondairy milk, Karlan-Mason recommended oat, soy and hazelnut milks as the best alternatives. Eat local has long been a sustainability mantra, and community farmers markets have proliferated over the past 15 years. The number of farmers markets nationwide skyrocketed from 1,755 in 1994 to 8,771 in 2019, according to the USDA. But surprisingly, fuel, transport and packaging dont have as much of an impact on emissions as you might think. It pales in comparison to the impact of the way land is used, said Shyla Raghav, vice president of climate change at Conservation International, with land use and farm emissions accounting for 80 percent of a foods carbon footprint and transport averaging 5 percent. While supporting local producers is an important part of the equation from an economic perspective, its not necessary to beat yourself up for indulging in pineapple, avocadoes or other treats that dont grow in your neck of the woods. Even almonds, which require a lot of water to produce, can be considered carbon-neutral because their trees store carbon instead of emitting it. And the trees water consumption per gallon is much lower than the amount of water needed to produce beef and other livestock. As a source of protein that replaces more intensive sources of protein, its positive, Raghav said. Like any other ingredient, local and sustainable options are always the best choice when it comes to seafood. Theres a lot of rampant overfishing thats affecting fish stocks around the world, Raghav said, so doing research before buying and eating fish is more important than ever. Farmed shrimp is the one item you should skip to have the greatest environmental impact in this category. Shrimp farming is the largest driver of mangrove deforestation, said Raghav, noting that mangroves are one of the most carbon-rich ecosystems on the planet. Their deforestation releases carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere, a process that makes farmed shrimp more environmentally damaging than pork or poultry. Instead, turn to smaller fish like anchovies and sardines, which dont take as much fuel or energy to process, especially in comparison to larger fin fish like tuna. And in terms of sustainable aquaculture, farmed bivalves like oysters and mussels can help clean up waterways through their natural filtering and feeding habits. If all of this sounds overwhelming or too complicated to truly make a difference, remember that what consumers can do is drive the demand, according to Murray. He cited the examples of organic certification and the removal of synthetic growth hormones from milk as two instances where purchasing choices made a lasting change in the food supply chain. If enough consumers try meatless Monday, it would have a real significant impact, he said.",24/08/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/24/health/eco-friendly-foods-wellness/index.html
Cardinal Dolan is making a mistake by praying at RNC,"St. Nicholas of Tolentine Church in the Bronx, New York was founded in 1905 as an Irish-Catholic refuge for a largely immigrant population in search of a spiritual home. Today, it remains a haven for immigrants from Central and South America and Southeast Asia. Over 30 years ago, as an Augustinian priest, I served as the pastor of this urban parish and had the chance to experience the daily hospitality and inclusion that had been seamlessly offered to and embraced by the churchs newest arrivals. In many ways, there was nothing so remarkable about this. Then and now, the biblical mandate of welcoming the stranger remains at the heart of the gospel. Its what Christians  and specifically Catholics  are supposed to do. Monday night, Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the Archbishop of New York will be offering the opening prayer at the Republican National Convention. This event is a gathering of President Donald Trumps Republican party, which has been defined by the message that arguably won Trump the White House in 2016  a message about building a wall to keep out immigrants, expressed in language that was often graphic, racist and cruel. This is not the first time that Cardinal Dolan has offered prayers at a convention. He delivered the invocation at both the Democratic and Republican conventions in 2012. But that was eight years ago. That was before the nation had the opportunity to experience this President and his GOP enablers not only to use demeaning language to garner support for keeping out immigrants, but also divide families at the border and place children in what many would consider unlivable conditions. That was before the tear gassing of peaceful protesters, the sympathetic tone delivered to the very fine people on both sides of the rally in Charlottesville or the smattering of racist and sexist language that Trump has continually used against those who dare to challenge him or his policies. Although Trump identifies as Presbyterian, he is known to have reportedly referred to himself as the best President for the Catholic church in our nations history. And yet, there are vast differences between Trump and his Catholic, Democratic opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden, which will likely be on display at this weeks GOP convention. Its not just their differences in policy and personality that will be made evident; even greater are their differences in how they seem to be guided by their faith. To be Catholic as the gospels remind us is to love your neighbor  even and especially those who are excluded and marked by difference. To be Catholic is to protect the environment as Pope Francis so clearly laid out in his encyclical Laudato Si where he affirms the existence of climate change and decries its impact on the poor. To be Catholic is to actively promote access to health care and support efforts to reduce gun violence. These markers represent just some of what it means to be truly Catholic  but Biden exemplifies them while Trump falls spectacularly short. This is why its so hard to understand why Cardinal Dolan has agreed to stand before the Republican convention. In response to questions about his participation in the RNC, Dolan has said: I want to say that I maintain almost neutrality when it comes to politics ... If we dont pray for America, as Catholics, who will? But Dolan should understand the power of his presence at the convention and be mindful that this gesture will be seen by many as an affirmation of the President  or at least a statement that all we have seen and heard from him these past three years has yet to disqualify him as the faith-based President he presents himself as. Instead, it gives every appearance of another hierarchical hit job on Bidens pro-choice views  something that too many bishops and priests call out as the only Catholic issue that ever matters. Sixty years ago, next month, a Catholic President in the midst of a presidential campaign delivered a now famous speech to Southern Baptists in Houston, Texas. At the time, many non-Catholics viewed Kennedy with suspicion. They feared that his being Catholic would prevent him from governing freely and without the undue influence of the church. Kennedy responded strongly and emphatically his respect for the separation of church and state when he said, I do not speak for the church on public matters  and the church does not speak for me. Sixty years later, we have a candidate who, while not Catholic, seeks to blur the lines of separation between himself and the church and embrace a connection that he presumably hopes will reap dividends in heavily Catholic battleground states. Cardinal Dolan, like so many of the Republicans who will be praying with him, seems prepared to become another enabling pawn in Trumps strategy to divide and conquer. One can only hope that voters will find in the contrast between these two candidates a clearer image of what it means to truly be Catholic  even if that level of clarity may have been lost on Republican leaders.",24/08/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/24/opinions/cardinal-dolan-praying-rnc-frawley/index.html
"Hurricanes, fires, floods and locusts: Science says climate change is here but the RNC refuses to believe","The words Biblical proportion come to mind, but even the Plagues of Egypt didnt come all at once. In 2020, we have giant swarms of locusts from East Africa to India, 500-year floods in Europe, fears of a dam collapse in China and Typhoon Bavi hitting the Korean Peninsula. In the US alone there is the record-smashing hurricane in the South, a million-acre gigafire in the West and over 40% of Iowa corn and soybeans flattened by 140 mph winds. Complicating the mounting task of saving lives and livelihoods in this ongoing climate crisis: a new disease, released from a natural world out of balance. Two tiny foes  coronavirus and heat-trapping gas  joining forces to make pandemic patients in Lake Charles, Louisiana, worry about blown roofs and falling trees. They are forcing California firefighters to socially-distance on 72-hour shifts after more than 10,000 dry lightning strikes started 500 fires. Threat multiplier is the adjective the US military first applied to climate change in 1990, when predictions of death, desperation and tension were mostly for distant corners of a warming world. But now, here at home, the threats seem to multiply by the hour. As an example of the Sophies Choices that come from such confluence of unnatural disaster, President Trump hopes to divert $40+ billion from FEMAs Emergency Response Fund to a fresh round of unemployment relief for the tens of millions driven out of work by Covid-19. In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom furloughed nonviolent convicts in a desperate attempt to slow prison outbreaks and as a result, lost vital firefighting manpower. For so long in studying climate change, were studying the future, says Katharine Hayhoe, director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech University. And now the future is here. So, if we live here in Texas, were seeing stronger and bigger and slower hurricanes with a lot more rainfall. If we live in the west, were seeing that natural wildfires are burning greater and greater area. If we live in the Midwest, warmer temperatures are supersizing our rainstorms. Juicing these changes, she says, are the very Gulf oil platforms, refineries and petrochemical plants punished by Hurricane Laura ... and Harvey, Michael, Rita, Ike, Katrina et al. Almost every other developed nation in the world understands the basic physics that the more they pump and burn, the more unpredictable life on Earth will become. But watching the Republican National Convention, if you didnt know, youd never know. Vice President Mike Pence offered warnings and good wishes for those in the path of Hurricane Laura on Wednesday night and on Thursday, President Donald Trump started his speech mentioning the people who had come through the wrath of the storm. He said it was fierce, one of the strongest to make landfall in 150 years, then added that the casualties and damage were far less than thought possible just a day earlier. Night after night, speaker after speaker made no mention of the scientific consensus that burning fossil fuel is making your parents hurricanes, floods and wildfires much, much worse. While the Democrats drilled down and got specific on their promises should they get a chance to govern, most mentions of the environment by the Republicans came in celebration of regulation rollbacks and harsh rejections of Joe Bidens plan to spend $2 trillion on clean energy projects and reenter the Paris Climate Accord. The Democratic Party of Joe Biden is pushing this so-called Green New Deal, said Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst in a pre-taped speech. She mocked efforts by Democrats to legislate the climate crisis after referencing the August 10 derecho that ripped apart ten million acres of her state. If given power, they would essentially ban animal agriculture and eliminate gas powered cars. It would destroy agriculture industry not just here in Iowa but across the country. This is untrue. The 14-page Green New Deal resolution calls for working collaboratively with farmers and ranchers in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector as much as is technologically feasible, but there is no call for a ban on cows or gasoline cars. How much does the 2018 Camp Fire cost, just to fight? Just to put out the flames? I asked Gov. Newsom after ferocious winds made the Camp Fire the most destructive wildfire in state history. It is jaw-dropping  the numbers  and they continue to escalate, Newsom replied. Just the debris removal is in multi, not billion, multi-billion-dollar expense. The second and third biggest fires in state history are now burning at the same time and the windy season hasnt even begun. Folks think, well, we cant afford to address climate change, Newsom says. My gosh. The naivete of that. Because the most expensive option is doing nothing. How did climate change become so politically polarized? Hayhoe asks. Its not the science, its the solutions. Weve been told that the only solutions to climate change are negative or punitive. They involve destroying the economy, throwing people out of work and letting the United Nations rule the world. Blurred by this message, she says Americans miss how much progress is happening between disasters. They dont know that 70% of new electricity being installed around the world now is clean energy. Theyre unaware that solar energy plus storage is actually cheaper than natural gas in California. Or that Texas has more installed wind energy than any other state in the country. Or that Texas has the first carbon neutral airport in DFW, and Ft. Hood, the biggest army base in the US is supplied entirely by wind and solar energy. The reality is that the solutions are already here. But if Hayhoe sees the solutions, others see the pain along the way. Its gonna get worse before we get better, says Lt. General Russel Honore. We have to find solutions to pollution that will drive the future economy. Known as the Ragin Cajun, Honore took over following a disastrous state and federal response to Hurricane Katrina. The storm and its aftermath killed at least 1,833 people, almost 15 years ago to the day. Right after Katrina we had Rita. A reporter asked me, We just had two hurricanes. Do you think that has anything to do with global warming? And I was stunned. I gave her some smart answer, but it haunted me for days, he says. At the time, the Department of Defense was keen to the threat of sea level rise to bases around the country, but the question suddenly made the science personal, as Honore saw his own beloved bayou communities drown after lack of official planning and imagination. Fifteen years later, Honore spends most hours thinking about fixes for the Gulf and the nation he served. We can start fixing our infrastructure. Lets adjust the damage done, create jobs that reduce the impact on the air and the water and the land. I think weve got to have adult conversation, regardless of what political class, he said. Taking action is critical for people like Hayhoe. There is no right answer in how to fix climate change, she says. There is no silver bullet either. Just a lot of silver buckshot. But we are all responsible to our families, to our loved ones, to our children, to the poor and the marginalized and the vulnerable right here where we live, as well as around the world to take our heads out of the sand to recognize that climate is changing. Humans are responsible. The impacts are serious. And we can act now. No matter who we are and how we vote.",28/08/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/28/weather/rapid-fire-disasters-in-coronavirus-pandemic-weir-wxc/index.html
Climate change didn? cause Hurricane Laura but it did make the storm worse,"Hurricane Laura was a formidable storm when it made landfall in Louisiana on Thursday. Laura broke multiple records, including the highest water level ever recorded at the Mermentau River gauge at Grand Chenier location. The gauge topped out at 17.14 feet, more than 4 feet above the previous high of 13 feet from Hurricane Audrey in June 1957, according to the US Army Corps of Engineers. Another notable record was that Laura was the seventh named storm to make landfall in the US so far in 2020, the most to do so before the end of August (four tropical storms and three hurricanes). This begs the question, why are so many more named storms impacting the US? The planet has warmed significantly over the past several decades, causing changes in the environment in which extreme weather events are occurring. A study of 40 years of satellite data of global storms by researchers at the University of Wisconsin and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) found that the probability of storms reaching major hurricane status  Category 3 or above with sustained winds of 110 mph or higher  has increased decade after decade. The study found that hurricanes, typhoons, and tropical cyclones worldwide are becoming stronger and potentially more deadly as the globe warms due to the climate crisis. The change is about 8% per decade, Jim Kossin, author of the study, told CNN in May when the study was released. In other words, during its lifetime, a hurricane is 8% more likely to be a major hurricane in this decade compared to the last decade. One way a hurricane strengthens is by traveling over warm water. Ocean surface water temperature needs to be at least 80 degrees  more than 86 degrees Fahrenheit is ideal  with that heat extending beneath the surface. High-altitude winds need to be calm, so they dont disrupt thunderstorm activity. When Laura moved through the Gulf of Mexico, sea surface temperatures were in the upper 80s. A storms internal conditions also must be exactly right. A hurricane needs a way to ventilate, much like a car engine, so it can continue to process all of the fuel from the warm water and use it to strengthen the storm. According to the National Hurricane Center, rapid intensification is when a tropical system sees a sustained wind increase of at least 35 mph in 24 hours or less. Lauras wind speed increased 45 mph in 24 hours, going from 65 mph to 110 mph between 5 a.m. Tuesday and 5 a.m. Wednesday. It is important to note that no one single storm can be attributed to climate change. Laura alone was not created solely by climate change. In fact, you could make a bigger argument that the absence of El Nino, (or even the forecast presence of La Nina) was more of a cause. But strong, rapidly intensifying storms like Laura are more likely to occur in general thanks to climate change. Due to climate change, ocean temperatures are well above normal. The warmer the ocean is when a tropical system moves into it, the more likely it is to intensify. According to NASA, ocean temperatures also influence the development of tropical storms and hurricane, which take energy from warm ocean waters to form and intensify. So, if the ocean temperatures are much warmer than they normally would be, then storms should, in theory, be able to intensify more than they normally would, given all other circumstances are also equal. Warmer ocean temperatures will not create a hurricane, but an existing storm system can strengthen into a more powerful storm due to warmer ocean temperatures. But not all facets of climate change regarding tropical systems are bad. For example, wind shear  the change in wind speed and/or direction is another element that may increase due to climate change and could be beneficial. Wind shear, if there is a decent amount of it, can actually tear tropical systems apart. We saw this with Hurricane Marco as it moved into the Gulf of Mexico. In theory, the ocean temperatures were very warm  fuel for hurricanes to develop further  but even with that added ingredient, Marco could not overcome the strong wind shear, and associated dry air, and eventually weakened and fell apart shortly after landfall. But there can be destructive consequences. One of the effects of climate change that scientists are most certain of is increased rainfall amounts and rainfall intensity  a result of warmer than normal ocean temperatures that create a warmer and more moist environment for the storm. Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, previously told CNN that climate change leads to these warmer and wetter environments and sets the stage for what can be the storms biggest threat: heavy rainfall and flash flooding. We saw it with Hurricanes Florence, Harvey, Michael, Dorian, and again with Laura. Warmer oceans mean more moisture is available in a warmer atmosphere. Its one of the simplest relationships in all of meteorology, said Michael Mann, an atmospheric science professor and director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University. For every 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degree Fahrenheit), there is 7% more moisture in the air. With Hurricane Florence in 2018, ocean temperatures were trending around 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal, which contributed to nearly 10% more moisture available in the atmosphere. Florence ended up becoming the wettest tropical system to strike the US East Coast, dumping almost 3 feet of rain on parts of North Carolina. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has said the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season will likely be extremely active, perhaps even historic, with even more records likely to fall. NOAA predicts 19 to 25 named storms this season and the agency has never forecast up to 25 storms in a season, And the season hasnt even hit its peak, which statistically occurs on September 10.",30/08/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/30/weather/weather-hurricane-laura-climate-impacts-scope/index.html
"Mastodons migrated across extreme distances due to climate change, study says","American mastodons migrated many times across thousands of miles up and down the North American continent over 800,000 years due to climate change, before going extinct 11,000 years ago, according to a new study. Mastodons were once some of the largest living land animals on Earth. This 800,000-year period was a bit of a climate roller coaster of ice ages. Cold glacial periods were followed by warmer interglacial periods when ice sheets would retract, creating forests and wetlands where once there was only ice. Researchers never knew how mastodons reacted to these changes until now. The genetic data show a strong signal of migration, moving back and forth across the continent, driven, what appears to be entirely by climate, said study co-author Hendrik Poinar in a statement. Poinar is an evolutionary geneticist and director of the McMaster University Ancient DNA Centre in Ontario, Canada. The study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications. These changes attracted mastodons that ranged northward during these warmer times to seek out shrubs and low-hanging tree branches. Unlike woolly mammoths that thrived in colder settings and icy grasslands, mastodons  a relative of mammoths and elephants  preferred wet and warm wooded and swampy environments. But as the mastodons roamed from Central Mexico up to present-day Alaska, the Yukon and Nova Scotia, the climate would shift again. The warm temperatures of the interglacial period, similar to temperatures we experience today, would drop and the ice would return. The temperature fluctuations between these periods, researchers estimated, could shift more than 18 degrees Fahrenheit. And glacial periods could cause an expansion of the ice sheet, covering 50% of North Americas habitable land. These groups of mastodons that migrated north would die out. Then, another group of them would migrate north again when the temperatures changed. The researchers know this because there is no continuity to suggest that they survived the cyclical deep freezes over the 800,000-year period, the study said. And the groups that migrated northward to the Arctic during these warm periods were less genetically diverse, meaning they were very similar to one another. This also made them more vulnerable to extinction, the scientists said. Mastodons went extinct about 11,000 years ago about the same time that other large land animals, like woolly mammoths, giant ground sloths and saber-toothed cats also disappeared. But understanding why these large land animals went extinct is more difficult. Scientists believe a combination of competition for food, climate change and overhunting by early humans is to blame. These animals preferred different environments, so we would expect them to have very different responses to the repeating glacial/interglacial cycles, said Emil Karpinksi, lead study author and a graduate student at the Ancient DNA Centre and the department of biology at McMaster University. While the warm periods provided a new food source for mastodons, it also removed environments like grasslands that were suited for horses, mammoths and bison as more trees encroached. The researchers studied the fossils from 33 different mastodons and were able to reconstruct DNA from their teeth, tusks and bones. The DNA revealed five distinct groups of mastodons. Two came from eastern Beringia, or a region that once joined Russia to the US, and those groups resulted from migrations to this area during warm interglacial periods. And these ancient mastodons lack of genetic diversity made them vulnerable to further changes in the environment. Previous research has largely focused on mammoths, as well as bison and musk ox, which thrived in the cold grasslands called tundra steppes. The new study not only greatly increases the amount of genetic information for the American mastodon and provides a solid framework for future studies on the animal, Karpinski said. I think it further illustrates that the extinction of mastodons and other big animals was probably much more nuanced than many people think, he said. Its difficult for me to think climate didnt play a role when these animals clearly had such drastic responses. But the study also provided takeaways for animals currently experiencing and reacting to climate change, like moose and beavers. A big part of why we study these extinct species is to see if we cant find clues to how extant species may respond to events like the anthropogenic warming were experiencing now, Karpinski said. As the climate warms, these current-day populations have expanded their ranges northward by as as much as 10 to hundreds of kilometers every century, the researchers said. While many have seen this as a positive change for these species, ultimately, these animals could suffer if their southern populations are lost. If these expanding northern populations are genetically similar to one another, like the northward-ranging mastodons, that could have long-term consequences for their conservation. That is always a danger signal for vertebrate species, said Grant Zazula, study coauthor and paleontologist with the Government of Yukon, in a statement. If you lose genetic diversity, you are losing ability to respond to new conditions. In this case, they were not up there long enough to adapt to northern conditions when they cycled back to cold. This change applies to other animals as well that react to climate change by expanding into new territories. Today, you might think that its great to see animals like brown bears in northern Canada and the Arctic islands, well beyond their historical range. They are obviously benefiting, just like these mastodons did for a time, as a result of natural climate change, said Ross MacPhee, study coauthor and a senior curator in the American Museum of National Historys department of mammalogy, in a statement. But that benefit can be very limited. Its important to realize that what we might think is beneficial change at one level for some species is not necessarily all that good for others.",01/09/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/01/world/mastodon-climate-change-study-scn/index.html
Gen Z conservatives build new groups for anti-Trump Republicans,"Elle Kalisz watched both the Democratic and Republican National Conventions over the past two weeks as a person without a party. A senior at American University, Kalisz, 21, grew up in a small freight town on the border of Illinois and Wisconsin, where she was taught to work for what you have, but to love your neighbor, she said. She considers herself a young conservative, but for a while now, Kalisz said she has been unable to associate with either party and was disappointed with what she described as harmful and hateful rhetoric and the notion of fear perpetuated during the RNC. Meanwhile, she said watching the DNC was also upsetting; its hard for her to watch the Democrats describe themselves as the only solution for issues like climate change or fixing racial disparities, she explained. Kalisz isnt alone. Many center-right Gen Z voters, who prioritize small government, capitalism and free market values but care deeply about climate change, racial justice and health care access (all issues embraced by the Democratic Party), say they feel lost and without a home in the current political conversation. These voters are disillusioned with Trump and the state of the Republican Party, which they say is one that spews hate and misinformation. But they are also uncomfortable with Joe Biden and the Democratic platform. Right now your option as a Gen Z voter is a set of specific policies that are being pushed by the left that you dont agree with or a party that cant even say that these are an issue, so where do you go? Kalisz asked. As of June, 22% of young voters (ages 18-36) identified as Republican, while 34% identified as Democrats, according to GenForward, a survey associated with the University of Chicago. An additional 29% of young voters identified as independents, and the remaining young voters were undecided or declined to respond. The Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts found that some young voters who previously voted for Republican candidates are likely to vote for Biden in November. According to its research, almost 20% of young voters who voted for a GOP candidate in 2018 and 8% of young Trump voters in 2016 are planning to support Biden. In March, college students at American University launched College Republicans for Biden, a group of young conservatives disaffected with Trump who are proud to support the Democratic nominee. According to Christopher Trzaska, the founder of the group, College Republicans for Biden is now on many campuses around the country and intends to go all in for Biden, he said, because Biden is not only a palatable, but also a preferable alternative to Trump. Trzaska jumped on the Biden bandwagon early on in the Democratic primary; as a conservative, Trzaska said he likely would not have supported progressive candidates like Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, or really any of the other Democratic candidates. Trzaska believes that Biden would be apt to lead the country on day one because of his decades of foreign policy experience. Donald Trump is destructive to Democracy, Trzaska said, explaining his reasoning for supporting Biden. From our perspective... Im referring to this election specifically, and getting a message out there that young people do not have to fall into the dichotomy of hard core Democrat leftism that often happens on college campuses, nor do they have to fall into the Trump cult of personality trap that is also seen on college campuses. College Republicans for Biden has ambassadors and representatives on campuses across the country to help students see that theyre not alone, Trzaska said. The group hopes to demonstrate to like-minded young conservatives that its OK to feel upset with the current state of the Republican Party, to seek change, and to vote for Biden in this moment. Trzaska thinks theres still hope that the Republican Party can be saved, that people are willing to put in the work, and young people are willing to say, this Trump thing was a mistake, it backfired horribly, lets go try something new, lets rebuild the party, he said. One group, putting in the work that Trzaska referenced, is gen z gop. Earlier this summer, four young Republicans from Massachusetts  Mike Brodo, Ryan Doucette, Samuel Garber and John Olds  united to start a podcast that would provide young conservatives with conversation on issues they care about that they felt were being ignored by the Republican Party. But before dropping their first episode, the founders decided they needed to be more than a podcast. The group launched an organization: gen z gop, which aims to be a home for young Republicans, seeking nuanced debate based off fact and science, looking to build the future of the Republican Party. The group is based off three pillars: finding balance, formulating solutions and focusing on the future, and so far is entirely self funded by the founders. According to Brodo, the executive director of gen z gop, they aim to start a movement within their generation and within the Republican Party at large. In late July, the group launched with a video on Twitter. The following day, their first podcast episode, titled republicans, weve got a problem, went live on Spotify and Apple Music. Over the past few years, our political system has proven broken. Our party hijacked. Our values forgotten. As Republicans, we believe that the party of Lincoln is worth saving from its current flirtation with authoritarian populism. But we do not seek to return to the politics of the past, gen z gop says in their launch video. We seek to present a new vision. Part of gen z gops vision, they explain, includes building a Republican Party that pursues climate change solutions, proclaims Black lives matter, and looks to private public partnerships to provide an alternative to Medicare for All. We need a party that can embrace discussion in nuanced ways so that we can have debates in the first place... if you look at a Gen Z voter and you asked, What do they care about? And they say climate change, racial injustice, you know, healthcare, theyre only going to vote for Democrats because... thats the party thats talking about those issues. But we dont want the country to go down that path... we want the Republican party to have good faith actors that come to the table and embrace the issues, Brodo said. Brodo started his political career in 2016 at the age of 16, knocking on doors in New Hampshire for Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who was then running for president. Following the 2016 election, Brodo chaired the Massachusetts Teenage Republicans where he met Doucette and Garber, who both went on to chair MA Teenage Republicans as well. Doucette, chief of staff for the group, and Garber, its communications director, brought Olds, who they knew from local Massachusetts campaigns, into the mix. Olds serves as the groups political director. Brodo, now 20 and a junior at Georgetown University, said the group initially received criticism because it was founded by four White men from the same state. Since their launch, gen z gop has expanded in gender, racial and geographic diversity. So far, the group has received over 200 applications and has convened a team of 30 members, demonstrating the appetite from young people to rewrite the narrative of the current Republican Party, they say. According to the groups founders, their organization includes members from Massachusetts and Illinois, as well as Virginia, North Carolina, Missouri, California, Kentucky, Mississippi, Florida, Texas and New York. Members include those who identify as Black, Hispanic, Asian, White and mixed racial backgrounds. While most members of gen z gop are center right, the group does not intend to be a monolith, and so far, according to Javon Price, diversity of thought is one of the things he appreciates most about the group. Price, a 22-year-old senior at Georgetown University from Northern Virginia, was formerly the co-chair of Georgetowns chapter of Students for Trump. He now serves as the director of external affairs with gen z gop. Asked why he joined gen z gop, Price said that as a young Black man, he does not believe the Republican Party has ignored Black and other minority communities, but he believes the Republican party hasnt paid the Black community and other minority communities the attention they deserve. I think that frankly, a lot of Black and brown communities are more conservative in nature and the party has to do justice due diligence to reach out to us. Itd be a good idea. Price says that with his involvement, he hopes to show that young Black men can identify as conservative, even if its not the most popular or cool thing to do. It speaks volumes of the organization, Price said of his prior involvement with Students for Trump, adding that gen z gop is not an election-based organization. gen z gop is an organization thats focused on really policy and the solutions and policy issues that we want to put forward. What were trying to do is more than an election in November ... The conversation that were trying to start here is ensuring that issues that are related to young folk like ourselves are really being pushed. So we dont have to wait until were in office. And these conversations need to start now because frankly these things affect us here and now. Likewise, Trzaska said College Republicans for Biden has convened a group of about 30 students from across the country including members from Texas and California. Trzaksa said the group has also connected with former national security officials from what he called Bush world, as well as certain Midwest faith-based organizations, he said. College Republicans for Biden and gen z gop are not the only youth-led conservative groups. Turning Point USA, founded in 2012 by Charlie Kirk, has become a leading organization for young Republicans. The group has fully embraced Trump and his rhetoric. Some of Turning Point USAs taglines include Socialism Sucks and Big Gov Sucks. TPUSA members, including Kirk, frequently take to Twitter to criticize the left. Kirk recently tweeted, Democrats are the party of arson, riots, looting, and lawlessness, and has previously tweeted that BLM inc is a domestic terror organization. Kirk spoke at the Republican National Convention last week. During his RNC speech, Kirk misled on pastors being locked up. He claimed that bitter, deceitful, vengeful activists...have us locking up pastors, which is a false connection. Pastors in the US have been arrested for disobeying state and local social distancing orders during the pandemic by holding in-person church services. Kirk has penned two books, The MAGA Doctrine and Campus Battlefield: How Conservatives Can WIN the Battle on Campus and Why It Matters. While Kirk represents a portion of right-leaning young voters, both College Republicans for Biden and gen z gop aim to provide alternative spaces for young conservatives on college campuses. Brodo told CNN that gen z gop hopes to build a counter movement to Turning Point USA on the same side of the aisle, calling Turning Point USA extreme. Their messaging now is all about the culture war, Brodo said, speaking to the way that Kirk and Turning Point USA call out left-leaning thought on college campuses. Turning Point USA runs a website called Professor Watchlist, which lists college professors who the organization say discriminate against conservative students and advance leftist propaganda in the classroom. Who gains from that? Trzaska asked. Weve seen a lot of people really shirk our responsibility to having an intellectual, honest debate about conservative policy position. And instead focus on, you know, getting as many liberals mad as they possibly can, he said, adding that some right-leaning groups on college campuses are causing a ruckus for no reason. Although College Republicans for Biden is outwardly endorsing and is built around supporting Biden, gen z gop is not. When asked why they are not endorsing Biden, the founders of gen z gop said they dont feel they can associate with either of these candidates and they dont believe they have to take a stand in Novembers election to drive change in the future of the Republican party. With that being said, certain members of gen z gop will vote for Biden in November. While they hope to one day endorse like-minded Gen Z candidates, for now, gen z gop is focused on starting conversation and bringing young people who may be turned off from politics to the table. I think thats kind of the core mission here is kind of trying to appeal to people our age, getting them involved in politics, Brodo said. I think our biggest demographic that were appealing to is actually people that are not political junkies like myself, that are always talking about it. Its the people that care about politics to the level that any citizen should, but are just so turned off because of how polarized and disgusting a lot of the discourse is today.",02/09/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/02/politics/gen-z-conservatives-anti-trump-groups/index.html
Sen. Ed Markey defeats a Kennedy in Massachusetts,"Sen. Ed Markey beat back a bid on Tuesday from Rep. Joe Kennedy to end his nearly 50 years in elected office, humbling the Democratic Partys family dynasty that had never before lost an election in Massachusetts. The longtime legislator won the primary by campaigning as the most progressive person in the race, while emphasizing his roots as the son of a milkman from Malden. We made it clear that wed rather lose fighting as hard as we could for what we believe in than in finding the middle ground, said Markey in his victory speech. The progressive movement knows how to fight. We will not surrender. About a year ago, when it became clear that the congressman would run, Markey visited his parents gravesite, contemplated what to do and what his parents would do, and concluded he had to run for reelection, according to campaign manager John Walsh. His decision couldve been described as foolish. Kennedy, 39, led in the polls from the get-go, launching a campaign focused on social and economic justice while offering a generational change to the 74-year-old Markey, who has served in Congress for over four decades. But his critics attacked Kennedy for not articulating a reason for running besides his own ambition, and Markey deflected his opponents shine by projecting the power of some of the partys brightest stars. The two Democrats didnt disagree much on policy, but Markey established himself early on as the earliest adopter of liberal causes, pointing to his co-authorship of the Green New Deal and support of Medicare for All. Markey wore retro-hip Nikes and aligned himself with New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the party phenom, and the Sunrise Movement, a youthful group focused on combating climate change, to show he was of the times When it comes to progressive leadership, its not your age that counts, its the age of your ideas, Ocasio-Cortez said in an ad. And Ed Markey is the leader that we need. Markey suggested that Kennedy was a legislative lightweight, while claiming that he himself has written hundreds of laws providing affordable internet to schools and libraries, raising fuel economy standards for cars and trucks, raising billions of dollars for Alzheimers research and even deterring robocalls. He said he has led political revolutions since at least the 1980s, when he introduced the nuclear freeze resolution and nearly a million people gathered in New Yorks Central Park to demand an end to the nuclear arms race. Kennedy countered by poking holes in Markeys long record, including his votes for the Iraq War, NAFTA, the Patriot Act and the 1994 crime bill. Overall, Kennedy claimed that he would be a better senator, who could both deliver for his state and build the party across the country. He knocked Markey for spending less time at home in Massachusetts than any other member of the states congressional delegation, even when Sen. Elizabeth Warren was running for president, citing a Boston Globe analysis. But by the last month of the campaign, as mail-in voting began, polls showed Markey had taken the lead. There were signs that Kennedy was frustrated. He told CNN in August that the coronavirus pandemic without question hinders a challenger since it limited his ability to connect in person with people, which he viewed as one of his advantages in the race. Still, a masked Kennedy went on a whirlwind tour across the state and picked up the endorsement of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who noted the congressmans cross-country effort in 2018 to flip the House. As the pandemic raged on, Markey inverted former President John F. Kennedys famous call to action. Its time to start asking what your country can do for you, he said. In response, Kennedys campaign finally, explicitly portrayed him as the scion of a legacy shaped by former Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, former President Kennedy and former Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy, his grandfather and great-uncles. The narrator of one television ad said that the fights for health care for all, jobs and opportunity, and racial justice were in his blood. But on Tuesday, Markey blocked Kennedys path to the chamber where his fore-bearers once roamed. In his concession speech, Kennedy said his family had been invoked far more often than I anticipated and praised it for showing him the example of what public service should be. He then told his two children, If theres one message from your dad tonight, its this: Always spend your life in the ring. It is worth the fight. This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday night.",02/09/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/01/politics/massachusetts-primary-results-2020-markey/index.html
Unilever will stop using oil and gas to make cleaning products by 2030,"Unilever is spending 1 billion ($1.2 billion) to end the use of fossil fuels in the production of its cleaning and laundry brands. The consumer products company said Wednesday that by the end of the decade, household products such as Omo, Sunlight, Cif and Domestos will be made using only renewable or recycled carbon. That means swapping petrochemicals for materials sourced from plants and marine algae, as well as materials recovered from plastic waste and CO2 captured during production processes. As an industry, we must break our dependence on fossil fuels, including as a raw material for our products, said Peter ter Kulve, president of the conglomerates home care division. We must stop pumping carbon from under the ground when there is ample carbon on and above the ground  if we can learn to utilize it at scale. To help reach the goal, Unilever is working with a company in southern India on technology that will allow captured CO2 to be used as a raw material in the production of soda ash, a key ingredient in laundry detergents that is currently made with energy from fossil fuels. Its also partnering with a biotech company in Slovakia to develop a renewable and biodegradable ingredient for use in dishwashing liquid. The ingredient is already being used in Sunlight dishwashing liquid sold by Unilever in Chile and Vietnam. Unilever (UL) says its products are used by 2.5 billion people each day in 190 countries around the world. According to the company, seven out of 10 households around the world own at least one product from its 400 brands. The company pledged earlier this year to reach net zero emissions from its products by 2039, more than a decade ahead of the deadline laid out in the Paris Climate Agreement. Its also promised to make all 70,000 of its products biodegradable over the next 10 years and use less plastic packaging. Unilever has been recognized by CDP, which runs a global carbon disclosure system, as a corporate leader in environmental transparency and performance. It is one of only a handful of companies to receive the nonprofits top rating for climate change, forests and water security.",02/09/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/02/business/unilever-fossil-fuels-cleaning-products/index.html
? support Joe Biden? pro-science agenda? 81 Nobel laureates endorse Biden for president,"Eighty-one Nobel Prize winners endorsed Joe Biden for president in an open letter on Wednesday, citing the former vice presidents willingness to listen to experts and his deep appreciation for using science to find solutions. The Nobel laureates, winners of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Medicine and Physics, stressed the importance of elected leaders making decisions based on science, particularly during a global pandemic. At no time in our nations history has there been a greater need for our leaders to appreciate the value of science in formulating public policy, the letter reads. During his long record of public service, Joe Biden has consistently demonstrated his willingness to listen to experts, his understanding of the value of international collaboration in research and his respect for the contribution that immigrants make to the intellectual life of our country. Visit CNNs Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race The person who organized all of the laureates to endorse Biden is Illinois Democratic Rep. Bill Foster, who is the sole physicist on Capitol Hill, according to a person close to the Nobel Laureate group. More than 180,000 Americans have died from coronavirus, and more than 6 million people in the US have been infected with the virus, according to Johns Hopkins University. Trump has been heavily criticized for his administrations response to the pandemic, with critics saying his administration has been too slow to respond to the virus and it hasnt done enough to protect Americans. Nearly seven in 10 Americans say the US response to the coronavirus outbreak makes them feel embarrassed, according to a recent CNN Poll conducted by SSRS. Sixty-two percent of the public says Trump could be doing more to fight the outbreak, and disapproval of Trumps handling of the outbreak reached a new high of 58% in the poll. Biden, who has issued blistering criticism of Trumps coronavirus response, called on Trump to stop talking and start listening to the medical experts, in a March interview with CNN. In the past, Joe Biden has shown a deep appreciation for using science to find solutions to Americas ailments, said Harold Varmus, who has served as director of the National Institutes of Health and the National Cancer Institute and received the 1989 Nobel Prize in medicine. His sensible, determined approach to building a cancer research initiative after his sons death was inspiring. It illustrates the kind of thoughtful leadership that we need to tackle the current global pandemic. The multiple crises facing our country, including one of misinformation, requires a leader with profound admiration for science and truth, said Roger Kornberg, the winner of the 2006 Nobel Prize in chemistry. I support Joe Bidens pro-science agenda and sensible approach to public health decisions. A true leader who will face the truth and be honest with the American people. The endorsement from the Nobel laureates comes on the heels of a Washington Post report that one of Trumps top medical advisers was urging the White House to embrace a controversial herd immunity strategy to combat the pandemic. The approach would mean that many people nationwide would have to get sick with the coronavirus in order to build up a natural immunity across communities, and many could die in the process. White House coronavirus task force member Dr. Scott Atlas explicitly denied that he is pushing a herd immunity strategy, but an administration official told CNN all of the policies Atlas has pushed for are in the vein of a herd immunity strategy. View 2020 presidential election polling Now more than ever, our country needs elected leaders who make decisions based on science, said Elizabeth Blackburn, the winner of the 2009 Nobel Prize in medicine. Joe Biden is the strong, compassionate leader we need to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic. Hell listen to the scientific and medical community to create solutions that will finally get us out of this deadly pandemic and improve the health of the American people. Carol Greider, the winner of the 2009 Nobel Prize in medicine, said, Our elected leaders should be making decisions based on facts and science. I strongly endorse Joe Biden because of his commitment to putting public health professionals, not politicians, back in charge. I support Joe Biden because of his long record of making policy, informed by science, to deal with large, complicated issues like cancer, climate change and nuclear proliferation, said Barry Barish, the 2017 Nobel Prize winner in physics. More immediately, we absolutely must elect Joe with his science-based approach to successfully lead us out of the Covid-19 pandemic. Bidens plan to address the coronavirus pandemic includes offering free testing to all Americans. It calls for hiring 100,000 people to form a national contact-tracing, and increasing drive-through testing sites. He is also urging Trump to use the Defense Production Act to ramp up production of protective equipment for health care workers, testing supplies and other items. Biden has said he would mandate that everyone wear a mask in public if necessary, and on August 13 called for governors to implement mask mandates for the next three months. His plan includes steps designed to help businesses and schools reopen, including financial support for retaining and rehiring workers, building a best-practices clearinghouse for schools and guaranteeing paid leave for anyone with coronavirus or who is caring for someone with the virus. The former vice president also said he would call Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, shortly after being declared the winner of the general election to ask him to remain a member of the White House coronavirus task force.",02/09/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/02/politics/joe-biden-nobel-laureates-endorsement/index.html
?aised by Wolves?is the kind of sci-fi show that could put HBO Max on the map,"Raised by Wolves might be the years most original series, an audaciously cerebral science-fiction concept that covers so much ground in the premiere its hard to imagine where the show can ultimately go. Produced by Blade Runner and Aliens Ridley Scott  who also directed the first two episodes  its uneven in places, but by virtue of its risk-taking joins the alpha tier of the streaming pack. Created by Aaron Guzikowski (The Red Road), the premise defies a simple description. But its hard to escape the sobering real-world echoes of humans being forced to establish colonies beyond Earth, having ruined the planet not because of climate change as much as unfettered tribalism, and war between believers and atheists. In this case, we begin with the efforts of the atheists, which have dispatched a pair of androids  known as Mother (Amanda Collin) and Father (Abubakar Salim)  to the habitable planet Kepler-22b with a number of fertilized embryos. The plan is to birth and rear the children  which they do  to help lay the foundation for humanitys survival. The conditions, however, are hard, to say the least, throwing the group a number of unexpected curve balls. In addition, a ship enters the orbit thats basically an ark populated by the believers, raising the specter that the hostilities initiated on Earth will follow mankind into space. There have been a lot of performances by actors as androids, but its hard to think of one more creepily believable than Collin  fellow Scandinavian Alicia Vikanders work in Ex Machina comes to mind  which isnt intended to shortchange Salim, whose Father seeks to distract the children by telling awful Dad jokes. The cast also includes Travis Fimmel (Vikings) as a warrior aboard the other vessel, although thats about all anyone should give away regarding the arc of the series. Simply put, the show remains constantly surprising, with a visually arresting design and look that gets past a few less-than-blockbuster-worthy special effects. Its also a testament to the writing that the story draws you into its twists and turns  which include flashbacks to spoon out character details  despite the vast amount of plot that must be blocked out in order for any of this to make sense. HBO Max (like CNN, a unit of WarnerMedia) has gotten off to a fairly uninspired start in terms of its original programming, but Raised by Wolves represents the sort of wildly ambitious offering designed to make waves in the passion-driven streaming space. That could be especially true for those attracted to the services fantasy, sci-fi and comic-book fare, such as Game of Thrones and DC Entertainment. Even within that smaller universe, the series wont be for everyone. But it should make HBO Max a more subscription-worthy destination for a discriminating few. Raised by Wolves premieres Sept. 3 on HBO Max.",03/09/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/03/entertainment/raised-by-wolves-review/index.html
"6 ways to make healthy, simple kids?lunches in an unusual school year","Whether your kids will be at school at all times, fully remote or on a hybrid schedule, there is a good likelihood that time will be spent making lunches at home. Im a mother of two girls whose schools are going fully remote this September, so its on my mind. So what are some strategies for making lunches easy, fun and nutritious? And are there ways that kids can help, too? Yes, on both counts. I love making lunches with my daughters because they not only learn how different foods nourish their minds and bodies; it also offers them a sense of accomplishment. Measuring ingredients when following new recipes or dividing up a pizza for the family also reinforces their math skills, which is an added bonus. Here are some of my own tips and recipes, along with advice from other nutrition and culinary experts on preparing healthy, simple and tasty lunches for this unconventional school year. Whether you have a toddler, tween or teenager, you and your child can prepare school lunches that will keep your family nourished and organized as the school year unfolds. Even if you arent going anywhere except to the dining room table for school, planning is important, said Kristi King, senior pediatric dietitian at Texas Childrens Hospital and an Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics spokesperson. This is a time of uncertainty and planning can help establish a sense of normalcy for kids, King said. Not to mention, preparing the lunch just as if you would pack it for school will help prevent your children from mindless eating and wandering to the kitchen. If school is remote, making lunch in advance can also spare working parents from having to interrupt their workday to make a midday meal, explained Victoria Stein Feltman, a registered dietitian and co-founder of Apple to Zucchini, a healthy-eating resource for parents and families. To make the week ahead less stressful, designate a time during the weekend when you can plan ahead for the weeks lunches. This will allow you to know which foods youll need on hand. You can also design a weekly lunch menu and post it on the refrigerator. Like any other new school year, create some excitement by purchasing a new lunch box or bag, even if your child will be learning from home. Nutrition experts recommend bento box-style containers, which offer easy portion control and separation of various foods and are great for introducing new foods or offering small amounts of sweets. Lunches dont have to be complicated. You can simply target four items in lunch: a protein food such as meat, eggs, nut butter or beans; a fruit or vegetable; whole grains, such as whole-wheat bread, whole-grain crackers, pasta or a bagel; and a dairy food, such as cheese, yogurt or milk, which could also serve as a protein source, said Jill Castle, pediatric dietitian and creator of The Nourished Child, a nutrition education website for parents. Selecting foods from these groups also helps ensure that nutrition needs are met, since children need protein for growth and focus during school, healthy carbohydrates for sustained energy, healthy fats for brain development and dairy or other calcium-rich foods for strong bones and teeth. Since schooling from home doesnt take as long as going in-person, you can use the extra time to add an important life skill to your childs curriculum  cooking in the kitchen! said Lisa Leake, author of 100 Days of Real Food. Its not only a wonderful learning experience, but a great confidence booster as well! It can be empowering for the kids to make lunch without a lot of support from mom and dad, Feltman agreed. And heres a bonus: Children are more likely to eat nutritious meals if they play a role in creating them. When planning lunches, allow your kids to suggest ideas and shop for foods, even if you are purchasing foods online. Ask them to select breads and rolls, vegetables, fruits and spreads. If its an option, take your kids to the farmers market and let them pick out fruits and vegetables, Feltman said. You can then serve vegetables with a favorite dip or sauce like apples with sunflower seed butter, carrots with hummus or bell peppers with guacamole. When it comes to prepping lunches, children as young as 4 years old can spread cream cheese or a nut or nut-free butter on bread and mash tuna or hard-boiled eggs for egg salad, explained Jessica Levinson, a registered dietitian nutritionist and culinary nutrition expert in Westchester, New York. Kids can also mix ingredients for salads, tear lettuce leaves for sandwiches and wash fruits and vegetables. Older kids can help cut up vegetables, make a big pot of grains or bake breads and muffins, Feltman said. Make the assembly easy: If you are planning a peanut butter and jelly sandwich but your child is past the lunch box stage and prefers to create lunches in real time, place all ingredients  jars, bread and a plastic knife (if necessary)  out on the counter so he or she can quickly assemble it if you are busy working. Similarly, if a salad is on the lunch menu, put ingredients like chopped tomatoes, broccoli, chickpeas, shredded cheese and pasta in prep bowls and leave the dressing within reach in the refrigerator. If you are around to help, this can be a wonderful time to spark a conversation about the nutrients that lunch provides. Theres nothing like hands-on food assembly to engage children and make teachable moments about food and nutrition come alive, Castle said. She likes serving DIY pizza, tacos or sandwiches for a change of pace. The key to making school lunches easy, according to Leake, is to make lunch foods in advance and freeze them. Some ideas include homemade whole-grain muffins, burritos, chicken nuggets, smoothies, grilled sandwiches, soups or stews (which you can freeze in individual portions), pancakes, waffles, quick breads, and more (note: for specific ideas/instructions click here). Simply make one recipe each weekend, consider doubling things you know they will love, and keep on hand in the freezer for when its time to pack lunch. Then, the night before, simply take out one premade item to defrost and pack it in the fridge along with some fresh produce and other simple additions. Lunchtime is a great opportunity to be creative with food! Try making food faces and use cookie or sandwich cutters in the shapes of animals, ballerinas, sports items, butterflies, hearts and stars. Kabobs, like colorful fruit kebobs or tomato and cheese kabobs, can reinforce pattern making. Leake suggested adding fun toothpicks and cute notes, which can be premade or handwritten. When lunch is fun, kids look forward to it, Castle said. Castle recommended using themed lunches for different days of the week, like a Monday Munch Lunch, with cheese or peanut butter and crackers, baby carrots and dip, nuts and dried or fresh fruit, all served on a large platter, or Friday Favorites Lunch where the kids decide the menu, or a dessert is included. Feltman liked school favorites such as Breakfast for Lunch, Make Your Own Taco Bar and Pizza Day. Lunch is a great opportunity to repurpose leftovers from dinner the night before, both at home and school, Feltman said. Eating leftovers for lunch also results in less food waste. Simply roll up the ingredients of last nights protein with veggies into a wrap, tortilla or taco. You can also use leftover rotisserie chicken, turkey or fish for sandwiches or salads. For lists of various lunch items, check out Leakes school lunch packing chart. Ask (kids) to check off what looks good to them and that theyll actually eat, Leake said. Remember to use the weekends to prepare lunch items. Levinson often makes a batch of her egg muffins and quinoa and veggie bites for her daughters lunches.

MacKenzie Scott has become the world? richest woman,"MacKenzie Scott  philanthropist, author and ex-wife of Amazon (AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos  is now the wealthiest woman in the world. Scotts net worth is now $68 billion, propelling her past LOreal heiress Francoise Bettencourt Meyers, according to Bloombergs Billionaire index. Scott received a quarter of Bezos Amazon shares in the couples divorce settlement in 2019. That equated to a 4% stake that was worth more than $35 billion at the time. She is now the 12th wealthiest person in the world. In July, Scott announced that she had already donated nearly $1.7 billion to 116 organizations that included four historically Black colleges and universities. She described the organizations as focusing on one of nine areas of need ranging from racial equity to climate change. Last year, Scott also signed onto the Giving Pledge initiative, founded by Warren Buffett and Bill and Melinda Gates. The initiative encourages the worlds richest people to dedicate a majority of their wealth to charitable causes. Bezos, the worlds richest man, hasnt signed the pledge, according to a list of signatories. Amazons stock jumped roughly 28% over the last three months, and is up more than 90% so far this year, according to data from Refinitiv. The soar in shares increased the wealth of Bezos to over $200 billion. Scotts bump up in wealth follows a surge in tech stock gains, which has led to other billionaire ranking shake ups at the top. Earlier this week, Elon Musk surpassed Mark Zuckerberg to become the third richest person in the world. Tesla saw a 12% stock gain after Teslas 5-1 stock split on Monday.",03/09/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/02/business/mackenzie-scott-worlds-richest-woman/index.html
Summer 2020? Arctic wildfires set new emission records,"Wildfires raging in the Arctic Circle smashed last years records for carbon dioxide emissions, according to scientists at the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS). Using CAMS Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS) data, scientists estimated that CO2 emissions from fires in the Arctic Circle have increased by more than a third, compared to 2019, with 244 megatonnes of carbon produced from January 1 to August 31, 2020. By comparison, 181 megatonnes of carbon were produced for the whole of 2019. Most of the increased wildfire activity took place in Russias Sakha Republic, scientists said, ravaging millions of acres of land, and causing a spike in CO2 emissions. Last summer we discovered from our data that there was very persistent fire activity in the Arctic circle, particularly in the Siberian Arctic, Mark Parrington, senior scientist at CAMS, part of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, told CNN. Whats been different this year is that we saw through the second half of July and the first couple of weeks of August, a very large cluster of fires burning very far into the Arctic circle and Siberia, he said. Hazardous smoke plumes from the blazes covered an area equivalent to more than a third of Canada, scientists said. The peak of the Arctic fire season was in July and early August, the data showed. Sakha Republic and the remote Russian Chukotka region saw above average daily total wildfire intensity in August. Fires in the Eastern Federal District of Russia between June and August emitted approximately 540 megatonnes of carbon dioxide  overtaking the previous total highest emissions dataset, recorded in 2003. Though experts said the fires ignition sources were uncertain, some fires earlier in the season are thought to have been so-called zombie fires  blazes also known as holdover fires  which can burn at low temperatures underground, and could have been alight during the winter. The fires are a symptom of how the climate and the environment are changing in the Arctic, Parrington said. Weve known for quite a few years now that the rate of change of temperature and climate variables in the high northern latitude is faster  two to three times faster  than the global average, he said. What were seeing now is that these fires are symptomatic of that: Its warmer, dryer, so the vegetation and fuel is in the right conditions, and so when these fires are being ignited, they are able to burn for a long period of time uninterrupted, and grow as well, he said. Depending on the meteorology at the time, the huge amount of smoke and pollution that these fires produce doesnt necessarily stay there  it is subject to long range transport, Parrington added. This could prove hazardous to both local populations and those further afield: Wildfire smoke contains a number of pollutants including carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, and solid aerosol particles. You can see smoke heading out across the Arctic Ocean, you can see it heading out to North America, Parrington said. Pollution and smoke doesnt know about international boundaries, those fires can affect a much larger population, thousands of kilometers away, he added. The Arctic Circle is not alone in experiencing problem wildfires  CAMS noted that a large portion of the southwestern United States has been ravaged by wildfires because of heatwave conditions, with California experiencing widespread fire activity. The fires, mostly situated in California and Colorado, are thought to have been caused by lightning, according to the monitoring service. Meanwhile, large plumes of smoke have been observed moving eastward across the Great Lakes, towards the North Atlantic.",03/09/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/03/world/arctic-wildfires-climate-intl/index.html
Jake Auchincloss wins Democratic primary for Kennedy? House seat in Massachusetts,"Jake Auchincloss, a 32-year-old formerly registered Republican, won a tough nine-way Democratic primary to likely succeed the outgoing Massachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy. The Marine veteran and Newton city councilor ran as an Obama-Baker Democrat, referring to the former president and current popular Republican Gov. Charlie Baker, describing himself as someone who could lead during a time of crisis. He beat, among others, Jesse Mermell, a progressive Democrat endorsed by Rep. Ayanna Pressley and the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, and overcame the opposition of a group affiliated with EMILYs List, which aims to elect women supportive of abortion rights. Mermell and other top contenders conceded the race after Tuesdays vote. The seat for the district, which includes parts of the Boston suburbs and southern Massachusetts, became open after Kennedy launched a primary campaign against Democratic Sen. Ed Markey. The senator won on Tuesday by positioning himself as the progressive champion. But the states 4th Congressional District went with Auchincloss over more liberal challengers like Mermell, who supports single-payer health care and the Green New Deal. Auchincloss supports a public health care option and other measures to address climate change. He received The Boston Globes endorsement after saying he would prioritize federal relief for local budgets to help the state provide education services and improve its infrastructure. The race was marked not only by the top two candidates ideological clash but also by the difficulties of voting during the coronavirus pandemic. Debra OMalley, spokesperson for Massachusetts Secretary of State Bill Galvin, told CNN more than 3,000 ballots were not initially counted, which potentially could have changed the outcome of the race. OMalley said that the majority ballots that were found, from Franklin, went uncounted due to an oversight of the Franklin town clerk. She said the secretary of states office will be heavily involved in many towns to make sure it doesnt happen again. The other ballots that the secretarys office found, from Newton and Wellesley, hadnt been counted because they came from dropboxes where voters were submitted ballots at the last minute, according to OMalley, and which werent sent to be counted in time. Massachusetts law was changed to allow votes to be counted up to three days after Election Day in November, but that change didnt take effect in time for the primary. As a result, the secretary of states office secured a court order that allowed those ballots found to be counted after Election Day. OMalley said that the ballots did not change the order of the candidates, and Auchincloss opponents have conceded, but said her office will be heavily involved in many towns to make sure it doesnt happen again this fall. In Mermells concession on Friday, she congratulated Auchincloss on his victory. Auchincloss thanked her and tweeted that Democrats must unite to defeat Republican Julie Hall in the fall. We must rally behind Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to defeat the Trump agenda and get to work rebuilding this country: its institutions, its confidence, and its commitment to justice, tweeted Auchincloss on Friday. That work starts here at home. Theres much to be done across our district, and it should begin by focusing on an inclusive and equitable economic recovery for all of the Massachusetts Fourth. We must leave no one behind.",04/09/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/04/politics/jake-auchincloss-massachusetts-kennedy/index.html
Massive mystery holes appear in Siberian tundra ?and could be linked to climate change,"A Russian TV crew flying over the Siberian tundra this summer spotted a massive crater 30 meters (100 feet) deep and 20 meters wide  striking in its size, symmetry and the explosive force of nature that it must have taken to have created it. Scientists are not sure exactly how the huge hole, which is at least the ninth spotted in the region since 2013, formed. Initial theories floated when the first crater was discovered near an oil and gas field in the Yamal Peninsula in northwest Siberia included a meteorite impact, a UFO landing and the collapse of a secret underground military storage facility. While scientists now believe the giant hole is linked to an explosive buildup of methane gas  which could be an unsettling result of warming temperatures in the region  there is still a lot the researchers dont know. Right now, there is no single accepted theory on how these complex phenomena are formed, said Evgeny Chuvilin, lead research scientist at the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technologys Center for Hydrocarbon Recovery, who has visited the site of the newest crater to study its features. It is possible they have been forming for years, but it is hard to estimate the numbers. Since craters usually appear in uninhabited and largely pristine areas of the Arctic, there is often no one to see and report them, Chuvilin said. Even now, craters are mostly found by accident during routine, non-scientific helicopter flights or by reindeer herders and hunters. Permafrost, which amounts to two-thirds of the Russian territory, is a huge natural reservoir of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, and recent hot summers, including in 2020, in the region may have played a role in creating these craters. Chuvilin and his team are among the few scientists who have been down inside one of these craters to investigate how it formed and where the gas that causes them comes from. Accessing the craters has to be done with climbing gear and there is a limited window  the craters turn into lakes within two years of being formed. The scientists took samples of permafrost soil, ground and ice from the rim of a hole  known as the Erkuta crater  during a field trip in 2017 after it was discovered by biologists who were in the area observing falcon nesting. The researchers conducted drone observations six months later. The main issue with these craters is how incredibly fast, geologically, they form and how short-lived they are before they turn into lakes, Chuvilin said. Finding one in the remote Arctic is always a stroke of luck for scientists. The study, which was published in June, showed that gases, mostly methane, can accumulate in the upper layers of permafrost from multiple sources  both from the deep layers of the Earth and closer to the surface. The accumulation of these gases can create pressure that is strong enough to burst through the upper layers of frozen ground, scattering earth and rocks and creating the crater. We want to stress that the studies of this crater problem are in a very early stage, and each new crater leads to new research and discoveries, he said. With the Erkuta crater, the scientists model suggested that it formed in a dried-up lake that probably had something called an underlake talik  a zone of unfrozen soils that started freezing gradually after the lake had dried out, building up the stress that was ultimately released in a powerful explosion  a type of ice volcano. Cryovolcanism, as some researchers call it, is a very poorly studied and described process in the cryosphere, an explosion involving rocks, ice, water and gases that leaves behind a crater. It is a potential threat to human activity in the Arctic, and we need to thoroughly study how gases, especially methane, are accumulated in the top layers of the permafrost and which conditions can cause the situation to go extreme, Chuvilin noted. Cryosphere refers to portions of Earths surface where water is in solid form  ice. These methane emissions also contribute to the rising concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and climate change itself might be a factor in increasing cryovolcanism. But this is still something that needs to be researched, Chuvilin said. He said his team will publish more detailed information on the newest crater shortly in a scientific journal. He added its one of the biggest found so far. Marina Leibman, a Russian permafrost expert at the Earth Cryosphere Institute at the Russian Academy of Sciences, was part of a team of researchers who have analyzed five gas emission craters using remote sensing data and field surveys. The researchers found the craters shared some similar features, most notably a 2- to 6-meter-high mound that formed before the explosion. The craters were all also located on gentle slopes and had a lower portion that was cylindrical like a can before opening into a funnel, with the opening diameter around 20 to 25 meters wide. The explosions all ejected ground ice, which in some cases leaves holes where huge frozen blocks have fallen on the surface. Leibman believed that extremely hot summers in the region in 2012 and 2016, and again this year, may have played a role in the growth and blowout of these mounds. The mounds appear and explode within as a little as three to five years. The release of methane from permafrost ... is likely caused by rising air and ground temperature over the past decades. The formation of all GECs (gas emission craters) was preceded by anomalously warm summers, the study, which published in July this year, said. She said the methane accumulates in a feature known as a cryopeg  a layer of unfrozen ground that never freezes because of its salt content below a table of ground ice  and acts as a trap. The gas then escapes, deforming the ice and earth, to form a mound. And when heat struck during a warm summer, the mounds blew out, creating the spectacular craters. Leibman believed the craters are likely unique to this area of the Arctic because few other areas share the features she thinks are necessary for the holes to form  a combination of table-like ground ice close to the surface, continuous permafrost saturated with methane, and unfrozen ground with saline deposits below the ice. None of these features have been discovered or reported in the Alaskan or Canadian arctic, according to Susan Natali, the Arctic program director at the Woodwell Climate Research Center, who is using satellite data to try to identify and map craters that havent been seen with human eyes. The ones that have been found are all in this one region of Siberia  the Yamal and Gyda peninsulas, she said. When Natali first heard about these craters, she noted, It seemed liked such a crazy thing but sure enough theyre real. People havent seen that many but theyre happening and they continue to happen. Very few people have witnessed any of these explosions take place, but they do pose a risk to the people who live in these remote regions and oil and gas infrastructure, said Vasily Bogoyavlensky, a professor at the Oil and Gas Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences. He spoke to a reindeer herder who witnessed a massive explosion of a mound on a river channel in the Yamal Peninsula in 2017. Every morning she was going to this small frost mound in the river because it was the highest place and she was looking where her reindeer were, and this morning when the explosion happened she came again and she started to feel something in her legs and she was afraid of it and she ran. When she was in the distance  200 or 300 meters there was an explosion. She could have been killed, he said. Other craters have formed less than 3 kilometers from railways and an oil pipeline, he added. Bogoyavlensky isnt convinced that the primary cause of these craters is warming temperatures linked to climate change. Villages and herding communities he has spoken to have told him that older generations have shared stories of explosions creating craters in the tundra. He said that the main input is gas trying to move to the surface from deep layers of the Earth. Leibman said her team has conducted laboratory tests on methane from some of the craters and she doesnt think the gas is coming from deep within the ground. Our team and others did laboratory tests of the methane from the crater. Its isotope composition proves that this methane did not come from the deep sources, she said in an email. It is hard to exclude air temperature extremes because the first set of craters appeared after (the) 2012 extreme (summer), the other one after the 2016 extreme and the newest after (the) 2020 extreme. Nothing in between, she added. Likewise, Natali said she believed climate change plays a role  although more data is needed to say definitively. Theres been a series of anomalously warm summers in the Arctic. You can imagine that weakening the permafrost layer. Think of it like a cap, if youre thawing this cap, its making the cap a little bit looser, promoting the ability of the ground to explode, she said. Its like with hurricanes. It took a long time for scientists and papers to come out to say yes, climate change is causing hurricane storms to be stronger. Theres so few of these holes so it might be tricky to say for certain, but Im pretty confident climate change is playing a role in this.",04/09/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/04/world/craters-tundra-siberia-trnd-scn/index.html
How an American who lost his job due to Covid-19 got roped into an apparent Russian plot to meddle in American life,"Jack Delaney, an aspiring writer living in Brooklyn, New York, had his world turned upside down on Tuesday, when the 26-year-old found himself at the center of an apparent Russian plot to covertly insert itself into the American national conversation. It all began in July when Delaney received a private message on Twitter from Alex Lacusta, who introduced himself as an editor with Peace Data, an independent leftwing online magazine. The editor said he had seen some of Delaneys pieces on other independent, mostly left-leaning sites and wanted to offer him a regular, paid column. Delaney, who had lost his day-job at a restaurant early in the Covid-19 pandemic, thought this could be his big break. He began writing for the site, producing three articles over a few months for $100 a piece. His articles could have appeared on any independent leftwing site, with headlines including QAnon Is Meant to Spread Fascist Mythology and Distract From U.S. Failures and Overfunding of U.S. Military Is Driving Climate Change and White Supremacist Culture of War Crimes. But Peace Data and Alex Lacusta were not what they presented themselves to be. On Tuesday, Facebook, acting on a tip from the FBI, said Peace Data was part of a covert Russian campaign  tied to the same Russian group that used social media to interfere in the 2016 US presidential election. In a post on the website after Facebooks announcement, Peace Data maintained it was an independent site and disputed the companys findings. The Russian government has not commented. The smiling man in Lacustas profile picture on Twitter, the account that had offered Delaney work, did not exist, according to experts. Though realistic looking, the picture was computer-generated, using new artificial intelligence techniques. Peace Data had recruited and paid Americans to write stories on a host of issues, including American politics and racial inequality in the US. While it has a modern, digital twist, the scheme comes straight from a playbook Russia has been using since at least the Cold War: tap unwitting Americans to help highlight cracks in American society and elevate dissenting voices. Its all part of a campaign the US government says is designed to exacerbate divisions in American life. Delaney, and others like him, are by all accounts acting in good faith, simply writing articles and opinion pieces they would for any other outlet. Voices that challenge conventional wisdom are all good things, says Delaney, but not at the behest of a foreign (or any) government. The writer was shocked, appalled, and embarrassed on Tuesday when he came to the realization he had been co-opted by an apparent Russian influence operation. Im obviously no fan of Putin or the Russian government, he told CNN in an interview on Thursday. I dont want to have any association with an authoritarian regime. Delaney wasnt the only one  some other Americans were also unwittingly coopted to write for the website. In 2016, the same Russian troll group that Facebook said was tied to Peace Data, ran a network of fake sites and social media accounts posing as everything from Black Lives Matter activists to pro-Second Amendment groups. CNN has previously documented how, as part of that effort, unwitting Americans were recruited to organize protests and stage stunts. Special Counsel Robert Muellers investigation in 2018 identified the persona Alice Donovan as being run by the GRU, Russian military intelligence. The persona was used to plant articles in a real US publication, the independent leftwing magazine CounterPunch. CounterPunchs managing editor Joshua Frank outlined at the time how his publication had been duped. And it appears CounterPunch remains a target of Russian influence operations. Frank shared emails with CNN this week that had been sent over the past few months to CounterPunch from Alex Lacusta. The person posing as Lacusta pitched all three of Delaneys stories to CounterPunch, in an apparent attempt to have a real American publication publish Russian-commissioned pieces written by real Americans. We would really appreciate if you could share this story on your platform. Looking forward to your reply and fruitful cooperation, one email read. CounterPunch did not run the pieces. Frank told CNN Wednesday, This sort of thing ultimately hurts real journalists caught up in it and independent media more broadly, especially outlets that are critical of the United States government, by casting doubt about our authenticity. Delaney, meanwhile, is hoping hell be able to find work with a genuine publication. Im more mad at myself for letting this happen than at Vladimir Putin or Russia or anything like I should have, I should have my guard up a little bit more, he said.",04/09/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/04/tech/covid-19-american-russian-plan/index.html
Extinction Rebellion climate protesters arrested after blocking printing of Murdoch-owned British newspapers,"UK police have arrested 13 members of the Extinction Rebellion group after climate change protesters blocked the printing presses of several Rupert Murdoch-owned News Corp newspapers on Friday and Saturday, disrupting their distribution. The protest is causing major disruption to local businesses. At this time, 13 people have been arrested in connection with the incident, and we anticipate more arrests will be made, Hertfordshire police said in a statement. Member of Extinction Rebellion, also known as XR, blocked printworks responsible for printing papers such as News Corps The Sun and The Times, along with The Daily Mail, published by Associated Newspapers in Broxbourne, greater London and in Liverpool. The groups are using disruption to expose the failure of these corporations to accurately report on the climate and ecological emergency, and their consistent manipulation of the truth to suit their own personal and political agendas, XR said in a statement. XR said its activists targeted the newspapers owned by media mogul Rupert Murdoch because the right-wing media is a barrier to the truth, failing to reflect the scale and urgency of the climate crisis. They distract us with hate and maintain their own power and wealth, profiting from our division. We cant move forward until this barrier falls, the group added. The Times newspapers said on Twitter: We apologize to readers who may be unable to buy their usual newspaper this morning. Overnight printing of The Times was disrupted by Extinction Rebellion alongside other newspapers. We are working to get newspapers delivered to retailers as soon as possible. Prime Minister Boris Johnson also criticized the protests, writing on Twitter: A free press is vital in holding the government and other powerful institutions to account on issues critical for the future of our country, including the fight against climate change. It is completely unacceptable to seek to limit the publics access to news in this way, he said. Murdochs son, James, this year lashed out against his fathers sprawling media empire for how it covers the climate crisis. In comments made to The Daily Beast, a spokesperson for James Murdoch and his wife spoke of the couples frustration with News Corp coverage of climate. James Murdoch later broke from the family business in July and said he was exiting the company over disagreements over certain editorial content published by its news outlets and certain other strategic decisions. Murdochs News Corp owns a large chunk of Australias media and has been criticized for coverage that suggested recent wildfires were no worse than theyd been in the past or that they are caused by arsonists, not climate change. The News Corp umbrella includes papers such as The Wall Street Journal and New York Post, a raft of newspapers in the United Kingdom and Australia, and the book publisher HarperCollins.",05/09/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/05/media/extinction-rebellion-xr-newspaper-protest-intl-scli-gbr/index.html
"Uber says it will offer rides only in electric vehicles in US, Europe by 2030","Uber plans to offer rides exclusively in electric vehicles by 2030 in US, Canadian and European cities, and be entirely free of emissions by 2040. Ubers announcement related to the climate crisis came as it also released a report that acknowledged its vehicles are less climate efficient than the average vehicle. Uber said the carbon intensity, which it defines as the emissions resulting from every passenger mile, of its rides are 41% higher than an average-occupancy vehicle. Uber trips have more mileage than traditional trips as drivers must first drive to pick up their passengers. A 2019 California government report found that ridehail vehicles only have a passenger for about 61% of miles traveled. A 2020 study by the Union of Concerned Scientists found that ridehailing services generated 69% more emissions than the trips they aimed to replace. Climate changes remains an existential threat and crisis that needs every person, every business and every nation to act, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said. We know this is going to be hard. Transportation is the largest source of US emissions. Today, only 0.15% of Uber trips are taken in electric vehicles. Electric cars are cheaper to operate than gas-powered vehicles, but can cost 50% more than a gasoline-fueled car to purchase upfront. Electric vehicles were 2.5% of the global light vehicle market in 2019. Ubers announcement comes nearly three months after its rival Lyft pledged to offer only electric vehicle rides in 2030. Some experts have cautioned that the timeline is optimistic for ridehailing corporations. Charging infrastructure for electric vehicles is also an issue. Many drivers live in multi-unit dwellings and do not have a garage, according to Shin-pei Tsay, director of policy, cities and transportation at Uber. Setting up public charging infrastructure in more residential neighborhoods is something that when the [Uber] team talked to drivers, they were really interested in, Tsay said. The shift to electric vehicles will increase costs for Uber riders, as theyll cover some of the increased costs from the transition to electric vehicles. Uber says it will take steps to ease drivers transition to electric vehicles. In the US and Canada, drivers with electric vehicles with now receive an extra $1.50 per trip, Uber said, with $0.50 cents coming directly from the passenger. Drivers of hybrids will receive an extra $0.50 per trip. Uber also said it would work with automakers to give drivers discounts on electric vehicles. Uber said in a Europe-focused report that it released Tuesday, that many drivers would face a significant earnings reduction unless they have access to a home charger and a generous subsidy to close the gap for the total cost of owning an electric vehicle. Theres a lack of affordable and second-hand electric cars, the report said. The price gap between a used gas-powered car and a new electric vehicle can be up to 30,000 euros, according to the report. Uber is expanding a feature that allows users to request a ride in an electric vehicle. Uber says the option is available in 37 European cities already and will be in 60 global markets by years end, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego, Chicago, Denver, Seattle and Toronto. Ubers goal to be zero-emission by 2040 comes nearly a year after Amazon made a similar pledge, and this past July Apple announced that it planned to be entirely carbon neutral by 2030.",08/09/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/08/tech/uber-climate-change/index.html
California? wildfires show how climate change is making forced evacuations and power shut-offs the norm,"Dozens of campers were packed shoulder to shoulder, leaving behind their belongings to be airlifted from the very place that had offered a serene escape. Californias Sierra National Forest was quickly becoming surrounded by raging fires when helicopters arrived to airlift hundreds of people over the holiday weekend. From a scenic retreat to an urgent recovery mission, the contrast is a stark reminder climate change is upending life in the nations most populous state. This time last year, California saw 4,927 fires that burned 118,000 acres, Gov. Gavin Newsom said. In 2020, there have been 7,606 blazes thus far. Wildfires are a big part of the seasonal challenge, Newsom said. The challenge were facing now is the extreme fire events that we believe are climate induced. Newsom has pointed directly at climate change as the source of the extreme heat wave and a primary factor in the scores of wildfires plaguing California. The effects have been painfully felt. At least seven people have died since the start of this years fire season, according to Cal Fire, with thousands of homes reduced to embers. Many communities have had to order mandatory evacuations, and more than 170,000 recently went without power to prevent future blazes. The state has seen a record of more than 2.2 million acres scorched so far this year, Cal Fire announced Tuesday. And officials warn many of those fires will burn uncontrollably until the weather changes. Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA and the National Center for Atmospheric Research, told CNN it is shocking to the see the impacts of the wildfires in the Western US, but not scientifically surprising. Swain explained that due to human-caused climate change, temperature extremes are climbing higher and the vegetation is drier, which affects fire behavior. But climate change has not just made the extreme heat waves that coincided with the fires worse. The bigger effect is the more subtle, long-term warming, he said. That couple of degrees of (average) warming over decades ... you dont notice it as much, but its still there lurking in the background, sucking extra moisture out of the vegetation and the soil. Since the 1970s, California wildfires have increased in size by eight times, and the annual area burned by fires has increased by nearly 500%, according to CNN meteorologist Robert Shackelford. Now, people across California wake up daily to red-flag warnings that signal conditions are ripe for fire danger. Swain doesnt expect current conditions to improve soon for California and other Western states battling blazes. The heart of the fire season is yet to come for the most populated part of California, he cautioned. Until widespread precipitation falls on the West Coast  of which theres currently no sign at all and in a typical year, wouldnt be expected for another one to two months  conditions are going to continue to be really extreme. I dont see much of a let up.",09/09/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/09/us/california-wildfires-climate-change/index.html
"Human activity has wiped out two-thirds of world? wildlife since 1970, landmark report says","The worlds wildlife populations have fallen by an average of 68% in just over four decades, with human consumption behind the devastating decline, the World Wildlife Fund warned in a new report released Wednesday. The Living Planet Report 2020 assessed the population declines seen in more than 4,392 monitored species of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles and amphibians between 1970 and 2016. The report says that the kinds of steep wildlife population decreases the Earth has seen in recent decades have not been seen for millions of years. The regions of Latin America and the Caribbean are the worlds worst-affected areas, with an average drop of 94%, the report said. The conversion of grassland, savannah, forest and wetland habitats, the overexploitation of wildlife, the introduction of non-native species and climate change are the key drivers of the drop. Humans have significantly altered a staggering 75% of the planets ice-free land surface, the authors say. And according to WWF, ecosystem destruction now threatens some 1 million species  500,000 animals and plants and 500,000 insects  with extinction in the coming decades and centuries. But while the report finds that nature is being destroyed by us at a rate unprecedented in history, experts say the declining trends can be halted and even reversed with urgent action, such as transforming how we produce and consume food, tackling climate change and conserving nature. Experts say that freshwater biodiversity is declining fastest, with data showing that 85% of global wetlands have been lost since the Industrial Revolution. The populations of freshwater mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and fishes monitored have fallen by an average of 4% each year since 1970, the report found. The most dramatic decline was in freshwater, Rebecca Shaw, chief scientist at WWF, explained. You begin to see a picture of an unraveling of nature. That is alarming  and I think alarming, even by our own measures of alarming  we really thought with the efforts that were going on, that we would see change in the direction. But still, were seeing very distinct declines in freshwater ecosystems, largely because of the way we dam rivers and also because of the use of freshwater resources for producing food to feed a growing population of people worldwide, she said. Researchers say that human activity is the main driver of population decline. To feed and fuel our 21st century lifestyles, we are overusing the Earths biocapacity by at least 56%, the report authors noted. Shaw told CNN that population decline is indicative of the planets ability to support life. We often focus on species that are in big trouble, or on the edge of extinction, but by the time the species gets there, it no longer is serving its ecological function, Shaw explained. The main driver of species decline is the habitat destruction that comes from agriculture, expanding agricultural production, to produce food, Shaw told CNN. The WWF warns that this biodiversity loss threatens the worlds food security. Experts say that while climate change is not yet the biggest cause of biodiversity loss, in the coming years, climate change will become a key driver of species decline unless world leaders take action. Scientists also warned that the further destruction of the planet would spell disaster for humans. This report reminds us that we destroy the planet at our peril  because it is our home. As humanitys footprint expands into once-wild places, were devastating species populations. But were also exacerbating climate change and increasing the risk of zoonotic diseases like Covid-19, WWF-US President and CEO Carter Roberts said in a statement. Zoonotic diseases are ones that jump from animals to humans. We are destroying rainforests to convert the land to cropland to feed a growing planet and the growing demand for food, in general, and animal protein, in particular, Shaw said. In the process of deforestation and forest fragmentation for food production, we are opening up more and more tropical forests to the poaching of its animals for sale in a worldwide market  and with this is we are exposing ourselves to a dizzying array of new diseases, she added. The longer the wildlife stay in supply chains with other humans and people, the greater the risk of spillover of a wildlife disease to humans. We are playing Russian Roulette with the threat of pandemics and in the end we will lose ... big. And Covid-19 is only the beginning, she said.",09/09/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/09/world/wwf-report-species-decline-climate-scn-intl-scli/index.html
The solar fridge helping African entrepreneurs living off the grid,"Keeping food fresh without refrigeration is near impossible in the scorching climate of sub-Saharan Africa. But its hard to power fridges in a region where almost 600 million people live off the grid. Thats where Brazils Youmma comes in. The company has developed a pay-as-you-go solar-powered fridge that is being snapped up by small business owners. The fridges help to reduce food waste, store medication safely, and allow shops to keep products fresh for longer, says Andre Morriesen, research and development manager at Nidec Global Appliance, which owns Youmma. Of about 2,000 fridges sold since Youmma launched it in 2019, around 80% were to small businesses, he adds. The cooling system of the small 100-liter fridge has been designed for off-grid use, and it consumes a quarter of the energy of a regular fridge, according to Nidec. That means it can be powered by a smaller solar panel and a smaller battery, reducing costs. The battery can keep the fridge running for a day and a half without sunlight. Customers pay for the fridge in daily installments via cell phones, through M-Kopa, a Kenyan solar energy company. New M-Kopa customers pay a $100 deposit. Daily payments range from $1 to $1.50 for a package that includes solar lighting and covers the installation of a rooftop solar panel. If a user doesnt pay, the fridge stops working until they do. Once it has been paid off  which usually takes around two years  the customer owns the fridge and the solar power system outright. M-Kopa says it costs more than a conventional fridge, but the package includes lighting as well as continued access to free off-the-grid energy. Pay-as-you-go is useful for [rural] households or businesses with an uneven cash flow, such as income based on harvesting seasons, says Teresa Le, a climate change and energy specialist for the UN Development Program. However, even when paired with pay-as-you-go systems like M-Kopas, solar fridges are still costly for the average person and thats why they mostly appeal to small businesses, says Le. Kioko Mwange runs a small shop in the village of Kithungo, eastern Kenya. Since signing up for the Youmma fridge he has increased his sales, which is offsetting the daily payments. It helps me preserve milk for up to 10 days, says Mwange. I have seen an increase in customers, and they are now confident about the quality of the milk I sell them. Although other affordable options for solar-powered cold storage are available in sub-Saharan Africa, these tend to be larger shared fridges  such as Nigerias Cold Hubs and Kenyas Solar Freeze  and are mainly used to store produce after harvest or at markets. Le is confident the market for solar fridges will grow as distribution networks and pay-as-you-go systems improve. Morriesen believes the fridges can be a life-changing product for rural families and bring freedom to women who often spend hours each day walking to food markets. With a refrigerator, they can bulk buy ingredients, saving them time and money, he says. Youmma sells fridges in Uganda and Kenya, and it is looking to expand into Nigeria, Tanzania, Zambia, Ivory Coast and Senegal.",09/09/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/09/business/solar-fridge-youmma-africa-spc-intl/index.html
Does it matter to voters if Trump insults the military?,"Surprise! Donald Trump has a credibility problem. The US President is still raging about an article in The Atlantic that said he had skipped a trip to a World War I cemetery in France because he was afraid rain might mess up his hair. But claims that he called dead US soldiers losers and suckers sound exactly like the kind of thing he would say  and after making more than 20,000 false or misleading claims in office, his denials are cheap. CNN has corroborated some aspects of the story, including that the President spoke in derogatory terms about US soldiers who had been killed. His loyalists, like former spokeswoman Sarah Sanders, are taking to TV to defend the President  but theyve got their own credibility issues. Sanders, for example, has already admitted lying to the press. Officials and retired military brass who do have the gravitas to absolve Trump, like former White House chief of staff Gen. John Kelly, who lost a son in Afghanistan, have been pointedly silent. It wouldnt be the first time that the 45th President, who skipped out of serving in the Vietnam War due to bone spurs, spurned American soldiers and even war heroes. His life in business and politics shows no ethos for public service and self-sacrifice, which is why parts of the Atlantic story ring so true: At Arlington National Cemetery outside Washington, where more than 400,000 former service personnel are interred, Trump reportedly told Kelly, I dont get it. What was in it for them? at his son Roberts grave. But what does this mean for the election? Its hard to believe anyone in America is still undecided about whether Trumps character quirks will sway their vote. Certainly, his fans will pass off the story as more fake news. But Trump is trailing Joe Biden and with tens of millions of veterans and military families across the country, insulting the armed forces could hurt his chances in swing states, where a few thousand votes could decide the fate of the presidency. And remember: Trump isnt just running to be President  he will also be Americas commander in chief if he wins a second term. In that case, hell have some repair work to do across the river at the Pentagon. White supremacists are expected to be the greatest violent threat to America through the next year, according to a draft assessment by the Department of Homeland Security, first published by Lawfare. CNNs Geneva Sands reports that the reports lead section on terrorism was changed in two later drafts to replace white supremacist extremists with Domestic Violent Extremists presenting the most persistent and lethal threat. All drafts, however, contained this language: Among DVEs [Domestic Violent Extremists], we judge that white supremacist extremists (WSEs) will remain the most persistent and lethal threat in the Homeland through 2021. Lawfare editor-in-chief Benjamin Wittes said he published the documents because he wanted to create a record of how the threat was originally assessed, compared with the final draft that will be released. The revelations came as Trump seeks to portray US cities as under siege from looters, anarchists and left wing terrorist mobs. 2020 has been rough everywhere. But Californians have had it tougher than most. The Golden State is beset by two record crises  a once-in-a century pandemic and the worst wildfires ever. Each may be exacerbating the other, and the worst is yet to come: The fires have already torched 2.2 million acres  more than 2% of the state  and peak burn season hasnt even begun. California is hardly well-positioned to order mass evacuations or put citizens in crowded shelters: It has recorded more coronavirus cases than any other state  more than 740,000  and has lost more than 13,700 residents to the virus. But it has little choice  the uncontrolled 80,000-acre Creek Fire has forced the evacuation of an entire town and parts of several communities. In Sierra National Forest, hundreds of people (and their dogs) had to be airlifted in dramatic helicopter rescues. Social distancing cant be the first priority for firefighters, who work in groups and come into contact with many different people. Fighting the fires has also been complicated in many areas by the early release of prisoners to avoid coronavirus transmission in jails  in previous years, inmate firefighting teams were a key force multiplier. California is paying the price for climate change, like Australia earlier this year. Warmer weather, droughts and longer dry seasons mean the vegetation that fuels fires is more prone to bursting into flame, rapid burning and bigger blazes. While Covid-19 will one day be a bad memory, the interwoven threats looming over Californians this summer bode ill for Americas most populous state.",09/09/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/09/world/meanwhile-in-america-september-9-intl/index.html
Antarctica? colossal Thwaites Glacier is melting fast ?and scientists may have discovered why,"Deep channels discovered under the Antarctics so-called Doomsday glacier may be allowing warm ocean water to melt the underside of ice, according to scientists collecting data from an area crucial to understanding sea-level rise. The findings published in The Cryosphere journal show the ocean floor is deeper than previously thought, with more deep channels leading towards the grounding line, where the ice meets the bed. Ice draining from the gigantic Thwaites Glacier into the Amundsen Sea in West Antarctica already accounts for about 4% of global sea-level rise, and scientists say it is highly susceptible to climate change. Over the past three decades, the rate of ice loss from Thwaites, which is about the size of Great Britain or the US state of Florida, and its neighboring glaciers has increased more than five-fold. If Thwaites were to collapse, it could lead to an increase in sea levels of around 25 inches (64 centimeters)  and the researchers are trying to find out how soon this is likely to happen. Scientists from the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration (ITGC) collected data by flying over the glacier in a British Antarctic Survey (BAS) Twin Otter aircraft and mapping the sea floor from the US Antarctic Program icebreaker RV Nathaniel B. Palmer. The cavities hidden beneath the ice shelf are likely to be the route through which warm ocean water passes underneath the ice shelf up to the grounding line, they said. Thwaites Glacier itself is probably one of the most significant glaciers in West Antarctica, because its so large, because we can see its changing today, Dr. Tom Jordan, an aero-geophysicist at BAS who led the airborne survey, told CNN. And also, we know that its bed dips down, and it gets deeper and deeper underneath the ice sheet, which means that, theoretically, you can get a process called marine ice sheet instability. And once it starts to retreat, it will just keep retreating. Jordan said the next phase was to incorporate the data from the channels, some of them 2,600 feet (800 meters) deep, into simulations of how the ice sheet will respond into the future. Before now, he said, the ITGC has not been able to precisely quantify sea-level rise in West Antarctica because there was so much uncertainty about understanding the ice sheet processes and how the glaciers will over time respond. I think this is a big step towards helping understand that, he added. Jordan said that suggestions of geoengineering and blocking the channels is not logistically feasible at such a remote site. A simpler solution would be to tackle climate change. At the end, we will be able to say to governments and policy-makers, this is whats going to happen ... we will actually have a proper, well-constrained estimate of whats going to happen to Thwaites Glacier, said Jordan. Once scientists can demonstrate the expected sea-level rise relating to West Antarctica, he said, they will have more evidence when calling for action to mitigate climate change. The team collected data from the glacier and adjoining Dotson and Crosson ice shelves from January to March 2019. Exceptional sea-ice break up in early 2019 enabled the icebreaker to survey more than 2,000 square kilometers of sea floor at the glaciers ice front. The area surveyed had been hidden beneath part of the floating ice shelf extending from Thwaites Glacier, which broke off in 2002, and was then often inaccessible due to thick sea-ice cover.",09/09/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/09/weather/thwaites-glacier-antarctica-scli-intl/index.html
US report warns climate change could create economic chaos,"The far-reaching consequences of climate change have the ability to create chaos in the financial system and disrupt the American economy, according to a federal report released Wednesday. The report, the first of its kind by a US government entity, calls for Congress to swiftly impose a price on carbon and urges financial regulators to more urgently and decisively work to understand and blunt the looming economic damage from climate change. Climate change poses a major risk to the stability of the U.S. financial system and to its ability to sustain the American economy, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commissions climate subcommittee wrote. The CFTC, which regulates some financial markets, is made up of three Republican and two Democratic commissioners. The climate change advisory committee, launched by Rostin Behnam, a Democratic commissioner, includes representatives from banks, environmental groups, investors and a major oil company. A disclaimer in the report emphasizes that its conclusions do not necessarily reflect the views of the CFTC or the US government. Scientists have already identified climate change as culprit in destructive weather events across the United States, including wildfires, severe floods and massive hurricanes. The report is notable in part because it directly contradicts President Donald Trumps and other Republicans downplaying of the consequences of climate change. The President has called climate change a hoax, rolled back environmental regulations and even falsely claimed that wind mills can cause cancer. Behnam, the Democratic CFTC commissioner, is hoping the broad involvement of industry in Wednesdays report will change the tone from the administration. Its incumbent on policy makers, elected officials and regulators to start building in rules about climate resilience so we dont suffer in the long run from these dramatic weather events, Behnam told CNN Business on Wednesday. These are real world climate events happening on a more frequent basis and more extreme manner. The report warns of potential financial system stress that could hurt the economy by limiting access to credit. Over time, if significant action is not taken to check rising global average temperatures, the report said, climate change impacts could impair the productive capacity of the economy and undermine its ability to generate employment, income, and opportunity. Environmental groups involved in the report stressed the urgent need for action. For such a politically and sectorally diverse group to issue such a strong call for regulatory action is testament to just how serious a systemic financial threat climate change poses to US capital markets, and how concerned stakeholders from across the political spectrum are about it, Mindy Lubber, CEO of sustainability nonprofit Ceres, said in a statement. CFTC Chairman Heath Tarbert, a Republican, struck a different tone on the report, emphasizing the potential disruption caused by the shift to cleaner energy. The subcommittees report acknowledges that transition risks of a green economy could be just as disruptive to our financial system as the possible physical manifestations of climate change, and that moving too fast too soon could be just as disorderly as doing too little too late, Tarbert said in a statement. The report suggests the climate crisis could eventually turn into a financial crisis. Climate change could pose systemic risks to the US financial system, the report said. That could happen through a disorderly repricing of assets that has cascading effects on investment portfolios and balance sheets. And those impacts could be amplified by the fact that Corporate America is sitting on record amounts of debt, which could leave some industries vulnerable to a shock. Another risk is that climate change sparks sub-systemic shocks, the report said, that impact particular sectors and geographical regions. Other reports, outside of the federal government, have similarly warned of dire economic consequences from climate change. In December, the Principles for Responsible Investment warned that climate change  and the policies designed to fight it  could wipe out $2.3 trillion of value from global stocks. Last year, Stanford University researchers found that climate change makes poor countries poorer and widens global inequality. The CFTC climate subcommittee laid out 53 recommendations for dealing with the climate risk, including requiring companies to disclose details on greenhouse gas emissions, piloting climate stress tests, and forcing banks to address climate change financial risks. The report also urged regulators to incorporate climate risks into their mandates  including the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which is charged with identifying emerging threats to financial stability. But the CFTC climate subcommittee emphasized that the single most important step to manage climate risk is for the United States to set a fair, economy-wide and effective price on carbon. The goal would be to steer capital towards clean energy and ensure that markets are appropriately pricing the disruption caused by climate change. Lawmakers and industry leaders have debated a price on carbon, such as a carbon tax, for decades. Even some large fossil fuel companies such as ExxonMobil (XOM) support a carbon tax in hopes of getting clarity on the uncertain regulatory picture. Financial markets today are not pricing climate risk. The financial markets cannot do that on their own, Bob Litterman, chairman of the CFTC climate subcommittee, said in the report. Until this fundamental flaw is fixed, capital will flow in the wrong direction. The report called on Congress to impose a price on carbon and create other appropriate incentives to fight the climate crisis. Only then will the awesome power of the financial system be able to address at scale this existential threat, Litterman said.",09/09/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/09/business/climate-change-economy-cftc-report/index.html
15 states sue Trump administration over Alaskan Arctic oil and gas leasing,"Fifteen states are suing the Bureau of Land Management, its parent agency the Interior Department and Interior Secretary David Bernhardt for opening Alaskas Coastal Plain up to oil and gas leasing in 2017 in what they say is a violation of environmental laws. Defendants insufficient environmental review and Record of Decision that opens the entire Coastal Plain to oil and gas leasing and development are unlawful, the states attorneys general wrote in a filing Wednesday. The move comes after Bernhardt announced plans last month for an oil and gas leasing program in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, clearing the way for drilling in the remote Alaskan area, a long controversial issue. Bernhardt said future leases of the federally owned land will make the entire 1.5 million acre Coastal Plain area available. Interior Department spokesman Conner Swanson told CNN in a statement Wednesday that this is a congressionally mandated energy development program that leaves ninety-two percent of the refuge completely off-limits to development, adding: The lawsuit is politically motivated and meritless, and we will see them in court. The 19 million-acre Arctic National Wildlife Refuge had been closed to oil exploration since 1980 due to concerns about the effect it would have on the regions caribou, polar bears and other animals. But the Trump administrations 2017 law required the department to hold two lease sales in the refuge by 2024. The states of Washington, Massachusetts, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont brought the lawsuit against the bureau on Wednesday. Defendants actions severely underestimate the avoidable and irreparable damage to vital habitat and pristine waters, imperil wildlife already struggling to thrive in a rapidly changing ecosystem, and increase greenhouse gas emissions at a time when our nation and the world drastically need to reduce emissions to mitigate the most extreme harms of climate change, they wrote. Environmental issues were at the forefront of President Donald Trumps agenda this week. He emphasized his environmental accomplishments during an appearance in the battleground state of Florida on Tuesday, even as his administration has worked extensively to dismantle key environmental protections. Trump also signed a moratorium on Tuesday extending an offshore drilling ban for Floridas Gulf Coast, and extended the ban to Floridas Atlantic Coast as well as the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina. Over the past three and a half years, the administration has pulled out of the landmark Paris climate accords, rolled back regulations on carbon emission standards for coal-fired power plants, made the largest reduction in the boundaries of protected land in US history and changed Clean Water Act and Endangered Species Act protections.",09/09/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/09/politics/states-sue-trump-alaska-arctic-oil-gas/index.html
La Ni? has arrived. Here? what it could mean for you,"La Nina is here, which could mean a cold and stormier winter than normal across the North, while the southern tier stays drier, with warmer than average temperatures. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced Thursday the arrival of La Nina, advising that conditions are expected to last through the Northern Hemisphere winter. La Nina, the counterpart of El Nino, is characterized by below-normal sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean near the equator  a result of shifting wind patterns in the atmosphere. Both La Nina and El Nino occur every three to five years on average, according to NOAA. La Ninas arrival could impact weather around the globe, potentially causing more frequent and stronger hurricanes for the last few months of the Atlantic hurricane season. It also can mean wetter conditions for northern Australia, Indonesia and the Philippines, drier conditions for western South America and cooler conditions for western Africa. NOAA issued a La Nina watch in July, warning that La Nina could form in the fall. The agency factored in the likelihood of La Nina forming in its outlook on the 2020 hurricane season, forecasting last month that it would be extremely active. La Nina weakens winds between the ocean surface and the upper levels of the atmosphere, which allows hurricanes to more easily grow. It also impacts the position of the jet stream over North America, which can influence the track and severity of winter storms. This tends to make for wetter and cooler winters along the Pacific Northwest and areas currently facing major wildfires. While El Nino and La Nina events are regular aspects of global weather patterns, increased global temperatures may temper or change their effects. La Nina tends to pull down global temperatures, but in recent years we have been warming the planet so fast, its like hitting a small speed bump at 80 mph  it barely even registers, CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said in July. Its likely too early to know how climate change will affect those patterns; research is beginning to show how a warming climate may amplify the effects of El Nino and La Nina. A 2018 study on atmospheric conditions ran simulations of climate conditions and found that climate change could increase the severity of weather events stemming from El Nino patterns. Outside of any impact on hurricanes, climate change may mean that some older temperature patterns associated with El Nino and La Nina no longer apply. 2020 is already trending as one of the top two warmest years on record. Perhaps a cooling influence from an emerging La Nina will keep it out of the top spot, but will likely still be in the top 3 at least, Miller said. Top spots on the warmest years list used to be reserved for the strong El Nino years, but human influences have long since overwhelmed the planets natural temperature regulators.",10/09/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/10/weather/la-nia-is-here-trnd/index.html
The pressure is off stocks ?for now,"The Nasdaq bounced out of correction territory on Wednesday, led higher by some of the huge tech companies that were hit hardest in the recent sell-off. Microsoft gained 4.3%, Amazon added 3.8% and Apple increased nearly 4%. US futures dipped a bit on Thursday, but a feeling of calm has returned to markets. Like a late summer storm, the market volatility of the last few days has simply faded away, said Societe Generale strategist Kit Juckes. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, is back below 30 after surging above 35 on Tuesday. According to the CNN Business Fear & Greed Index, greed is once again the prevailing emotion driving markets. Kevin Giddis, managing director at Raymond James, said that whether the positive sentiment holds, or gains momentum, is anyones guess. Of course, volatility will return at some point. The question for investors is when  and what will provide the trigger. In Europe, where the number of coronavirus cases is surging and trade talks between the European Union and the United Kingdom are at risk of collapsing, investors are keeping a close watch on the central bank. The European Central Bank will issue its latest decision on Thursday, and President Christine Lagarde will hold a press conference. Investors will be looking for signs the bank could turn the stimulus tap back on following a sharp rise in the euro against the dollar. There is also some positive economic data to consider. Industrial production figures for France and Italy confirmed a continued recovery in July, although output levels remain depressed compared to a year ago In the United States, investors will have new labor market data to consider. Economists predict that another 846,000 Americans filed initial claims for unemployment benefits last week. That would be an improvement from 881,000 claims filed in the previous week, and a sign that the job market is recovering. In recent months, there have only been two weeks when claims came in under 1 million. The big picture: The US economy is operating at 79% of where it was in early March, according to The Back-to-Normal Index from Moodys Analytics and CNN Business. Looking further ahead, the Federal Reserve will next week hold its final meeting before the US election. Economists dont expect major fireworks, but every utterance from the central bank matters in this environment. The markets hope for next weeks Fed meeting is likely going to be about continued guidance. Specifically, how far will the Fed let inflation rise before it moves in to tighten or take the punchbowl away? said Giddis. The far-reaching consequences of climate change have the ability to create chaos in the financial system and disrupt the American economy, according to a new report from the US government. The report, which is the first of its kind from the government, calls for Congress to swiftly impose a price on carbon and urges financial regulators to more urgently and decisively work to understand and blunt the looming economic damage, reports my colleague Matt Egan. Climate change poses a major risk to the stability of the US financial system and to its ability to sustain the American economy, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commissions climate subcommittee wrote. The CFTC climate subcommittee laid out 53 recommendations for dealing with the climate risk, including requiring companies to disclose details on greenhouse gas emissions, piloting climate stress tests, and forcing banks to address climate change financial risks. The report also urged regulators to incorporate climate risks into their mandates, including the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which is charged with identifying emerging threats to financial stability. Financial markets today are not pricing climate risk. The financial markets cannot do that on their own, Bob Litterman, chairman of the CFTC climate subcommittee, said in the report. Until this fundamental flaw is fixed, capital will flow in the wrong direction. Lawmakers and industry leaders have debated a price on carbon, such as a carbon tax, for decades. Even some large fossil fuel companies such as ExxonMobil (XOM) support a carbon tax. Europe has had a carbon trading system for over a decade. Getting into wind: On Thursday, BP said its moving into offshore wind power for the first time with a $1.1 billion investment in the United States. BP (BP) said in a statement on Thursday that it will buy a 50% stake in Equinors Empire Wind and Beacon Wind projects on the east coast. Together, they have the potential to power more than 2 million American homes. The context: BP unveiled a major strategic overhaul last month to deliver on its promise of net zero emissions by 2050. The company plans a 10-fold increase in annual low carbon investments to $5 billion by 2030, when it expects its oil and gas production to have fallen by 40% on 2019 levels. Consumers are swapping out jeans and officewear for yoga pants, sweats and shorts as they work from home and spend more free time there. Thats great news for retailers of athleisure, the casual clothing designed for workouts and everyday wear, reports my colleague Nathaniel Meyersohn A few caveats: Its not clear how long people will continue to pay up for items like expensive leggings, shorts and tanks. And the pandemic is driving up costs at some retailers. Despite closing stores temporarily because of the pandemic, Lululemon said Tuesday that sales increased 2% to $903 million during the quarter ending August 2, compared with the same period last year. Rising costs pushed net income down to $86.8 million, a decline of 31% from a year earlier. We are seeing a shift in behavior in terms of working from home, sweating from home and the increased importance of living an active and healthy lifestyle. These trends play to our strengths, CEO Calvin McDonald said. Other winners: Athleta, the athleisure label at Gap, saw sales increase 6% during its latest quarter, despite Gaps sales falling. PVH, the parent of Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein, said athleisure clothing was one of its strongest sellers during its latest quarter. And Dicks Sporting Goods said consumers were gravitating to athletic attire. Initial unemployment claims will be published at 8:30 a.m. ET.

What the war on terror teaches us about Covid-19,"As we remember the tragedy of 9/11 and honor the thousands who lost their lives, we find ourselves in the midst of another tragedy. More than 191,000 Americans have died from Covid-19, and as many more could die by the end of the year. Though the present situation is different in many ways, the war on terror offers a useful model for the years ahead. Mindful of the many pitfalls of that effort, we should nevertheless learn from its example and gird ourselves for another long-term fight, fortifying our government agencies and bringing the international community together in a concerted campaign against this shared global threat. Jihadist hijackers would seem to have little in common with the microscopic menace we face today. One is the worst kind of human evil, the other a mere packet of genetic material. But terrorists and viruses are both tiny actors that can bring a mighty civilization to its knees. Both threats are decentralized in structure, making it impossible to strike a single decisive blow against them. Spreading unseen across vast networks, they are difficult to detect and even harder to defeat. The 2001 invasion of Afghanistan quickly deprived al Qaeda of its stronghold, but the victory was fleeting. The group reconstituted itself in Pakistan and, like a hydra, sprouted many heads around the world  in Yemen, in Syria, in North Africa, and most notoriously, in Iraq. The Iraqi offshoot would grow into its own independent organization, ISIS, a cancer that President Obama vowed to eradicate. Yet by the time the US and its allies defeated the caliphate under President Trump, the cancer had already metastasized to other countries, such as Afghanistan and the Philippines (not to mention, large remnants of the group survived and continue to operate in Iraq and Syria). The Covid-19 pandemic, too, has been an ongoing game of whack-a-mole. By the time China got the virus under control, it had already spread to Europe. By the time Europe got it under control, it had already spread to the United States. New Yorks outbreak seeded other outbreaks in states across the South and West. Places that had tamed the virus experienced new flare-ups, even in New Zealand, which at one point enjoyed more than 100 days without a single case of community transmission. Everyone seems to think a vaccine will magically solve the crisis. It will certainly help, but consider that humans have eradicated only two diseases throughout history, even when vaccines exist. For one thing, viruses can mutate, which is why a new flu vaccine must be produced each year. An ineffective vaccine that is rushed to market, as may be the case with Russias vaccine, could actually promote mutation, some have warned. Even in the case of a safe and effective vaccine, uptake will be far from universal, with anti-vaxxers providing aid and comfort to the invisible enemy. Billions of people in developing countries may struggle to get access to the vaccine, so even if the US inoculates a critical mass of its population, the pandemic could rage across much of the world, affording more opportunities for mutation. Animals can serve as a reservoir for the virus and potentially reinfect humans with a different strain. In short, as Sarah Zhang writes in The Atlantic, This virus is never going away. That doesnt mean society needs to shut down forever. The flu has become a manageable disease over time (though quite deadly nonetheless). Still, we are in the early days of the coronavirus, and there is a long road ahead. Recall that after the September 11 attacks, President Bush pledged to direct every resource at our command ... to the destruction and to the defeat of the global terror network, cautioning that this would be a lengthy campaign unlike any other we have ever seen. In contrast, President Trump keeps insisting the virus will simply disappear or go away. That attitude does not bode well for Americas future resolve and preparedness, particularly when habitat destruction, climate change, population growth and global travel are creating the conditions for more pandemics to come. Since President Bush launched the war on terror in 2001, the US has suffered few major attacks. That is not because the threat of terrorism disappeared. It is the product of active vigilance by a national security apparatus that was strengthened after 9/11. It is the product of forging partnerships with countries around the world, sharing intelligence and training local forces. Winning the long-term fight against Covid-19, and other pandemics that arise, will similarly require investing in the domestic public health agencies, collaborating with foreign scientists on research, and working with other countries to prevent and manage new outbreaks. Just as international organizations have helped coordinate airport security and cut off terrorist financing, global bodies such as the World Health Organization will play a vital role in battling the virus. There were, of course, grave errors committed during the war on terror. The US distorted intelligence to justify an unrelated errand in Iraq and then, in spite of fierce resistance at the United Nations, chose to invade anyway. It killed innocent civilians in war zones. It subjected terrorist suspects to indefinite detention and torture, and it subjected its own citizens to intrusive surveillance and racial profiling. These moves were generally counterproductive  actually breeding terrorism, destabilizing the Middle East, eroding Americas standing in the world and hurting Americans trust in government. The response spun out of control, like the cytokine storm that kills so many Covid-19 patients. Sadly, something similar may be happening again as the US goes down a path of politicizing the public health agencies, starting trade wars over medical supplies and withdrawing from international organizations. The new bogeyman is not Saddam Hussein, but Chinese President Xi Jinping, and for all of Beijings faults, the US would do well to avoid a new cold war with China, which could turn in to a bigger disaster than the Iraq War. The other major mistake of the war on terror was neglect, of two kinds. One was giving in to war-weariness, thereby breathing new life into adversaries like the Taliban and allowing groups like ISIS to flourish. That kind of negligence has been Americas cardinal sin during the pandemic. The second kind of neglect was a failure to tackle other problems, as the counterterrorism offensive went off in unnecessary directions and swallowed up attention and resources that could have been channeled toward education, infrastructure, climate change, cybersecurity, and yes, pandemic preparedness. With that cautionary tale in mind, we must ensure the War on Covid does not distract America from its other urgent challenges. In truth, many of these issues are interrelated. A society with better schools, more affordable health care and a cleaner environment wont be such easy prey for a virus. Above all, the task must be to heal our national divisions. What was clear 19 years ago and what is clear today is that unity is the strongest weapon in Americas arsenal.",10/09/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/10/opinions/9-11-war-on-terror-covid-19/index.html
Why Europe still can? take risks with its supply of Russian gas,"The future of a nearly complete gas pipeline that promises to strengthen Russias grip on Europes energy supply has been thrown into doubt following the poisoning of opposition leader Alexey Navalny. The German government has not ruled out consequences for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline as it moves to press the Kremlin for information about the poisoning, but analysts say that such a move would face multiple legal challenges and threaten Europes cheapest supply of gas. Navalny is being treated in a Berlin hospital after being flown there from the Siberian city of Omsk. Russia was the European Unions largest supplier of natural gas last year, accounting for 38% of imports, according to the European Commission. Restricting supply would raise prices for consumers across the European Union, experts say. The European Union has been here before. The bloc pledged to cut its dependence on Russian gas after Moscow annexed part of Ukraine in 2014, but imports increased between 2016 and 2018 before falling slightly last year. Germany still imports more than half its natural gas from Russia, which is also the leading supplier of crude oil and coal to the European Union. Russia has the largest natural gas reserves in the world and is the worlds biggest gas exporter. The primary purpose of Nord Stream 2, which connects Russia to Germany via the Baltic Sea, is to reduce the reliance on transit routes through Ukraine, which have been increasingly difficult to negotiate due to the armed conflict in that country. The new Baltic pipeline will have the capacity to meet about one third of the European Unions future gas import requirements, according to the Nord Stream 2 website. Russian state-controlled gas giant Gazprom is the projects sole shareholder. While Europe has several other sources of gas supply, including liquified natural gas (LNG) from the United States, Russia is a very big one and a very competitive one, which is why people buy it, said James Henderson, director of the natural gas research program at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. Europe could decide to stop buying gas from Russia altogether, as Poland and Lithuania are trying to do, but prices would increase, Henderson added. Nord Stream 2 coming online next year as planned could reduce the cost of gas in Europe by about 25%, compared to a scenario where the project is abandoned, according to a Wood Mackenzie estimate. That would be good news for European gas consumers, obviously, but less welcome for companies seeking to export LNG from the US, said Wood Mackenzies Americas vice chair, Ed Crooks. The United States has already imposed sanctions on entities involved with Nord Stream 2, which it says is detrimental to the European Unions energy security. It is concerned that the pipeline will bolster Russias dominance in the European gas market, giving it undue influence in the region and squeezing out American LNG exporters. Ukraine is also a key US ally and collects gas transit fees from Russia, leading to worries that the pipeline could destabilize the country and undermine the development of the gas market in Central and Eastern Europe. A bipartisan bill introduced in the US Congress in June aims to expand sanctions on companies involved in the project, which is about 90% complete. Germany, which has historically argued against the US position, could threaten sanctions on companies involved in Nord Stream 2 as a bargaining chip in the Navalny investigation, Henderson said, but doing so would have negative consequences for many European businesses. Among them are two major German firms, the utility company Uniper and energy group Wintershall DEA, which have financed the pipeline. Other lenders include French utilities company Engie, Austrian industrial firm OMV (OMVJF) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA). According to the German Eastern Business Association, European companies have already invested 5 billion ($5.9 billion) in the project and substantial damages claims could arise if there were any attempts to prevent it from being completed. Commercial interests may prove to be stronger than political interests on this particular front, said Carole Nakhle, CEO of London energy consultancy Crystol Energy. It would also be politically difficult to sanction the pipeline, given that its backers have invested alongside Gazprom in an earlier pipeline project, Nord Stream, which is chaired by Germanys former chancellor Gerhard Schroder. Russia would be hurt if Europe targets its energy trade. The European Union is its most important market and Gazprom has acted to retain market share by offering price discounts and more flexible contracts to many of its customers, Nakhle added. Gazproms pipeline expansion plans, particularly Nord Stream 2, hinge upon such assumption of competitiveness as well as a strategic desire for more direct access to European core markets, she said. However, other new pipelines into Europe, as well as the flexibility and competitive variable costs of LNG are likely to restrict the medium-term role of Russian gas. Given the European Unions diversity of gas supply, energy security concerns are overblown. But it would be a dramatic move to cancel the project, she said.

"At least 15 people have been killed in California, Oregon and Washington wildfires","[Breaking news update at 11:00 p.m. ET] Authorities found seven bodies in Northern California on Thursday as firefighters battled multiple ravaging wildfires, raising the total number of victims in the state to 10. At least five others have been killed in Washington state and Oregon this week amid a series of out of control wildfires. [Previous story, published at 9:40 p.m. ET] The deadly, fast-moving wildfires ravaging across multiple West Coast states on Thursday have forced about 500,000 people in Oregon to flee their homes, state officials said. The Oregon Office of Emergency Management estimates that about half a million people  more than 10% of the states population, according to the Census Bureau  have been evacuated and that number continues to grow. The wildfires have left at least eight people dead in California, Washington state and Oregon this week, and were raging out of control Thursday despite firefighters efforts. Thick smoke has blanketed the region, and some communities in southern Oregon have already been reduced to ashes. Firefighters from around the United States were called to help contain the massive blazes. As of Thursday, more than 100 wildfires across 12 Western states burned more than 4.3 million acres, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Thats nearly 7,000 square miles, or roughly the size of New Jersey. One of the blazes, the August Complex fire in Northern California, is now considered the biggest in the states recorded history, according to Cal Fire. It has consumed 471,185 acres and has only been 24% contained since it was sparked by storm lightning on August 17. While the full extent of the damage remains unclear in many communities, the wildfires have taken a toll on human lives. A child in Washington state was killed in the Cold Springs Fire, officials said Wednesday. Two of the childs relatives were airlifted to Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, where theyre both in critical condition and being treated by burn specialists, according to a hospital spokeswoman. Live updates on the wildfires In Oregon, three people were killed in Marion County and one in Jackson County. We also fear that this is not going to be the only folks well find deceased up there, Marion County Sheriff Joe Kast said. In California, officials said they are working to recover the remains of three people who died in Butte County, about 80 miles north of Sacramento, in the North Complex Fire. It was terrifying, resident Nancy Hamilton told CNN of the fires that tore through the Berry Creek area. It was a beast. The thing is a beast. Hamilton, a filmmaker, drove through the area Wednesday to get a closer look at the destruction. She says she is currently housing several families who were forced to evacuate their homes, including her best friends 80-year-old grandmother, whose home was swallowed by the flames. Theyre pretty devastated, Hamilton said. She just lost everything. I was able to take photos for her so at least she knows that it was gone, she said. A lot of people dont know their houses are gone and theyre wondering. More than 14,000 firefighters are battling 28 fires across the Golden State, according to the California Department of Fires and Forestry Protection. The North Complex fire has consumed more than 250,000 acres and was 24% contained as of Thursday morning. In the central California mountains, the Creek Fire has destroyed more than 360 structures, fire officials said. Its now grown to more than 166,000 acres and remains 0% contained. About 30,000 people were evacuated due to the fire, which is burning northeast of Fresno. But returning residents to their homes will likely be a lengthy process, Fresno County Sheriffs Deputy Lieutenant Brandon Pursell said Wednesday. Its going to be probably a couple weeks, just be patient with us, Pursell said. Toby Wait and his family fled the fires over the weekend. I went on my deck and looked out, and there was just orange flowing throughout the hills, Wait, a resident of Big Creek, told CNN. Their home is one of dozens that have been lost to the Creek Fire. Now the family is sheltering with Waits parents in Hanford and other family members in Fresno. Weve taken refuge here. Were nomads right now, he said. Weve got our duffle bags and when we wear out our welcome, we move on to the next house. Fire officials issued evacuation orders and warnings across several parts of the state including in Southern California, where the El Dorado Fire continues to burn parts of San Bernardino County and is 31% contained. In San Diego County, the Valley Fire  which has burned more than 17,000 acres  also prompted several evacuation orders and warnings. On Wednesday, all 18 national forests in the state were ordered closed due to the explosive growth of wildfires, a notice from forest service officials said. Those temporary closures encompass more than 20 million acres of land. The number of large fires and extreme fire behavior we are seeing across the state is historic, said Regional Forester Randy Moore. I ask all Californians and visitors to take these closures and evacuations seriously for their own safety. Statewide, more than 3.1 million acres have been scorched this year alone  26 times the amount that burned in the state through this date last year, according to Cal Fire. This time last year, California saw 4,927 fires that burned 118,000 acres, according to the governor. In 2020, there have been 7,606 blazes so far. Wildfires are a big part of the seasonal challenge, Newsom said. The challenge were facing now is the extreme fire events that we believe are climate induced. Kevin McKay moved to Chico after losing his home in Paradise to the Camp Fire in 2018, the most destructive wildfire in state history. The smoke has been bad for a couple weeks, he told CNN. Then on Wednesday morning, he awoke to skies blackened by smoke and ash from the North Complex Fire coating everything, he said. Its unnerving, to say the least, he said. McKay said he doesnt feel like hes in direct danger this time around, but friends and family who have been impacted by the recent fires have asked for his help and advice. Since 2018, its been a march to kind of put life back together, he told CNN Thursday. Weve had Covid now, and theres social discourse and unrest all over the nation. And then the fire comes back and just theres a bunch of anxiety I didnt realize was there. Theres just this kind of relentless punishment that kind of keeps coming, he said. To rationalize it, all I can say is Mother Earth is definitely fighting back here. Authorities declared a state of emergency in Portland on Thursday evening, closing city parks and activating evacuation sites for people displaced by the threat of fires. The emergency order, signed by Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler, says the city has  limited firefighting resources available and many resources are currently deployed to assist with firefighting efforts in other parts of the state. Numerous wildfires in Oregon continued burning without containment on Thursday after nearly wiping out the southern cities of Phoenix and Talent. Thirty-seven wildfires remain active  down from nearly 50 earlier this week  as 900,000 acres have been consumed across the state, the Oregons office of emergency management said. We have never seen this amount of uncontained fire across our state, Gov. Kate Brown said in a news conference Thursday. She said that about 30,000 to 40,000 people have been forced to evacuate their homes. The scope of the wildfires is unprecedented. For the past ten years, the governor said, the state has seen an average of 500,000 acres burned each year. Among those impacted by the fire is Denise Moyle, who told CNN affiliate KATU that her familys home in Lyons was destroyed by the Santiam Fire, originally called the Beachie Creek Fire, in Linn County, approximately 70 miles south of Portland. Moyles family escaped early Monday after a phone call from a concerned neighbor. We left not thinking we werent going to have a home, so we left without much, Moyle told the news station. The family found the smoldering remains of their home when they returned Wednesday morning. After sifting through what was left, they were able to recover just a few small items, Moyle said. I dont know where my family is going to go, Moyle told KATU. Fire officials initially thought the fire would likely grow to less than 500 acres, but a historic windstorm Monday fanned the flames and the blaze grew to more than 131,000 acres in a night. The fire has now burned more than 158,000 acres and is 0% contained. According to the US Forest Service, the fire has been fueled by high winds and dry conditions. Its been fed by a series of small fires largely caused by downed power lines and other ignition sources throughout the area, the US Forest Service said. Wildfires have erupted in Washington in the past days, claiming the life of a child and leaving parts of the state experiencing unhealthy air quality conditions. Gov. Jay Inslee described the blazes as cataclysmic while touring the massive damage in the town of Rosalina on Thursday. This is a place where the whole heart of a town was torn out, Inslee told reporters. Washington state resident Darrell Herde woke up to a stranger pounding on his door this week. He barely escaped. The enormity of these fires, the geographical scope, the intensity and the destruction are unequal in Washington state history, Gov. Jay Inslee said. The Sumner Grade Fire, just outside Tacoma, Washington, burned several homes and prompted hundreds of evacuations, CNN affiliate KOMO reported. On Wednesday, it was about 20% contained, the news station reported. In Western Washington, the old rule of thumb used to be if it was 20% you got out of the way because you were expecting erratic fire behavior, East Pierce Fire Chief Bud Backer said, according to the station. But with homes in the way, we didnt have that luxury. Backer says he was there when the fire exploded Monday, the affiliate said. When it hit, it was like a blow torch. People have started returning to their homes in Graham, Washington, where several homes were destroyed in a brush fire caused by a tree falling on a powerline, CNN affiliate KIRO reported. One resident, Darrell Herde, said he barely escaped his home after he woke up Monday night to a stranger pounding on his door. He was yanking on my door and telling me to run. I thought he was a little nuts. I didnt think it was that bad, Herde said. Five minutes after, I walked out the door. It was crawling through trees, the 71-year-old said. And you cant believe how fast those embers were flying at you. He found his home a pile of rubble. Now he just has to clothes on his back. Someplace in that pile, there is my mothers rings, and it tore my heart out, he said. Thats something that sort of killed me this morning. The rest of this stuff  its stuff that you can replace.",10/09/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/10/us/us-west-wildfires-thursday/
Hamburgers are hard on the planet. These cattle ranchers are trying to change that,"Scientists have pointed to beef as one major culprit in climate change. But that doesnt mean all burgers are created equal. Greenhouse gas emissions from livestock represent 14.5% of all emissions produced by human activity, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Livestock farming has such a large impact because cows, through burps, farts and manure, emit methane, a potent heat-trapping gas. Raising cows for food also uses a tremendous amount of land and water, some of which could be used to produce food more efficiently. Scientists last year implored governments to set reduction targets for livestock farms in order to help fight climate change in a letter to the Lancet Planetary Health Journal. Clearing land for livestock farming also contributes to global warming. Still, there are ways to produce beef that are a lot better than others, said Tim Searchinger, research scholar at Princeton University and a senior fellow at the World Resources Institute, a nonprofit group that works on climate change solutions. So long as we are going to eat beef, we want to produce it well. Certain grazing practices can help improve the local ecology and capture carbon from the atmosphere, while adding ingredients like lemongrass or seaweed to cattle diets could potentially help reduce methane, he said. Some farmers have adopted these grazing practices, and say the methods are making a huge difference. In the United States, most beef does not come from pasture-raised cows that munch on grass. More often, it comes from factory farms, or massive facilities that raise animals for food. But cattle raised on grasslands and grazed in specific ways can help improve local ecosystems. Rotational grazing, or moving cattle around to give grassland time to recover between feedings, can lead to more native wildlife, better water quality and produce more beef, Searchinger said. Producing more beef per acre helps save land. Loren Poncia and his wife Lisa own Stemple Creek Ranch, a family farm in Tomales, California. His family has changed their farming practices to make their land healthier. By grazing with more of a plan and having higher impact for a shorter amount of time, we actually grow more forage and we sequester more carbon in the soil, said Poncia. Grazing practices that are better for the land help maintain the health of the grass the cows eat, as well as the soil, keeping heat-trapping carbon stored in the ground instead of releasing it into the air. Sequestering carbon helps fight climate change by removing harmful carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, in addition to improving soil health. Theres a very nice relationship in healthy landscapes between green and growing plants, like grass, and carbon storage underground, said Courtney White, co-founder of The Quivira Coalition, a non-profit group devoted to improving ecological health. For Will Harris, a fourth-generation cattle rancher in Bluffton, Georgia, that type of grazing is a way to emulate the farming practices of his ancestors, which were less taxing on the land and animals. After college at the University of Georgias School of Agriculture, Harris joined his father on their farm, White Oak Pastures. At the time, White Oak used industrial farming tactics. But Harris eventually realized that those methods were sapping the land. In the mid 90s I started changing my farming practices to a system that really would resemble what my great-grandfather and grandfather did on this farm more than it did what my father and I had done on the farm, he said. Now, he said, we graze the land the way that the buffalo would have, with a maximum animal impact on the land and then a very long recovery time before we get back to that piece of land. That requires moving his animals to new parts of the pasture daily. Grazing patterns can help improve land and trap carbon in soil, but it doesnt cut back on methane, the greenhouse gases emitted by cows. To reduce methane, some farmers might consider using feed additives in cow diets  a still-experimental practice that caught Burger Kings attention. Recently, the burger chain announced that it will start using lemongrass-fed beef in its Whopper burgers in some locations. Adding lemongrass to bovine diets can help reduce their methane emissions by about 33% per day, Burger King said. The chain worked on the project with professors from the Autonomous University at the State of Mexico and University of California, Davis. Others are exploring the use of seaweed and other ingredients. Strategic grazing operations and these types of additives can both play a role in helping improve cattles impact on the environment, Searchinger noted. Another crucial component involves changing consumer practices: Eating less meat. Reducing meat intake is one of the most impactful ways for individuals to reduce their contribution to global warming. Moderating our beef consumption is really important, Searchinger said. Im in favor of all of the above.",10/09/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/10/business/meat-climate-change/index.html
BP invests in offshore wind to power 2 million American homes,"BP is moving into offshore wind power for the first time with a $1.1 billion investment in the United States, as the company pushes into clean energy following a century of oil exploration. BP (BP) said in a statement on Thursday that it will buy a 50% stake in Equinors Empire Wind and Beacon Wind projects on the east coast of the United States. Together, they have the potential to power more than 2 million American homes. This is an important early step in the delivery of our new strategy and pivot to truly becoming an integrated energy company, BP CEO Bernard Looney said. Offshore wind is growing at around 20% a year globally and recognized as being a core part of the worlds need to limit emissions. BP unveiled a major strategic overhaul last month to deliver on its promise of net zero emissions by 2050. The company plans a 10-fold increase in annual low carbon investments to $5 billion by 2030, when it expects its oil and gas production to have fallen by 40% on 2019 levels. The deal with Norways Equinor is expected to close early next year and could pave the way for further investment into the fast-growing US offshore wind market. BP already has a significant onshore wind business in the United States, where it employs about 14,000 people and more than 40% of its shares are held. Equinor said the companies will consider future opportunities in the country. Our partnership underlines both companies strong commitment to accelerate the energy transition and combining our strengths will enable us to grow a profitable offshore wind business together in the US, CEO Eldar Stre said in a statement. The Empire Wind and Beacon Wind developments are located off New York City and the Massachusetts coast respectively. Equinor commissioned the worlds first floating offshore wind farm in 2017 off the coast of Scotland and is building offshore wind clusters in the North Sea, the US east coast and the Baltic Sea. Together with Danish multinational Orsted, it is spearheading the Ocean Renewable Energy Action Coalition, which launched in January and seeks to advance sustainable deployment of ocean-based renewable energy. BP said last month that its plan to pivot away from oil will involve major investments into bioenergy, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage. At the same time, BP will reduce its oil and gas refining portfolio and aims to raise $25 billion by selling assets over the next five years. The company was handed the largest environmental fine in US history following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, and in 2015 it agreed to a $20.8 billion settlement with the Department of Justice to settle claims. BP said in 2019 that the disaster had cost the company $67 billion in fines, clean up costs and litigation.",10/09/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/10/business/bp-offshore-wind-equinor/index.html
"Climate crisis could displace 1.2 billion people by 2050, report warns","The global climate crisis could see more than a billion people displaced from their homes in the next 30 years, as ecological disasters drive mass migrations and greater armed conflict, according to a new report released Wednesday. The Ecological Threat Register, conducted by the Sydney-based Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), projected that as many as 1.2 billion people around the world could be displaced by 2050. No country will be able to escape the impact of the climate crisis  but the worlds poorest and most vulnerable populations will be hardest hit. Ecological threats and climate change pose serious challenges to global development and peacefulness, the report said. The worlds least resilient countries, when faced with ecological breakdowns, are more likely to experience civil unrest, political instability, social fragmentation and economic collapse. The report drew on data from international organizations like the United Nations, the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, the Food and Agriculture Organization, and the IEPs prior research on countries resilience levels. Using these figures, the IEP then calculated the relative threats of population growth, water stress, food insecurity, droughts, floods, cyclones, and rising temperature and sea levels. It found that more than a billion people lived in 31 countries that had low resilience  meaning they arent equipped to withstand the impact of ecological change in the coming decades. The regions facing the highest number of threats are Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, the report said. Not all of these people will be displaced, however it is likely that a large number of them will be, said the IEP. Better-resourced countries in places like North America and Europe will be more able to manage the effects of these disasters  but theyll likely face huge flows of climate refugees, the report warned. This will have huge social and political impacts, not just in the developing world, but also in the developed, as mass displacement will lead to larger refugee flows to the most developed countries, said IEP founder Steve Killelea in a news release, adding that ecological change was the next big global threat to our planet. The global population currently stands at 7.8 billion. That number is expected to reach 10 billion by 2050  straining the worlds already stretched natural resources, the report said, citing data from the UNs Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Most of this population growth is expected to take place in countries with ongoing armed conflict, like those in Sub-Saharan Africa, the report said. Citing research from the global non-profit organization World Resource Institute, the report projected that by 2050, global demand for food will increase by 50% and 3.5 billion people could suffer from food insecurity. Water scarcity may be an even bigger issue  already, there are more than 2.6 billion people facing high or extreme water stress, meaning they either dont have enough water for their needs or that their water supply is at risk of disruption, the report said. Climate change has caused disrupted rainfall, rising temperatures, and other ecological impacts that are already creating water crises  in 2019, Chennai, Indias sixth biggest city, nearly ran out of water. Water had to be trucked in daily from other states, with people standing in line for hours in the sun to fill up jugs with their daily water ration. By 2040, a total of 5.4 billion people  or more than half of the worlds projected population  will live in countries facing high or extreme water stress. India and China, the worlds top two most populous countries, will be among those countries, the report said. It could also spell even greater violence and conflict, which not only destabilizes economies and governments but drives mass migration. In the past decade alone, water-related violent incidents have increased by 270% worldwide, the IEP said, citing water solutions company WorldWater. Recent years have seen dramatic increases in natural disasters around the world, which experts have long warned are the symptoms of a worsening climate crisis  raging wildfires in California, heat waves across Europe, fears of a dam collapse in China and a record-breaking hurricane in the southern United States. Asia-Pacific has been the most affected region; 29% of all natural disasters in the past 30 years have taken place there, the study found. Europe had the second highest numbers of natural disasters globally. In 2019, India faced the largest population displacement due to natural disasters, with 5 million people having to leave their homes, the study said. Globally, natural disasters displaced 25 million people last year  and the number will likely keep rising, the research team found. And these natural disasters strike hardest in poorer countries; they kill seven times more people in the least developed nations than in highly developed ones, the report found, using socioeconomic indicators from the IEPs previous research on ecological resilience. Its not because the disasters in poorer countries happen more frequently or with greater severity  but because those nations are less able to handle the shock. All these threats combined will create a migration crisis that can then cause spinoff effects like heightened political instability, global insecurity and greater hostility toward immigrants. International cooperation and foreign climate-related aid will be essential in mitigating these effects and helping developing countries build better resilience, the report said. This type of international aid has already increased 34 fold from 2000 to 2018 as the full extent of the crisis became clear  but they still fall well short of what is needed to address these issues going forward, the report warned.",10/09/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/10/world/climate-global-displacement-report-intl-hnk-scli-scn/index.html
"As Chiefs and Texans clash, the NFL embarks on a changed path","In a usual NFL offseason, the news of Patrick Mahomes signing the wealthiest contract in sports history would be one of the biggest  maybe the biggest  stories of the summer for the league . But as the $450 million man led the Kansas City Chiefs against the Houston Texans on Thursday night in the NFL season opener, a most unusual offseason came to an end and a much different path began in earnest for the countrys most popular sports league. And the news is as focused on the events happening around the players as it is with them. The visiting Texans and the Chiefs, the defending Super Bowl champion, played in front of a limited crowd, with some key players missing, and with messages in the Arrowhead Stadium end zones calling for social change. The Chiefs won 34-20. The last time the NFL played, the world was still fairly normal. It was February 2 and the novel coronavirus was to the American public still mostly a mysterious disease overseas. There were nine confirmed cases in the United States. When the US declared a public health emergency two days before the Super Bowl, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement, While this virus poses a serious public health threat, the risk to the American public remains low at this time, and we are working to keep this risk low. Now, with more than 6.3 million cases and more than 191,000 deaths in the United States, the NFL became the latest sports league to cautiously return to competition arenas. And its not just coronavirus that has changed the football landscape. The league has taken a titanic shift on racial and social justice issues in light of the killings of Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other people of color. It sees its position as an influencer for social change. For instance, the Arrowhead Stadium end zones had End Racism and It Takes All of Us inscribed on the boundary markers near the goal posts. Its quite a different tack than in 2016, when Commissioner Roger Goodell and the NFL didnt support then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernicks kneeling protests against police brutality and racism. One player  Kansas City linebacker Alex Okafor  knelt Thursday and raised a fist during the National Anthem. Two players put their hands on Okafors shoulders. Many Chiefs linked arms with teammates. Others put their right hands over their hearts. Houston players went to the locker room area. While the NFL two seasons ago said players must stand or stay in the locker room, Goodell said last month he wont discipline players for kneeling. The NFL stands with the Black community, the players, clubs and fans. Confronting systemic racism with tangible and productive steps is absolutely essential, Goodell said last week in announcing league initiatives that include the end zone messages. We will not relent in our work and we will redouble our efforts to be catalysts for the urgent and sustainable change that our society and communities so desperately need. Players can wear helmet decals with the names of people killed or wounded in encounters with police and others. The song referred to as the Black national anthem  Lift Every Voice and Sing  will play before every game this season. The Texans also remained in the locker room when the song was played Thursday. There are more than 60 NFL players, including three from the Chiefs and one from the Texans, who have opted to miss every game of the season. That includes Dr. Laurent Duvernay-Tardif, a Chiefs offensive lineman who has recently worked as an orderly in a long-term care facility in Canada and is studying online at Harvards school of public health. I miss the guys. I miss the contact. But I also know I made, for me, the right decision, he told Sports Illustrated. In developing Covid-19 protocols with the players union, the NFL made the decision to let teams train in their home cities and play in their own stadiums, a different approach than the NBA bubble and the NHLs hub sites in Edmonton and Toronto. The NFL tests players every day, according to media reports, citing a league memo. In the latest results, one player and seven team personnel tested positive for the virus between August 30 and September 5, a total of 44,510 tests. Between August 12 and 29, four players tested positive. The league went without its normal four preseason games, so this will be the first intensive action for players in the past seven or eight months. It also saw training camps where teams had fewer personnel, some meetings went online, players dined solo, and team members used training rooms with tables spread 6 feet apart. Game day will be different too. Some teams, such as the Chiefs, will allow fans, but most have said they will play at least two home games in empty stadiums. Arrowhead holds 76,000, but only 22% of the seats, about 17,000, were filled Thursday. Even tailgating will have a coronavirus wrinkle, with vehicles using every other spot and pregame festivities in the parking lot limited to pods. The rest of the NFL plays on Sunday  the Eagles play the Washington Football Team and Tom Brady and the Bucs visit the Saints  and Monday.",10/09/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/10/us/nfl-season-opener-spt/index.html
The fires raging out West are unprecedented. They?e also a mere preview of what climate change has in store,"Entire towns have been burned to the ground. Thousands have been forced to flee their homes. And apocalyptic scenes played out in San Francisco, as the city was blanketed in smoke so thick it blocked out the sun. The scale of the fires burning in the Western US right now are unprecedented. More than 3 million acres have burned in California alone, with three of the five largest fires in state history still burning all at once, along with huge swaths of Oregon and Washington. Still, much of the West is only now entering what is typically the most active part of the regions fire season. To scientists, the fingerprints of global warming on these wildfires  and so many other disasters, from the fires that scorched Australia to the hurricanes that have slammed the US  are clear. And as devastating as they have been, far worse disasters could be on the horizon. How bad it gets depends on what we as humans do to reduce heat-trapping gas emissions, said Michael Mann, the director of Penn State Universitys Earth System Science Center. By some measure, its clear that dangerous climate change has already arrived, Mann said in response to emailed questions from CNN. Its a matter of how bad were willing to let it get. Though the scale of destruction is hard to fathom, climate scientists say we should not be surprised. Its shocking to see the impacts, but not scientifically surprising, Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA and the National Center for Atmospheric Research told CNN on Tuesday. This is in line with essentially every prediction for what could happen this year and the trends were seeing over years and decades. Scientists have warned for years that fire seasons like this could come to pass, and that the more we humans heat up the planet, the more we are increasing the odds in favor of the hot, dry conditions conducive to fires. So far, the planet has warmed by a global average of roughly 1.2 degrees Celsius since the 1880s, with human activity responsible for the bulk of that increase. This warming is clear in long-term temperature graphs for the state of California, such as this one below from the nonprofit environmental monitoring organization Berkeley Earth, which shows that August temperatures in the state have climbed steadily over the last 150 years. This past August was the warmest on record for the state of California, according to NOAA, and each of the past six years were at least 1 to 2 degrees Celsius (1.8 to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the historical average. That couple of degrees of [average] warming over decades ... you dont notice it as much, but its still there lurking in the background, sucking extra moisture out of the vegetation and the soil, Swain said. According to the National Climate Assessment, a major state-of-science review of climate change and its projected impacts on the US, additional warming of about 1.4 degrees Celsius (2.5 degrees Fahrenheit) can be expected over the next few decades regardless of future emissions. By the second half of the century, the uncertainty range for the amount of warming grows tremendously, as so much will depend on potential cut backs in carbon emissions in the near future. Lockdowns and shelter-in-place orders during the Covid-19 pandemic did result in the largest drop in greenhouse gas emissions in recorded human history. But scientists expect the reductions will be temporary, and the policies that brought emissions down  i.e. forcing people to stay home  are not sustainable. And despite the brief dip in heat-trapping gas emissions, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are still the highest theyve been in at least 800,000 years. Scientists say the impacts of climate change are growing worse before our very eyes. If youre in California, or on the Gulf Coast, or in Puerto Rico, Texas, the Carolinas, or Iowa, youve seen the devastating consequences of climate change already, Mann said. Still, he says there is time left to flatten the curve of global warming impacts, but the longer we wait, the steeper that curve gets. So much depends on what we choose to do, Mann said. If we keep planetary warming below 1.5 Celsius, which is still possible given concerted climate action, we can keep climate change impacts within our adaptive capacity. If we dont, we will likely exceed it.",11/09/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/11/weather/western-wildfires-climate-change-future/index.html
"In California? smoke-filled horizon, it? become hard to breathe","For West Coast residents, the anxiety that comes with fire season is all too familiar. Its common to have an emergency bag  filled with items like a first-aid kit, a flashlight, a portable cellphone battery pack and a map marked with at least two evacuation routes  at the ready. And along with the emergency bag, a plan at the ready for places to stay if you need to evacuate. But this year, with air so thick with smoke its hard to breathe, the fires, which span beyond California into Oregon and Washington, seem worse. And according to experts, thats because they are. The unprecedented wildfires that continue to cause havoc on the West Coast have claimed the lives of at least eight people. Quite literally, the West Coast is burning  from the orange skies in San Francisco to the ash rain in Southern California, the Golden State looks like it has been given the Hollywood dystopia treatment. But its not a dystopia  its a reality: The climate crisis has arrived  and on the West Coast, people are getting a front-row view of just how bad it is via the air they breathe. Los Angeles experienced its worst air quality in more than 25 years amid a historic heat wave last weekend, data from the South Coast Air Quality Management District shows. The ozone pollution reading from Downtown Los Angeles was so high Sunday, air quality officials said, it was not initially reported. Instead, officials conducted an additional manual review to make sure it was correct. Climate change has not just made the extreme heat waves that coincided with the fires worse, Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA and the National Center for Atmospheric Research, told CNN earlier this week. The bigger effect is the more subtle, long-term warming. That couple of degrees of (average) warming over decades ... you dont notice it as much, but its still there lurking in the background, sucking extra moisture out of the vegetation and the soil. Satellite images from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reveal that the wildfire smoke continued to blanket most of the West Coast on Thursday morning. Because of this, the air quality remains moderate to even hazardous across this region, including in all major cities. But West Coast residents dont need NOAA to tell them: They just need to step outside and breathe  or attempt to. As a recent Time magazine journalist noted, during fire season in California breathing feels like a luxury for more and more months of the year. As of Thursday, the South Coast Air Quality Management District said a smoke advisory remained in effect for most of Los Angeles County and parts of Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties. Fortunately, many people in the fire areas are already equipped with masks (unfortunately, thats due to their concerns over catching or spreading Covid). Dr. John Balmes, a pulmonologist at University of California San Francisco, told CNN that an N95 or an N100 respirator, certified by NIOSH, is the best respiratory protection from both Covid-19 and PM2.5, the tiny lung-damaging pollution particles that are found in the worst concentrations of wildfire smoke. Cloth masks, he said, prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2  but offer little protection from wildfire smoke. Balmes recommends that people stay indoors with the windows closed and put central ventilation on recirculate mode, or create a clean air room with a portable HEPA air filter device. The California Air Resources Board echoed similar tips, adding that people should listen and watch for air quality reports and warnings. Smoke can hurt eyes, irritate lungs and worsen chronic heart and lung disease, the agency said in a tweet. Fires have destroyed over 3,900 structures in California, as of Thursday, and at least 14,000 firefighters are battling 29 major fires up and down the state. Authorities in many communities have had to order mandatory evacuations, and more than 170,000 customers recently went without power to prevent future blazes. And with all the fires comes the bad air quality. Hurts to breathe, extremely light headed, another Twitter user wrote. Feeling so sick. Anybody elses eyes been burning from all this smoke and bad air quality or is it just me?? wrote another. Some, like Juliana Park, narrowly escaped one of the many fires while on a getaway over Labor Day Weekend. The 24-year-old, who lives in Mountain View, had gone on a five-hour road trip from the Bay Area toward Sierra National Forest for a backpacking trip last Saturday. Her group had hiked for about an hour when they heard lightning. That was our cue to turn around, she told CNN. We didnt have cell service either, so we thought it would be safest to go back as soon as possible. As they walked back to the car, Park said they started to see the sky was a different color. It was orange, but also very gray, she said. I was wearing a white shirt and you could see the black ash on my shirt, and the white ash falling on top of our eyelashes. When we got to the car, we had a red Honda, you could see on the hood black and white ash. It was getting harder to breath and see. They made it home safely, but passed a smaller fire on their way, which Park posted a video of on Twitter. Later in the week, Park woke up to orange Bay Area skies. The smoke and ash are acting like natures version of an Instagram filter, CNN meteorologist Judson Jones said this week. The particles in the air are refracting sunlight similar to the way small air particles do when the sun sets or rises. Massive plumes of smoke generated by the wildfires raging across the state has led to the longest stretch of unhealthy air quality alerts on record in the San Francisco Bay Area, with 25 straight days of Spare The Air alerts, Bay Area Air Quality Management District spokeswoman Erin DeMerritt told CNN. The previous record was 14 consecutive days during the 2018 Camp Fire that devastated the city of Paradise. Park and her roommate kept all their apartment windows closed. If you have paid attention to the headlines  and the global climate change activists  it shouldnt come as a surprise that the fires have worsened. Even earlier this year  in pre-pandemic times  Australia saw its own devastating wildfires that burned across the country last year and into 2020. A new analysis published in March showed that the fires were made far more likely and intense by the climate crisis. Scientists found that the chances of the kind of extreme weather that triggered the blazes have increased by more than 30% since 1900, and that fire conditions like this are at least four times more likely than they were at the start of the 20th century. Still, its hard to understand the impact when its not necessarily close to home. I would say growing up in Orange County, I didnt really pay attention to the fires, Park said. But I think we can all say no matter how long youve lived in California, that the fires have gotten considerably worse. Over 3.1 million acres, twice the size of Delaware, have burned in California as a result of the wildfires ravaging the state, according to a Cal Fire press release issued Thursday. This years fire season has been a record-breaking year, in not only the total amount of acres burned, but 6 of the top 20 largest wildfires in California history have occurred in 2020, said Cal Fire. Gov. Gavin Newsom has pointed to climate change as a primary factor. This time last year, California saw 4,927 fires that burned 118,000 acres, according to the governor. In 2020, there have been 7,606 blazes so far. In Oregon, Gov. Kate Brown said more than 300,000 acres have burned and for the parts that arent yet on fire, the worst fire conditions in three decades persist. And in Washington, more acres were burned on Monday than were charred in the past 12 fire seasons, Gov. Jay Inslee said. Bottom line? We have been more and more bad air quality days due to increased wildfires driven by climate change, said Balmes, the pulmonologist. And so, West Coasters must be even more careful. The people at greatest risk of adverse health effects from wildfire smoke are those with pre-existing hear and lung disease, Balmes said. That said, even healthy people may be at increased for respiratory infections, including COVID-19.

"Rio Tinto CEO resigns after destruction of 46,000-year-old sacred Indigenous site","Rio Tinto (RIO) CEO Jean-Sebastien Jacques has resigned under pressure from investors over the companys destruction of a 46,000-year-old sacred Indigenous site in Australia to expand an iron ore mine. Jacques will leave once his successor is chosen or at the end of next March, whichever date comes first, according to the company. Two other executives are also departing: Chris Salisbury, head of the iron ore business, and Simone Niven, group executive for corporate relations. Salisbury is stepping down from his position immediately and will leave the company at the end of the year. Niven will also exit at the end of December. Rio Tintos stock was down nearly 1% in Sydney on Friday. What happened at Juukan was wrong, Rio Tinto chairman Simon Thompson said in a statement, referring to the destruction of two rock shelters in Western Australia that contained artifacts indicating tens of thousands of years of continuous human occupation. We are determined to ensure that the destruction of a heritage site of such exceptional archaeological and cultural significance never occurs again at a Rio Tinto operation, Thompson added. The three executives will still receive some pay as part of the terms of their contracts, including long-term incentive rewards. They have already been penalized a combined 3.8 million (roughly $5 million) in cut bonuses. The destruction of the Juukan Gorge caves went ahead on May 24 despite a seven-year battle by the local custodians of the land, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people, to protect the site. Rio Tinto apologized in June. In a report published last month, the company said that it failed to meet some of its own standards in relation to the responsible management and protection of cultural heritage. But it didnt fire any executives  a decision that drew criticism from investor groups that accused the company of failing to take full responsibility for the demolition of the caves. The caves had significant archeological value and deep cultural meaning for Aboriginal people. In Fridays statement, Rio Tinto acknowledged that significant stakeholders have expressed concerns about executive accountability for the failings identified. Some advocacy groups in Australia welcomed Rio Tintos decision. This is just the first step on a long path towards restoring Rio Tintos good practice and reputation in its relationships with Indigenous peoples, James Fitzgerald, head of legal counsel and strategy at the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, said in a statement. The damage is irreparable, he added. We will need to hear from the [Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura] people as to whether they are satisfied with any reparations Rio Tinto has offered. The National Native Title Council, an organization representing the rights and interests of Indigenous custodial groups, also welcomed the departures. But this is not the end, CEO Jamie Lowe tweeted. Rio must now undertake an Aboriginal led review & large scale cultural change.",11/09/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/10/business/rio-tinto-ceo-intl-hnk/index.html
Trump twists history of Churchill and FDR to cover up pandemic denialism,"President Donald Trump is now not just downplaying the coronavirus  hes resorting to absurd historical allusions about great World War II leaders to try to disguise his culpability in 190,000 American deaths. Trump ridiculously invoked the former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and the President Franklin Delano Roosevelt at a Thursday night rally, claiming that like them, he had tried hard to calm public panic in a dark hour. It was a historically illiterate gambit, since unlike Trump in the pandemic, both statesmen leveled with their people about grave national crises. But it reflected his struggle to explain his failure to tell the American people the truth about the seriousness of the virus  even though he told Bob Woodward in interviews for his new book in February that it was deadly stuff. In a low-energy news conference earlier in the day, Trump doubled down on falsehood, declaring that I did not lie when he warned Woodward the pathogen was worse than the flu while publicly comparing it to the seasonal illness. In one stunning moment, he said that if the Washington Post reporter, whose book Rage comes out Tuesday, was so concerned about what was said in their taped conversations, he should have gone to the authorities so they could prepare the country. Of course, under the Constitution, the President is the ultimate authority and whether Trump likes it, the buck stops with him for the pandemic and every other national crisis. I dont want to jump up and down and start screaming death, death, Trump said, after Vice President Mike Pence bizarrely suggested Trumps negligence in fact typified a British propaganda campaign that was never widely used during the war and has become part of marketing kitsch in recent years: Keep Calm and Carry On. At his Michigan rally, Trump jumped on the metaphor, comparing himself to the wartime prime minister. We have to be calm. We dont want to be crazed lunatics. ... When Hitler was bombing London, Churchill, a great leader, would oftentimes go to a roof in London and speak. And he always spoke with calmness, Trump said, mangling the history of Churchills late night trips to view the raids with his separate radio addresses to the British people. The comparison doesnt hold up since Churchill left his country in no doubt of the challenge ahead when he became prime minister in 1940, warning of an ordeal of the most grievous kind and adding, We have before us many, many long months of struggle and suffering. Trump never came close to a similar steeling of national resolve at the start of the pandemic. His choice to look away from the threat and hope it would just pass actually has more in common with another British Prime Minister of the era, Neville Chamberlain, who elected not to confront the rising Nazi menace in 1938 in appeasement policies that many historians believe squandered a chance to stop Adolf Hitler before he reached a point of maximum danger. The President also ludicrously compared himself to Roosevelt, who told Americans in his inaugural address in 1933 that the only thing we have to fear, is fear itself. The quote was ripped out of context and is a poor match for Trumps denialism over the coronavirus. Unlike the current Presidents conduct in this crisis, Roosevelt didnt ignore the banking meltdown that he faced in the middle of the Great Depression. He explained it in understandable but powerful language to Americans and summoned them to a great national effort. Trump, by contrast, said that the pandemic wouldnt be a great problem and would just disappear, even though he knew full well how serious it was. Trumps meanderings were not just evidence of his slim grasp of history. They were the latest sign of how he has shirked his duty and minimized the current emergency. On Thursday, for instance, he urged New York City to go much faster after it announced that restaurants could soon begin serving food inside at 25% capacity after long and painful months slowly reducing the once out-of-control epidemic. At his evening rally, he called on Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, to open up her state. He urged schools to reopen and called for Big Ten college football to come back, cherry picking science about the impact of the virus on kids and ignoring their potential to infect their elders who are more at risk of complications. This was despite growing signs of the danger posed to teachers  three of whom recently died from Covid-19 complications. He disregarded 40,000 cases of Covid-19 already recorded in higher education with many institutions canceling football games and in-person classes. The administration has not furnished a national plan to help schools go back safely, other than US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines on reopening. It has also threatened to defund schools that dont get kids back in class. Flying to Michigan to greet several thousand maskless supporters packed together exemplified his defiance of his own governments guidelines for battling the pandemic. And Trumps admission to Woodward that he knew the virus was transmitted through the air back in February is training fresh scrutiny on his decision to hold a string of rallies through February and early March. The Presidents latest positions mirror those he took at the beginning of the summer when he goaded supportive state governors to open up their economies and mocked mask wearing, thereby helping set off a disaster in the Sun Belt. The impression then was the same as it is now: the President is desperate to restore at least an illusion of normality and to juice up the economy to boost his chances of reelection  ignoring the human cost of his actions. This is the single largest public health failure in the modern history of the United States, certainly, in the last hundred years, said Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor University. And it happened because of the refusal by the White House to launch a national campaign and a national strategy against the virus. So its beyond upsetting, Hotez told CNNs New Day. Trumps explanation that he had not wanted to panic Americans by explaining the true threat from the virus also came under severe examination. We could have had one-fifth the deaths weve have had, and part of this is a failure to communicate, Tom Frieden, the former director of the CDC, told CNNs Wolf Blitzer. We will pass 200,000 deaths in the beginning of October, by all estimates, and this is a number that is just almost inconceivable, Frieden said. This is an enormous number of people dying and its tragic to recognize that if we just had a more organized, well-led response with clear communication, many of those deaths could have been avoided. The Woodward revelations, piled on top of previous evidence of Trumps mishandling of the pandemic, are likely to have a devastating impact on the Presidents legacy. What is less certain less than eight weeks from Election Day is how they will affect his immediate political fortunes. There is little chance that after nearly four years of scandals, dramas and outrages, Trumps bond with his loyal voter base will be hurt. Proof of that can be read in the reaction from Republican lawmakers to the Woodward book and their unwillingness to criticize the President, apart from a few exceptions, like Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who has broken with Trump before and said the material was very, very, very concerning. Texas Sen. John Cornyn declined to comment since he had no personal knowledge of the Presidents remarks  even though they are on tape and have been playing on television for two days. North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, whos facing a tough reelection, told CNN, When youre in a crisis situation, you have to inform people for their public health but you also dont want to create hysteria. Democratic nominee Joe Biden launched a fresh attack on the President over his handling of the crisis that plays into the core argument of his campaign that Trump is temperamentally and intellectually unfit for office. He said theres no need for social distancing, dont bother wearing a mask. He actually went so far as to suggest it was a violation of American freedom to maintain you had to wear a mask, Biden told CNNs Jake Tapper in an exclusive interview. And look whats happened. Again, 190,000 dead and climbing. And whats he doing now? He still has not moved. The explosion over the Woodward books comes just two weeks after a Republican National Convention that made Trumps campaign strategy clear  avoid discussion of the pandemic at all costs. But as Trumps struggles on Thursday showed, hes finding it all but impossible to change the subject. For example, he could try to exploit Bidens vulnerabilities on trade and China. The former vice president voted to admit Beijing into the World Trade Organization as a senator and also supported the North America Free Trade agreement. Those positions offer an opening to Trump in a political climate that has turned against free trade agreements. But the grim and looming milestone of 200,000 US deaths from Covid-19 is likely to drown out the Presidents message within days. And with the first debate with Biden on September 29 fast approaching, time is dwindling for the President to get the campaign back onto ground he prefers.",11/09/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/11/politics/donald-trump-churchill-fdr-pandemic/index.html
"Covid-19 school closings linked to increase in depression and suicide, study finds","Primary school students in China experienced more depressive symptoms and made more suicide attempts after schools closed for the pandemic, a new study found. When Covid-19 hit China in January, the Ministry of Education postponed the start of spring semester to late April. That closure separated children from their friends and their broader community network, and seems to have had an impact on their mental well-being. The study, published Friday in JAMA Network Open, compared reports of mental health problems in November  before the pandemic started  to mid-May, two weeks into the new spring semester when schools had re-opened. Researchers from Anhui Medical University got results back from surveys for 1,241 students who were in grades 4 through 8, and in junior high. The kids lived in Chizhou, Anhui Province, an area that did not have a large number of Covid-19 cases. Nearly 25% of the students reported depressive symptoms in May, when only about 19% did in November. Suicide attempts more than doubled  at 6.4% in May compared to the 3% who made suicide attempts in November. There were no similar increases seen in reports of children who reported feeling an increase anxiety. Researchers hope school leaders will use this research to prepare the necessary mental health services to help children as they return to school following the lockdowns. This study is consistent with others that have found that enforced social isolation can cause mental health challenges for children. As states grappled with how to safely reopen schools earlier this year, the American Academy of Pediatrics led a push for students to be physically present in classrooms rather than continue in remote learning for the sake of their well-being. The group, which represents and guides pediatricians across the country, updated its back-to-school recommendations in June to say evidence shows the academic, mental and physical benefits of in-person learning outweigh the risks from the coronavirus. The AAP strongly advocates that all policy considerations for the coming school year should start with a goal of having students physically present in school, the group said on its website. The importance of in-person learning is well-documented, and there is already evidence of the negative impacts on children because of school closures in the spring of 2020. Lengthy time away from school and associated interruption of supportive services often results in social isolation, making it difficult for schools to identify and address important learning deficits as well as child and adolescent physical or sexual abuse, substance use, depression, and suicidal ideation, the group said. This overhaul of the traditional school day become reality in August, as schools in Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee and Indiana opened their doors for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic abruptly shuttered classrooms across the United States  all while the virus remained largely uncontrolled. More students and teachers tested positive for Covid-19, some schools were forced to suddenly change plans, while others opted to delay the start of the school year giving educators more time to prepare for in-person classes. What we do know is children have a harder time social distancing. And we cant put a whole bunch of them in a classroom with a teacher right now, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said in an August briefing announcing a delay. Other states that have tried to open this new school year are now having to close. We dont want to start and stop. That may be more difficult on our children, he said. Now, many have embraced virtual learning, which has posed its own set of challenges. Schools across the country have reported system outages, cyberattacks and other issues that prompted some districts to postpone the first day of class.

Ending the Iranian occupation,"Protesters in Lebanon and Iraq in the last year have turned their ire not only against conditions in their own countries, but against Irans corrosive influence in them. Past Palestinian protests in Gaza against the Iran-supported terrorist group Hamas, and protests in Iran itself, against the use of scarce Iranian resources for its leaders foreign malign expeditions, have voiced similar frustrations. Syria has been virtually destroyed by a now over nine-year civil war in which much of the population has fought the Iran-backed Syrian leadership. These flashpoints are revealing the fury of Arabs  and Iranians  with the leaders of the Iranian regime. They also reflect a changing Middle East: Notably, this anger is not being directed against Israel, even if the West has wrongfully long seen an Arab-Israeli divide as the regions fulcrum of conflict, but against Tehran. Now, yet another country has announced it will open diplomatic ties with Israel: After the US-brokered deal with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain has become the second Gulf state to normalize relations, a move that sends further shock waves through a region in which Arab countries have long resisted any diplomatic recognition of Israel. The Middle East is slowly being transformed by the combination of these anti-Iranian regime protests and the potential of peace agreements between Israel and some of its Arab neighbors, which are now tantalizingly within reach. The Abraham Accord between the United Arab Emirates and Israel  the name for the US-brokered agreement between the two countries to open normalized diplomatic relations  has shattered roadblocks between Israel and its Arab neighbors and has put an end to the veto card over progress in the region that the Palestinian leadership held for decades to the significant detriment of the region around them. The Bahrain announcement only underscores the seismic nature of how Middle East politics are changing as more countries recognize their common interests and the true threat to security in the region. The Abraham Accord was motivated in part by an Arab and Israeli concern with Irans unquenchable thirst for regional hegemony and nuclear weapons. While the UAE has said that the deal was not directed at Iran in particular, it is clear that the regional threat of Iran has become the foremost point of common interest for two countries situated at opposite ends of the Middle East. Indeed, as a result of entering into the Abraham Accord, the United Arab Emirates has now become an even a bigger target for Iran. The rest of the region is watching and waiting to see if they too can bring their nations to the table of peace and long-term prosperity. Some may follow the courageous lead of the UAE Crown Prince, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, and others may simply find it safer  or at least less complicated and less painless  to stay on the sidelines. But that would be to the detriment of their countries. (The Palestinian leadership, for its part, failed to get the Arab League to condemn the agreement.) Today, our focus must be on the Iranian Occupation: what I find to be the best term for Irans sprawling influence across the region, from its exertion of political influence in Iraq (via ties to Shia political actors and militias that are part of the official state security apparatus) to its support for Hamas in Gaza, to its long-standing backing of the terrorist group Hezbollah, to its involvement in the Syrian war to prop up the dictator Bashar al-Assad via its proxies. Those countries in the region who want to provide lasting safety, security and prosperity to their populations must act to contain the Iranian regime. In the United States and western Europe, complaints about so-called occupation have been misdirected for years against Israel. In reality, Arab populations have now developed a different concern: They recognize the brutal and devastating Iranian Occupation in Lebanon, Gaza, Iraq, Yemen and Syria. The new liberation movements in these Middle Eastern countries and Gaza do not emanate from the Arab left, are not directed against Israel, and are regionwide. American and Western European progressives hold outdated views. They would do well to shred these views and adjust to where the Arab and Iranian people are. An honest assessment of the approach of the West to the problem of the Palestinians since 1948 is that it has yielded years of empty resolutions at international organizations and conferences, and false, broken promises. It has trapped Palestinians in a time warp  those who are forced to live for decades in what are called refugee camps but seem in fact to be a permanent arrangement, those stuck and suffering under the brutal Hamas regime in Gaza and even those in the areas under the control of the Palestinian Authority who fare better than other Palestinians, but who are living nowhere near their potential or to a level that they deserve. Indeed, the Palestinians made real progress only when they reached agreements with Israel  on politics in Oslo in 1993 (though today most view the Oslo Accords as a failure) and on economics in Paris in April 1994. Today, because of the bold recommendations of President Donald Trump, the Palestinians have yet another opportunity for peace and a better future  one that is supported by the Prime Minister of Israel. Much of the West has not encouraged the Palestinian leadership to work with this offer to see where it can lead. In fact, many in the West have chosen to continue to make false promises to the Palestinians that ultimately are likely to be broken, again. These countries will continue to use their taxpayers hard-earned money simply as a way to keep kicking the can down the road instead of taking a look at hard truths and trying to effectuate real change. What a missed opportunity. Similarly, the West has ignored or never understood the plight of the Lebanese, Iraqis, Yemenis, and Iranians  and what they have in common with the Palestinians: They all suffer under Irans influence. Many of these peoples understand that the Iranian regime has produced only death, failure, poverty and sheer destruction across the Middle East. The cowardly opposition in the so-called UN Security Council on Aug. 21 to snapping back sanctions on Iran for its nuclear ambitions, is part and parcel of this terribly misguided approach. Arab and Iranian people have sounded a wake-up call. The United Arab Emirates, for instance, is now unafraid to say that Iran, not Israel, is the real regional threat. Others in the region should join them in calling this threat out  and indeed, it seems Bahrain may be well on its way to doing so. If todays announcement is any indication, more countries are acknowledging that they have more in common with Israel, and are more unified in aligning against Iran, than observers of the region have previously supposed. The West should discard its imperious attitude of telling the Middle East that it knows whats best for the region and instead should defer to the Middle East when it comes to the dangers the region itself faces most directly. It is time to hold the Iranian regime to account and demand an end to the Iranian regimes occupation, destruction and tyranny.",11/09/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/11/opinions/ending-the-iranian-occupation-greenblatt/index.html
LA mayor on Trump? response to wildfires: ?his is climate change?not just about forest management,"Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti on Sunday pushed back on President Donald Trumps frequent characterization of wildfires, like those currently ravaging the West Coast, as simply a forest management issue. Its been very clear that years of drought, as were seeing, whether its too much water and too much rain in parts of our country right now, or too little, Garcetti told CNNs Jake Tapper on State of the Union. This is climate change and this is an administration thats put its head in the sand. Slamming the administration as hosting the last vestiges of the flat Earth society of this generation, Garcetti called for real action. We need to reduce the carbon emissions that we have, and we need to make sure we can manage that water, he added. This is not about just forest management or raking. Anybody who lives here in California is insulted by that, quite frankly, and (Trump) keeps perpetrating this lie. Garcettis comments come a day after the White House announced Trump will visit California Monday. The President mentioned the wildfires during a speech at a rally Saturday night  after weeks of remaining largely silent on the historically devastating fires that have killed over two dozen people and burned more than 3 million acres in California   but did not speak on the climate crisis, an omission that is often a point of contention among his critics. Trump told rallygoers in Minden, Nevada, that the fires are about forest management, a characterization he has repeatedly offered of such blazes that has been previously criticized as inaccurate. Fact-checking Trumps California wildfire criticism It is about forest management, please remember the words, very simply, forest management, please remember, about forest management, and other things, he said, also thanking the firefighters and first responders who are reacting to the fires. Trump has pushed the familiar refrain for years while staying largely silent on climate change, despite scientists having long warned that fire seasons like this could happen, and that the more humans heat up the planet, the higher the odds in favor of the hot, dry conditions conducive to blazes. After 2018s deadly Camp fire, Trump said that the forest floor should have been raked out. Theyre starting again in California, Trump said at a rally in mid-August. I said, you gotta clean your floors, you gotta clean your forests  there are many, many years of leaves and broken trees and theyre like, like, so flammable, you touch them and it goes up. About 20% of California is made up of national forests, according to the US Department of Agriculture Forest Service. Garcetti on Sunday also asked that Trump respond to issues in Democratic-leaning cities and states just as he would in Republican ones, saying he believes they are treated unequally. I think leadership at the very top needs to be earlier, stronger, and from the President I wish that we would get as much attention not based on an electoral map but just purely on being Americans, Garcetti told Tapper. And the need for leadership to be from the White House for all of America, you know whether its twin hurricanes on the Gulf Coast or fires here on the West Coast, were one nation. In a subsequent interview on State of the Union, White House Trade Adviser Peter Navarro called Garcettis allegation that the administration acts with political motivation in offering federal aid to states affected by natural disasters offensive, pointing to the efforts the President took to assist the state of New York during the coronavirus pandemic. Everything that New York wanted, they got. So, please, Mr. Garcetti, take care of Los Angeles better than you are doing, Navarro said. Earlier, Garcetti acknowledged and thanked the Trump administration for declaring a State of Emergency in the state three weeks ago due to the fires. Its easy to forget that its taken three weeks. Im glad hes coming, but we need much more help when we have firefighters dying on the line and Washington refuses to help states and refuses to help local governments that are the first responders to emergencies like this, its unconscionable. California wasnt the only state Sunday voicing concerns over leadership on climate change in light of the wildfires. The President has said its all about raking the forest, its just a big and devastating lie, Democratic Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley told ABCs George Stephanopoulos when asked about Trumps comments. Environmental changes such as drier forests are consequences of a warming planet, Merkley continued. We need to have a president now who follows the science on global warming, he added. Democratic Oregon Gov. Kate Brown told CBS News on Sunday that the wildfires should serve a a wake-up call. This is truly the bellwether for climate change on the West Coast, Brown said. And this is a wake-up call for all of us that we have got to do everything in our power to tackle climate change. This story has been updated with comments from Peter Navarro, Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley and Oregon Gov. Kate Brown.",13/09/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/13/politics/west-coast-fires-eric-garcetti-climate-change-cnntv/index.html
Washington Post: NOAA taps climate change skeptic to help lead agency,"A longtime climate change skeptic has been appointed by the Trump administration to help run the federal agency charged with producing much of the climate research funded by the government, The Washington Post reported Sunday. David Legates, who was a professor at the University of Delaware before being tapped by the administration, will serve as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations deputy assistant secretary of commerce for environmental observation and prediction, according to the Post, which said the climate change skeptic will report directly to acting NOAA Administrator Neil Jacobs. CNN has reached out to Legates on the reported appointment. The executive director/CEO of the nonprofit American Geophysical Union, whose website claims 60,000 members, urged in a blog post Monday evening that the appointment be rescinded. With climate change producing raging wildfires in the western United States and devastating hurricanes in the Atlantic, our nation  and the world  cannot afford to have our federal government undermining the important work of climate scientists, Randy Fiser wrote. Legates appointment not only threatens our ability to combat the climate crisis and protect our planet for future generations, it undermines scientific integrity at NOAA. The Post said Legates formerly served as Delawares climatologist but was forced out because of his controversial views on the issue. The newspaper said that Legates had come under pressure from then-Gov. Ruth Ann Minner (D), because of his fossil fuel industry-funded research casting doubt on the science showing that burning coal, oil and other fossil fuels is the main factor behind heating the planet and would lead to dangerous effects such as sea level rise and extreme weather events. Legates spoke about some of his views during a hearing before the House Natural Resources Committee in 2019, claiming that carbon dioxide isnt the only thing contributing to changes in the planets temperature. Carbon dioxide is not this magic knob that decides the temperature of the planet. In particular, theres an awful lot of other things that happen with it, too. The plant does not warm like a greenhouse, thats simply pure radiation balance, Legates testified during the hearing. In response to questions from Republican Rep. Tom McClintock of California, Legates said that although the planet is experiencing some of the highest recorded temperatures in the last 150 years, it has little to do with carbon dioxide, but instead has to do with the demise of the little ice age and warming conditions due to an increasing sun. Climate scientists largely agree that carbon dioxide is warming the planet, and that human activity, like the burning of fossil fuels for energy, has increased the gas to dangerous levels. Other gasses, like methane, are also responsible for some of the human-causes warming we see today. NOAA oversees weather forecasting, climate research and fisheries, according to the Post, and has until now continued its climate research and communications activities unfettered by political influence, unlike other parts of the administration, like the Environmental Protection Agency, that have dismissed and sidelined climate scientists or altered their work before publication.

The climate crisis could be making Hurricane Sally worse. Here? how,"Scientists believe global warming is influencing hurricanes and making their impacts worse. And Hurricane Sally looks to be checking all their boxes. Heres how: Sally officially experienced rapid intensification, a term that refers to a storms maximum sustained winds increasing at least 35 mph in 24 hours or less, according to the National Hurricane Center. Sally saw top winds increase from 60 to 100 mph in 12 hours, from 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday. Rapid intensification is one way scientists believe the climate crisis is impacting hurricanes, with warmer waters helping storms grow stronger and do so faster. Hurricanes Hanna and Laura earlier this year also rapidly intensified before making landfall in Texas and Louisiana, respectively. Rapid intensification is especially dangerous when in happens in the 24 to 48 hours before a storm reaches land. Thats because you can go to bed at night anticipating a Category 1, then wake up to a Category 3 major hurricane that brings impacts far worse than earlier anticipated. And that is exactly what weve seen with Sally, Laura and Hanna. Sally is moving at 2 mph  slower than the average human walking pace. Hurricanes and tropical storms are moving slower around the planet, says a study from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientist James Kossin, who analyzed hundreds of storms in all basins over decades. The slower a storm moves, the more rain it can drop on a particular area, and the longer severe winds have to weaken infrastructure. There was a 10% decrease globally in storms forward speed between 1949 and 2016, though there was some variation among ocean basins, the 2018 study in the scientific journal Nature showed. Recent storms that have devastated the US  such as Hurricane Harvey in Texas and Hurricane Florence in the Carolinas  have moved extremely slow, allowing for massive rainfall totals and flooding. It looks like Sally will follow that trend. Historic flooding is possible with Sally, the National Hurricane Center said, because of the amount of rain that is forecast over 48 hours beginning Tuesday. Scientists are very confident the climate crisis is making storm rainfall worse by increasing the rate at which it falls, as well as the amount of rain a storm can produce. Simply put, warmer air holds more water vapor, said Kossin, an atmospheric research scientist at NOAAs National Centers for Environmental Information. Gulf of Mexico water temperatures are largely above average, and the Northern Hemisphere just experienced its hottest summer on record. That allows storms like Sally to hold more moisture and produce more rain. With Sally, three to four months worth of rain could fall before the storm leaves the region Thursday.",15/09/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/15/weather/climate-change-hurricane-sally/index.html
Climate is not weather: Trump continues to get the two conflated,"Parts of the US are indeed facing record cold temperatures. But, as cold as it is, all this talk of global warming is not overblown. Just as he has tried at times with the Covid-19 pandemic, President Trumps solution to climate change seems to be to wish it away. When presented with facts by Gov. Gavin Newsom of California and then Wade Crowfoot, secretary of Californias Natural Resources Agency, about how warming temperatures brought on by the burning of fossil fuels worsened the wildfires, President Donald Trump just shrugged it off and again doubted the consensus of every major scientific organization that studies out planet. I dont think science knows, actually, the President said at the briefing on the California wildfires that have destroyed millions of acres in recent weeks. With climate change, it is the difference between weather and climate that continually trips him up. He is right that yes, it will get cooler. We are heading into winter in the US  and all the global warming in the world wont change Earths annual trip around the sun or its tilt, which brings about the change in seasons. But that doesnt mean an end to global warming. As he has done in the past, Trump is once again conflating seasonal weather with climate  and ignoring the planets long-term warming trend. Trump has repeatedly suggested that a cold day or snowstorm must mean climate change is no longer occurring. His Twitter account is littered with where the hell is global warming, tweets, most likely during a winter snowstorm wherever he is located. We do not see those tweets, however, when an area the size of Connecticut is burning in the California, the result of the hottest summer the Northern Hemisphere has ever seen and years of increasing temperatures and decreasing rainfall. People at all levels struggle with the difference between weather and climate, Marshall Shepherd, an atmospheric scientist and director of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Georgia, told CNN. One of the most common science literacy mistakes is to assume a cold day or seasonal transition somehow describes climate. Thats like saying a baseball player getting one hit is now leading the league in batting average, Shepherd said. Weather is what happens today. Climate is what happens over the long run. Heres how NASA explains it: Weather is the condition in the atmosphere over a short period of time. Climate is how the atmosphere behaves over relatively long periods of time. CNN meteorologist Chad Myers clarified the same point when Trump made a similar quip last year, doubting climate change because of cold weather. People also tend to confuse what is happening where they live as an indication of what is happening globally, says Marshall Shepherd, director of the Atmospheric Sciences Program at the University of Georgia and a former president of the American Meteorological Society. It is not Where You Live Warming, it is Global Warming, Shepherd told CNN. So thats why global warming is still a thing, even when it seems like the winter weather reigns supreme. Major scientific agencies such as the UNs Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the US National Climate Assessment agree in their latest reports that even if all greenhouse gas emissions came to a screeching halt, global warming would continue for decades  though the rate and severity could certainly be lessened by aggressively turning away from fossil fuels. As for next year being cooler  unlikely. The five hottest years in the planets history have been the last five  this year will almost certainly place in the top five. The last time the planet even had a month that was cooler than average? That would be 428 months ago, in 1985. So, no  the climate is not getting cooler anytime soon, and yes, the science knows.",16/09/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/15/weather/global-warming-vs-weather-trump/index.html
The pandemic didn? solve climate change. This week? disasters are proof,"If you thought Covid-19 restrictions, like enforced lockdowns and social distancing, would put a lasting dent in our collective carbon footprint and save the world from warming, you were mistaken. Earlier this year, in the midst of a horrific news cycle and a rapidly mounting death toll, that notion was a welcome silver lining to the pandemic. As people around the world stayed at home to stop the spread of the coronavirus, greenhouse gas emissions from the energy and transport industries plummeted, dropping to record lows. But it may have given some a false sense that the worst effects of climate change were being mitigated. Theyre not. Just in the last week, we learned that massive glaciers are tearing loose from the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, driven by increasingly high temperatures at the poles, and, in turn, accelerating sea level rise and posing enormous threats to the millions of people living in coastal areas. Meanwhile, devastating wildfires, fueled by hot, dry winds and tinderbox conditions, have scorched millions of acres across the western United States, triggering mass evacuations, claiming dozens of lives and sending smoke haze billowing across the country, as far as Europe. If that wasnt enough, the Atlantic is also having one of its busiest hurricane seasons on record, spurred by warm sea surface temperatures. To give you a sense of just how busy: Hurricane Sally, which blew ashore as a Category 2 hurricane early Wednesday in Alabama, was one of five tropical cyclones in the Atlantic on Monday  a phenomenon thats happened only once before, almost 50 years ago. All of these extreme weather events can be linked to global warming, caused by rising levels of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, mainly from humans burning fossil fuels. Theyre grim reminders that the world has a much bigger existential crisis on its hands than Covid-19. And it will take a lot more than a few months of forgoing air and car travel to stop it. Climate change is not stopping because of lockdowns, said Ilan Kelman, a professor of risk, resilience and global health at University College London. The extreme weather which we are witnessing is not excessive in terms of the history of humanity ... it is very much in line with what we would expect under climate change. But Donald Trump might have you believe otherwise. Earlier this week, the US President seemed to question whether climate change was fanning the flames raging up and down the West Coast  despite scientific evidence showing that global warming is increasing the odds in favor of extreme wildfire weather. He also claimed it would soon start to get cooler. From a president who has referred to global warming as a hoax in the past, it was yet another statement reflecting his climate denial. Asked to respond to Trumps comments, Imperial College London climate scientist Joeri Rogelj, a lead author on the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports, said he wasnt sure how he could. Of course, we are in the Northern Hemisphere, so we are now entering autumn, and then it will be winter, so yes it will be cooler again. But that is not what climate change is about, Rogelj said. It is instead about long-term trends. Trends that show our planet is not cooling at all. In fact, its getting hotter than ever before  and fast. The IPCC has established this unequivocally, that the planet will continue to warm as long as we are emitting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and at present even with the small blip of Covid reductions, we are still emitting billions of tons, Rogelj added. Scientists agree that climate change is driving average global temperatures up, changing climatic conditions around the globe  how warm it is, how dry it is, how much rain falls  and that means changes to the weather patterns that we experience too. Take forest fires, for example. There is a great deal of evidence that climate change results in tinderbox conditions, very extended dry and warm periods. So, when fires start, they tend to burn more intensely and cover wider areas. And, its not just the air that has warmed  so too have the worlds oceans. That heat is fueling hurricanes, which are becoming stronger and more intense as a result. Scientists say that warmer oceans and atmosphere are also to blame for the melting ice sheets and calving glaciers. The climate change that were experiencing today  evidenced by extreme weather events like the West Coast wildfires  is the net result of our cumulative emissions since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. So, even if annual carbon emissions go down in any given year, as they have during the pandemic, as long as we are adding greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, the planet will continue to warm. Under the 2015 Paris climate accord, countries committed to reduce their carbon output and halt global warming below 2 degrees Celsius  and if possible, below 1.5 degrees Celsius  to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Trump announced in 2017 he would pull the US out of the accord, a move that that will lead to a complete withdrawal just after this years presidential election. Meeting that goal means halving annual emissions by about 2030  and then bringing them to zero within another 20 years. And even then, the world will not have halted climate change, it will only have stopped it from getting worse. Rogelj, who has been studying the climate impact of Covid-19, describes lockdowns as a temporary blip on the radar. People have made a huge sacrifice, they have sacrificed their social lives, their family interactions their mobility and so on. And emissions have declined quite markedly because of that. But we also see that these emission reductions are very temporary, said Rogelj, adding that theyre already going up again. And why is that? Its because these emissions reductions were the result of changing or reducing our activities, but not the cause of any structural change of how our society actually works. Doing that will require a long-term transition and transformation of our society to low-carbon and renewable energy, from how we get around, to how we generate energy. Kelman, whose book, Disaster by Choice, looks at how our actions turn natural hazards into catastrophes, says that though lockdowns may not have made a big impact on mitigating the climate crisis in the long term, they have shown that change is possible. Weve been told for a long time that changing society overnight is not possible. What lockdown showed is that it is, said Kelman. But he warned that lockdowns are not a sustainable solution to curbing climate change, pointing to the economic, societal and social costs theyve inflicted. This has been, to some extent, been a test run of the positives and negatives, the possibilities and the harm. What we need to ensure is that we are helping people, we are creating jobs, we are supporting livelihoods, at the same time as reducing all forms of consumption. And this should not happen overnight.",18/09/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/18/weather/coronavirus-lockdowns-climate-change-extreme-weather-intl/index.html
A Florida panther sculpture melts before visitors?eyes to highlight the effects of climate change,"Orange wax streams down the back of a sculpture of a Florida panther, sending a message. She will soon be gone, leaving her cub behind. The melting wax panther is an artistic metaphor for the toll human-caused climate change is taking on Floridas wildlife and people. And scientists say it could get even worse. A record hurricane season, coastal flooding, rising temperatures and long stretches of extreme heat are just some of the ways climate change is playing out in the Sunshine State. The piece of artivism is part of the Florida Climate Crisis Campaign by The CLEO Institute, a nonprofit focusing on climate science education in Florida, and the VoLo Foundation. We are having a very hyperactive hurricane season and we have run out of names to name them. We are experiencing increased temperatures and increased sea level as well, Yoca Arditi-Rocha, executive director of The CLEO Institute, told CNN. For us the climate crisis is very relevant and its impacting Floridians in so many ways. The panther sculpture debuted at ZooTampa on Friday to depict how the habitat of endangered species is affected. It is one of three installations being placed in different cities. Artist and director Bob Partington created the three wax sculptures, which were commissioned by Miami-based advertising agency Zubi. Each sculpture is meant to melt over a few days, slowly revealing a message about climate change. Wax was chosen to emphasize the increasing temperatures in Florida, Arditi-Rocha said. The first artwork was a wax sculpture of a lifeguard hut like the ones you see on Floridas beaches. Installed in Miami, it represents Floridas tourism industry and its quality of life. The artwork melted to reveal this message: More Heat, Less Beaches. Miami saw a record summer with weeks of intense heat. Seven of the 10 hottest weeks on record have occurred in 2020 and that was before August, when temperatures traditionally peak in the city. The final wax sculpture, to be unveiled in front of Orlandos city hall this week, will show a man and his granddaughter sitting on a bench. The artwork is meant to make people question what will be left of Floridas natural wonders for future generations, The CLEO Institute said in a press release. The idea of these icons is to highlight things that all Floridians really want to protect and treasure, Arditi-Rocha said. While climate change is a global issue, the CLEO Institute is hoping that Floridians take a look at what they love about their state and work to save it. Our passion to save our way of living here in Florida is widely shared among so many of us, Arditi-Rocha said. We know this is a topic that has been tremendously politicized, but everyone wants to protect our beautiful beaches, our biodiversity and our way of living.

A British teenager staged a sit-in on an Arctic ice floe to protest climate change,"A British teenager has staged a protest against climate change inside the Arctic Circle. In the worlds most northerly climate strike, Mya-Rose Craig, a passionate ornithologist and nature, climate and equal rights campaigner, was photographed protesting on an ice floe at the Arctic ice edge, north of Svalbard, at 82.2 North earlier this week. The 18-year-old, who lives near the southwestern English city of Bristol, held up a placard saying Youth Strike for Climate. She spent five hours on the ice, a spokesperson for environmental organization Greenpeace told CNN. Craig, who says on her Twitter page that she is the youngest person to have seen half the worlds birds, arrived in the Arctic on board the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise as part of an expedition documenting the impact of the climate crisis and investigating marine life in the region. The journey, which started from Norway in early September, was timed to coincide with next weeks United Nations Summit on Biodiversity, where marine protection should be front and center to any discussions about protecting biodiversity, Greenpeace said in a statement. September 25 has been declared a global climate action day by Fridays for Future, a global strike movement that started in August 2018, when Greta Thunberg, then aged 15, launched her climate protest. In a statement issued by Greenpeace, Craig said: Im here because I want to see for myself whats at stake as this crucial protector of the planet, the Arctic Ocean, melts away at a terrifying rate. Today, myself and Fridays For Future activists from all over the world are standing up to call for urgent action against climate breakdown. Im here to demand that our leaders come together and create ocean sanctuaries to protect this essential but fragile place and at least 30 per cent of our oceans. There is still time to turn things around towards more sustainable energies and lifestyles, and that moment must be now. Craig told CNN that the trip had been a once in a lifetime experience, in more ways than one. It feels like a once in a lifetime experience, not only because it has been an amazing trip, but also because I am hyper-aware that the Arctic is disappearing. I have been a climate activist for years but now it has really sunk in just how urgent this issue is. Looking out from the ship it was so easy to picture it all slowly melting and disappearing in the coming two decades. Earlier this week, scientists from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) at the University of Colorado Boulder said the Arctic sea ice, or the floating ice cover of the Arctic Ocean, had reached its minimum extent for the year, shrinking to the second lowest extent since record-keeping began in 1978. Craig, who has just finished high school, is taking a year out before studying politics and international relations at university next year. According to Greenpeace, she is one of millions of youth activists and climate strikers demanding action and accountability from global leaders in tackling the commodification of nature for profit. Earlier this year she shared a platform with Thunberg, addressing 40,000 people in Bristol. On why young people like herself and Thunberg are demonstrating, she told CNN: I really wanted to convey how, as a young person, I feel incredibly desperate about this issue and I feel its extremely urgent. It makes me really angry when politicians and world leaders dont take action on climate change  it isnt their future thats melting down the drain. This movement of young people has been so exciting to me. It has the potential to be revolutionary because protests and strikes like this are finally giving young people a voice. People are finally sitting down and listening to us about how we feel about our future. Posting on Facebook earlier Friday, Craig wrote: It has taken me weeks to travel by road and boat to the Arctic edge to bear witness to the Sea Ice Minimum, the lowest level of the ice at the end of each summer. Today, I took part in the most northerly Youth Strike ever, to bear witness to the low ice level and ask you to amplify my voice and those of other young people around the world and demand that our leaders take action now when they meet at the UN General Assembly soon.",25/09/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/25/europe/teenage-protester-arctic-scn-scli-intl-climate/index.html
"How environmental conditions like cold and wet weather can affect pandemics, and what that means for COVID-19","Numerous scientists have studied how the 1918 flu spread to become the deadliest pandemic in history and which interventions worked, research that is becoming increasingly relevant during the current coronavirus crisis. But little research has been done on how environmental conditions affected the 1918 pandemic  until now. The 1918 flu coincided with the final years of the World War I, and its been well documented that heavy rain and cold temperatures impacted many battles. Now, a new study reveals that the cold, rainy weather was part of a once-in-a-century climate anomaly that occurred from 1914 to 1919 and added to the severity of the 1918 pandemic. We knew before, of course, from photos and eyewitness testimonies that the battlefields of Europe were really muddy and rainy and soldiers died of all sorts of exposure, even drowning in the mud and the trenches sometimes. What is news is that in fact it was a six-year anomaly and not just one or two instances, said lead researcher Alexander More, a research associate at Harvard Universitys history department and an assistant professor at the University of Maines Climate Change Institute. A team of more than a dozen scientists collected and analyzed an Alpine ice core to reconstruct the environmental conditions of Europe during the World War I. The process involves using a laser that melts a tiny bit from the ice surface and analyzing the chemicals released from each layer of water vapor. Its so precise they can pinpoint exact seasons from each layer of ice. Researchers then compared that ice core data to historical records of deaths during that time period and records of precipitation and temperatures from each month. The researchers discovered that lingering cold, wet weather during the winters of 1915, 1916 and 1918 was caused by abnormally high rushes of marine air from the North Atlantic. Deaths in Europe peaked three times during World War I and all the spikes occurred during or soon after heavy rain and cold weather, according to the study. The rain basically matches how many people died. Theres a double peak in the fall of 1918, which is when the second wave and the most lethal wave of the Spanish flu occurred, said More, also an associate professor of public health at Long Island University. So of course as were looking at the second wave of Covid right now and what will happen ... this is a warning of what may come. The study also shows that this six-year atmospheric anomaly may have disrupted the migratory patterns of several bird species during the war years, including mallard ducks, which are the main animal hosts of H1N1 flu viruses. That meant more Mallard ducks remained in Europe, where they could continue to transmit the flu to humans through water contaminated with bird droppings. Its interesting to think that very heavy rainfall may have accelerated the spread of the virus, said Philip Landrigan, director of the Global Public Health Program at Boston College, who is unaffiliated with the new study. One of the things weve learned in the Covid pandemic is that viruses seem to stay viable for longer in humid air than in dry air. So it makes sense that if the air in Europe was full of humidity during those years of World War I, that the transmission of the virus might have been accelerated. The research on 1918 has eerie similarities to the current crisis, as many parts of the world appear to be entering a second wave of Covid-19, or remain in a prolonged first wave of the virus. Not only are many parts of the Northern Hemisphere starting to see less warm and sunny weather in the transition to fall, but climate change continues to have adverse effects across the globe. For example, the Atlantic is experiencing one of its busiest hurricane seasons on record. It is really the convergence of our two major crises  man-made climate change and infectious disease, More said. Absolutely, climate is going to affect the likelihood of infectious disease outbreaks. It has in the past and it will in the future. According to More, the same patterns created by climate anomalies that affected the severity and spread of the 1918 flu pandemic are happening right now. And Covid-19 is not the only infectious disease impacted by climate change. Many other ongoing epidemics are affected by climate and especially man-made climate change. For example, zika and dengue fever are transmitted by mosquitoes, and now those mosquitoes are reaching places that they never reached before, he said. The same can be said about other bacteria and diseases throughout the world. In an unprecedented year that seems to bring one crisis after another, climate scientists say that its important to look at the connections between them, and how climate-related issues such as extreme weather, storm surges, wildfires, and homelessness created in the wake of natural disasters can create adverse conditions that allow infectious diseases to spread more easily. Theres no question that they are connected, More said, adding that more interdisciplinary research is needed to better understand the links between climate change and pandemics.",28/09/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/28/health/climate-affects-pandemics-new-study-trnd-scn/index.html
Brazilian court blocks government? decision to revoke key mangrove protections,"A Brazilian court blocked governments move to revoke key regulations protecting the countrys tropical mangroves after the move was fiercely criticized by environmental and climate groups. The decision by the court came just a day after Brazils National Environment Council, known as Conama, voted to overturn the measures that had defined the ecosystems along Brazils coastline as permanent preservation areas and restricted commercial development projects. Environment Minister Ricardo Salles defended the move and said the changes provided greater balance in order to protect the environment. This government is concerned with the environment, with people and with sustainable economic development, Salles told CNN affiliate CNN Brasil during an interview Monday. You cant create legislation that is so excessive that it asphyxiates the economic sector completely. Federal judge Maria Amelia Almeida Senos de Carvalho overturned the decision Tuesday, saying the repeal of violated the constitutional right to an ecologically balanced environment. Considering the evident risk of irretrievable damage to the environment, I defer the anticipation of the effects of the protection to suspend the effects of the revocation, she said in the judgment. Mangroves are trees and shrubs that grow along tropical coastlines. They are rooted underwater in salty sediments, thriving in conditions few other plants can withstand. They tend to have large root systems that protect coastal areas from erosion and act as a bridge between the ocean and land. They are a home to numerous species of sea birds and are considered nursery habitats because they provide safe haven for young fish, crabs and shrimp. Crucially, mangroves are also some of the worlds most effective carbon sinks, absorbing more carbon dioxide per area than rainforests. By removing the greenhouse gas from the atmosphere, mangroves are playing an important part in climate change mitigation. According to the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO, mangroves, sea grasses and other marine living organisms capture more than half of the worlds biological carbon. The commission estimates that these ecosystems absorb the equivalent of more than half of the emissions from the entire global transport sector each year. Critics said removing the protections by Brazil would endanger an essential part of the global fight against climate change and the preservation of Brazils Atlantic coastline. Greenpeace said the decision was an example of calculated environmental destruction in Brazil. Carlos Bocuhy, the president of the Brazilian Institute of Environmental Protection (PROAM), called it the worst attack carried out by the Federal Government against the environment. As the world witnesses the exponential burning of the Amazon and the Pantanal region, two of the worlds richest and most important biomes, in shock  Conama now opens the door to eliminate the rules that protect the mangroves and vegetation of our countrys coastline, Bocuhy wrote in an op-ed. Bocuhy, who had previously been a member of the National Environment Council, was removed last year when the government reduced the seats from 96 members to 23. Bocuhy and others said the reducation was done, partially, in order for the federal government to have ultimate majority over the Council that is a key voice in the countrys environmental regulations. The government of President Jair Bolsonaro has been widely criticized for its approach to environmental regulations. In May, a video of a governmental meeting showed Salles, the environment minister, saying that the government should take advantage of the medias focus on the Covid-19 pandemic to loosen the environmental restrictions. The video from April 22 was disclosed during an investigation by the Supreme Court into allegations that Bolsonaro was trying to interfere with the Federal Police. The quote from Salles caught the medias attention. There is a need to have an effort on our side here, while we are at this moment of tranquility in terms of press coverage, because it only talks about Covid, and let the cattle herd run and change all the rules and simplifying standards, he said. Later, in an exclusive interview with CNN Brasil, Salles defended his stance saying it was aimed at reducing bureaucracy. What I defended in the meeting were regulations that do not need to go through Congress [to be approved], he said. Bolsonaro has also rejected criticism of his governments environmental policy, even as data from his own agency shows a growing problem, especially in the Amazon and the Pantanal. In 2019, his first year in office, Brazils National Institute for Space Research (INPE) counted 126,089 fires in the Amazon  a rise of nearly 40% over the year before he took office. And despite a government ban on fires in the Amazon imposed in mid-July, INPE reported more fires in August and September than in the same period a year ago. INPE data also showed fires raging in the Pantanal, home to alligators, jaguars and many other animals. By mid-September, it had registered 16,119 heat spots in Pantanal in 2020, the most since 1998, when the institute started keeping record. Yet Bolsonaro has remained defiant. Addressing UN member states in a pre-recorded address last week, Bolsonaro accused foreign actors of a brutal disinformation campaign about the supposed degradation of the Amazon as well as Brazils Pantanal wetlands.",29/09/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/29/americas/brazil-revokes-mangroves-protection-climate-intl/index.html
Let? talk about the climate apocalypse,"When the winds of a storm in the Atlantic Ocean reach a certain speed  39 mph  that storm is given a human name from a list created by the World Meteorological Organization. This act of naming is no accident. In general, humans care about other humans, so when we humanize something inanimate, it makes us care about the thing more, Adam Waytz, a professor at Northwestern University, told National Geographic recently. Naming things can make them more memorable, easier to recall, and certainly it makes things feel more fluent or easy to process. Given that work shows that easily processed information takes on outsized importance in our minds, it is likely that naming things can give them importance as well. No longer, though, thanks to 2020. This is only the second year the World Meteorological Organization has run out of human names  the Andrews, Marias and Sandys that haunt the communities they attack, for decades  for storms in the Atlantic. (The other time this happened was 2005, which saw Katrina, Rita and other monster storms.) The backup protocol, in the event that an alphabetical list of 21 human names is exhausted, is to dip into the less accessible Greek alphabet. Witness the 2020 storms that were named Alpha and Beta, and so on. I bring this up not only because its a very 2020 occurrence to run out of hurricane names. This year seems to have been all the things, almost none of them pleasant. I bring it up because unnatural disasters like these Atlantic storms, which we know are supercharged by global warming, are becoming so frequent and so dangerous that they almost have a numbing effect on our collective psyche  the opposite of the intended effect of naming storms in the first place. Rather than Arthur, we have Alpha, which feels detached in a high-school-physics kind of way. Were at the point where even storm names are becoming alphabet soup. The fires in Western mountains, the violent windstorms in Iowa cornfields, the storms in the Atlantic. All of these disastrous events once were scarce enough that we typically could keep track of them  at the very least, their names, if not their locations and on-the-ground consequences. How many among us  putting aside those most intimately affected  can name the myriad wildfires burning in California, Oregon and Washington? Perhaps naming those fires for humans, rather than locations, would help. But I fear that as we become increasingly trapped in a revolving door of climate-related disasters, well become numb  more numb than we already are  to the magnitude of whats actually happening. This fear is a feeling that  as my years of reporting on climate and climate disasters have shown me  many around the world share, even if they dont have the exact words to express it. Maybe thats you. Or maybe youre too tired or worried or just so overwhelmed these days that it only occurs to you late at night, when the kids are asleep or youre alone and theres no one to talk to. Or maybe your thoughts about climate disaster may not be exactly welcome among friends or family where you live. Thats one reason Im inviting you to send your questions about the climate crisis over coming weeks. Ill do some reporting and answer them to the best of my ability. Lets name this thing. Talk about it. Make sense of it. The climate emergency is too big for just one conversation, so were going to have an ongoing back-and-forth throughout the fall. Ill answer your questions on a variety of themes concerning the climate crisis, from politics to history. Lets start, though, with 2020, this year of extreme weather  fires, droughts, storms, floods and more. What do you want to know about extreme weathers relationship to the climate crisis, or what can be done about it? Later this fall, we will go on to address climate changes increasingly tangled and thorny relationship with migration; the history of global warming politics; sea-level rise on the American coasts; and solutions to this often-overlooked planetary emergency. The truth is, we dont have to be paralyzed by the magnitude of this crisis. There are workable solutions  were just not pursuing them, or not doing so anywhere near the economy-shifting scale (or the planet-saving speed) that the science of global warming requires. Another reason to hear from you is that far too few of us are engaging in this conversation at all. A recent survey from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication found that only a third of Americans talk at least occasionally about the climate crisis. Even fewer  a quarter  hear about it once a week in the media. I have a feeling that many of those of us who are trying to engage are yelling past each other as frequently as were actually having a conversation. So to all of us, even if its hard  lets have a dialogue, starting now. I look forward to your questions and to talking more with you about all things climate.",13/10/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/13/opinions/lets-talk-about-climate-change-apocalypse-sutter/index.html
This company thinks its plastic alternative can help solve climate change,"For companies around the world and across industries, sustainability has rapidly gone from a nice-to-have to a business imperative. Global brands including Amazon (AMZN), McDonalds (MCD), Ikea and General Motors have announced ambitious plans to eliminate single-use plastics, reduce carbon emissions and otherwise shrink their environmental footprint in various ways. Newlight Technologies hopes to speed up that process with a biodegradable material that can be molded like plastic. The California-based company has spent more than a decade developing a material it calls AirCarbon, which it says functions exactly like plastic but is completely biodegradable. Newlight developed the material using microorganisms found in the ocean that feed on methane and carbon dioxide  two greenhouse gases among the biggest contributors to climate change. The organisms turn those gasses into a natural polymer that can be shaped or molded just like plastic. We call that AirCarbon because its air and carbon dissolved in water, CEO Mark Herrema told CNNs Rachel Crane. We have this pure white powder that we can then melt and form in all kinds of parts and pieces. The companys new production facility in Huntington Beach is filled with large saltwater tanks that recreate ocean conditions, allowing the organisms to replicate the process of making the polymer from which AirCarbon can be extracted. Newlight recently began rolling out its first set of products made from the material, launching two retail brands aimed at two of the worlds most polluting industries. Its foodware brand, Restore, sells biodegradable straws and cutlery, while its fashion brand Covalent sells handbags, wallets and sunglasses. And because the process of developing AirCarbon uses gasses from the atmosphere, the products are carbon negative, meaning they take out more pollutants than they use. Newlight has received carbon negative certifications for its products from independent third parties, including the UK-based Carbon Trust and environmental certification firm SCS Global Services. It has also been recognized for environmentally friendly innovations by US regulators such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Newlight is also trying to let customers know exactly how much carbon the product they just bought is eliminating. The company has partnered with IBM to use its blockchain technology to track every step of the manufacturing process and its carbon footprint. Most people want to do something good, right? And the problem has been a lack of information, Herrema said. When you go up and you look at buying that t-shirt, you dont know that theres 700 liters of water that was used just to make that t-shirt. If you knew that this one was 700 liters and this one was seven, that may impact your decision making. So we want to do the same thing on the carbon side. Newlights biggest challenge will likely be scaling up production fast enough to keep prices down. Its current product offerings range from a cutlery set for $6.99 to a handbag for $520  a little costlier than some traditional equivalents currently available on the market. The company has just the one facility, which makes enough AirCarbon products to remove the equivalent of 100 million pounds of carbon dioxide per year  which Herrema says is roughly equivalent to taking 6,000 cars off the road. But his goal is to build more facilities as quickly as possible and eventually increase that number to 20 billion pounds, which he says is how much plastic ends up in the ocean each year. If you really want to have a massive impact on the environment, you have to focus on performance and you have to focus on price and you have to focus on scalability, he said. Otherwise, its just a good idea, and thats not good enough. The retail brands are only a small part of Newlights strategy. Replacing virtually all the plastic in the world will involve getting the multinational companies that use it to sign on. Herrema says the company is in talks to partner with other brands. What we hear from brands is: Hey, if theres a solution, we want to adopt it, because they want to get rid of plastics as badly as anybody else, he added.",19/10/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/19/tech/plastic-dissolving-newlight-aircarbon-climate/index.html
"Sharks have killed 7 people in Australia this year, the most since 1934. Climate change could be a factor","One morning in early October, a now-familiar scene unfolded on a beach in Western Australia. A shark had attacked a surfer, who was missing. Authorities sent drones into the sky for aerial surveillance, emergency workers jumped onto boats to scour the area, and medics waited on shore. Days of searching uncovered the mans surfboard, but his body was never found. He was counted as Australias seventh shark attack victim this year  an alarming spike that hasnt been seen in the country for 86 years. This years attacks have taken place in a number of different states, including Queensland and New South Wales. Among them is a diver who also went missing in January after a suspected great white attack. His body was never found. To put this years spike into perspective, there were no shark attack deaths in Australia in 2019. The years before that only saw one or two deaths annually. The last time the country had seven shark attack deaths a year was 1934, according to a spokesperson from the Taronga Conservation Society Australia. The highest annual figure on record dates back to 1929, with nine deaths. In Australia, (this year is) a bit of a blip, said Culum Brown, a professor at Macquarie Universitys Department of Biological Sciences in Sydney. And in fact the long-term average is one  one fatality per year. So seven is a long way above that, theres no doubt. That average of one death per year has stayed stable for the past 50 years, the Taronga spokesperson said. Its not that there has been a sharp increase in shark attacks in Australia overall  there have been 21 shark incidents this year, which is normal and consistent with previous years. The difference is in the fatality rate. There are a number of possible explanations  several experts have pointed out that year-by-year figures always fluctuate, and this could be simple bad luck. But theres another possible culprit: the climate crisis. As oceans heat up, entire ecosystems are being destroyed and forced to adapt. Fish are migrating where theyve never gone before. Species behaviors are changing. And, as the marine world transforms, sharks are following their prey and moving closer to shores popular with humans. On land, Australias climate crisis has led to raging bush fires, extreme heatwaves, and one of the worst droughts on record. But it has also slammed the oceans with acidification and rising temperatures, which can wreak havoc on entire ecosystems. In particular, Australias southeast region is on the front lines of the climate crisis  near-surface waters there are warming at about four times the global average. The Great Barrier Reef, a vital marine ecosystem along the east coast, has experienced such widespread repeated bleaching that more than half the coral on the reef are dead. Massive stretches of mangrove forests have also died in the past decade. Those two ecosystems alone are responsible for a massive diversity in marine ecosystems  so youre seeing huge ecosystems disappearing and/or moving, Brown said. This all means that animals are migrating further south than normal in search of a suitable environment. Species like yellowtail kingfish, which are typically seen in northern tropical waters, are appearing in droves near the southern island state of Tasmania. The common Sydney octopus has shifted from the northeastern state of Queensland down to Tasmania. Even plankton and plant life like kelp are moving south. These types of marine tropical vagrants often travel up and down the coastline, Brown said, riding the Eastern Australian Current famously depicted in the movie Finding Nemo. But now, climate change means winters are warm enough for these fish to survive the season  so some species are choosing to permanently stay in the southern waters. I spend a lot of time in boats off the coast and this year I dont remember a year where Ive seen so many bait fish aggregations so close to the coast, Brown said. Researchers still arent exactly sure what drives the movement of many of these species  but Brown added, theres no doubt the sharks are just responding to where the bait fish are. The ocean is by no means a stagnant mass; the surging currents mean there are areas of warm and cold water. The Eastern Australian Current is a major player in this dynamic  it has also grown much stronger in recent decades, meaning its pumping more warm tropical water down the coast. But because the current is more intense, its also pushing cold nutrient-rich water toward some eastern shores. These dynamic, shifting water temperatures are perhaps also why sharks are beginning to move into human spaces. Some species, like bull sharks, like warm water  so theyre spending more time in the warm southern waters, said Robert Harcourt, a researcher of shark ecology and director of Macquaries marine predator research group. Meanwhile, species like great whites that prefer lower temperatures are drawn closer to shores where pockets of cold water also hold abundant prey. Tiger sharks, too, are typically found further north  but have ventured down as far as Sydney, likely also affected by the current. These three species  bull, great white, and tiger sharks  are responsible for most of Australias shark attack deaths. I would foresee that theres going to be greater movement, an increase in geographic range, in a lot of these species, Harcourt said. Thats because the dynamics of climate change mean their suitable habitat in terms of water temperature and prey distribution is changing as well. And these animals are large, far-ranging apex predators. They will potentially come more in contact with people, and at the same time, human use of the ocean is increasing all the time, he added. Modern technology, improved medical care, and faster emergency response times mean the fatality rate of shark attacks has dropped significantly in the past decade  which is why this years spike is a real anomaly, Harcourt said. But climate change aside, there might also be other factors at play. Luck is a major one: there have been several close calls in recent years where the victim was saved because there happened to be a medical worker close by at that time, said Brown. We managed to save several people over the last couple of years, just by the fortune of having somebody qualified on site to deal with the trauma immediately, and that makes a massive difference, he added. It also depends where the victim is bitten. One centimeter to the left, if you get bitten on the leg, and you can die in seconds or minutes at least, said Harcourt. You know, one centimeter to the right, you get a terrible scar and a lot of pain but if you dont go into shock youve got a good chance of survival. Theres also a chance people are just spending more time in the water this year due to work-from-home conditions during the Covid-19 pandemic, or because its been particularly hot in Australia lately, Harcourt said  thus raising the chances they could run into a shark. Brown and Harcourt cautioned that the 2020 fatality rate of shark attacks is only based on a single years data; given shark figures can fluctuate year by year, its difficult to say whether climate change is directly causing this years spike. It could be a simple matter of bad luck; we just cant know until a few years down the line, when there is enough data to determine if it is a trend or an outlier. But both experts agreed on one thing: the ocean is changing, and sharks are changing with it. Climate change has devastated the worlds natural environments and thrown everything off balance, disrupting how marine ecosystems live, move, and potentially interact with humans. You cant draw any conclusions about anything based on (just one year), but theres no doubt that were moving into a period of the unknown, effectively, Brown said. All the old distributions of species and how we interact with them  you can pretty much throw that out the window.

Key player in war on climate change? The Pentagon,"In the final presidential debate Thursday night, Vice President Joe Biden called climate change an existential threat to humanity that we have a moral obligation to address. Whoever leads the country for the next four years in January has an opportunity to substantially reduce carbon emissions while creating millions of new green tech jobs that could help revive and strengthen the American economy after the Covid-19 crisis. The Department of Defense has a critical role to play in this effort. It also has a strong interest in doing so. Climate change doesnt just imperil coastal military bases with storm surges or delay exercises when heat waves and fires make it impossible to train. Climate change is already causing the armed forces to plan for new contingencies: from being prepared to undertake more frequent disaster relief missions to anticipating instability and conflict created by resource scarcity and population migrations. Whats more, as one of the worlds largest and most complex institutions, the Department of Defense can be part of the climate solution. To its credit, the DoD has already been investing over $1.5 billion of its annual research and development budget in new energy technologies. In the past, it has played a significant role in developing nuclear reactors, gas turbines and solar photovoltaic cells. In the future, the DoD could help accelerate the development of dual-use green technologies, from cleaner jet fuels, which alone account for more than 50% of DoDs energy consumption, to compact nuclear fusion, fuel cells, better batteries, microgrids and storage technologies. These innovations could transform operational energy for the military while also spinning out civilian applications, much as the DoDs original investments in GPS and the internet stimulated whole new sectors of the US economy. The other obvious opportunity stems from the agencys massive carbon footprint. The Defense Department is responsible for transporting, housing and training hundreds of thousands of servicemembers and their families around the globe; powering and heating more than half a million buildings; and maintaining over 27 million acres of land. The US military is the nations single largest consumer of energy and the worlds single largest consumer of petroleum. While the DoD will never be able to eliminate its environmental impact completely, there are many steps it can take to reduce its carbon emissions without sacrificing readiness or operations. As an enterprise, the DoD operates thousands of cars, SUVs, vans and shuttle buses from its facilities across the country. Gradually replacing older vehicles with new hybrid or electric vehicles would not only be more fuel efficient, it would also grow the market for a nascent US industry. Similarly, retrofitting military facilities with green materials and technologies would make buildings more energy efficient, while also growing high-paying manufacturing and construction jobs. Scaling investments in alternative energy like solar would lessen demand on local energy grids and help drive down the cost of renewable energy nationwide. By leveraging its procurement power to create large-scale demand, the DoD can accelerate market growth, helping green technologies become more viable and affordable for widespread use while enhancing American competitiveness. Greening the DoD enterprise isnt just good for the environment and the economy  as many other large enterprises have learned, energy efficiency ultimately saves money and benefits local communities. If, for example, DoD were to require all of the contractors providing military housing to meet certain energy efficiency standards, it would reduce the energy bills and improve the quality of life for military families across the country. Similarly, if all new construction on military installations had to meet high Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) standards, the long-term energy and maintenance cost savings would more than pay for the marginally higher construction costs. While I am optimistic about the militarys role in addressing climate change, I am also realistic. Military leaders from base commanders to the Joint Chiefs might rightly ask if spending money on climate-friendly initiatives takes away funds from other pressing operational needs. It need not  if Congress steps up to make addressing climate change a national security priority. Congress should work with the Pentagon to set a strategic goal for reaching DoD carbon neutrality and commission a study to determine the actions and funding necessary to get there. In the meantime, Congress should experiment with some pilot programs, such as making additional funding available to those base commanders willing to retrofit facilities to meet high LEED standards. Congress should also authorize the creation of a new DoD office for energy innovation to advance the adoption of green technologies that would support DoDs goal of carbon neutrality. Former Vice president and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has already stated that, if elected, he intends to address climate change, invest in sustainable infrastructure and enhance our competitiveness simultaneously by building back better. The Pentagon  in need of cheaper and more reliable energy, more efficient vehicles, more resilient facilities, and updated infrastructure  can do the same. Over the long run, a greener Defense Department wont just be more cost-effective  it will play an important role in addressing the climate crisis while also advancing US economic competitiveness as a leader in green technologies. The next president and Congress should enlist the Pentagon as a force for good in advancing this critical national security objective.",26/10/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/26/opinions/climate-change-pentagon-flournoy/index.html
The US election is a vote on climate change for the whole world,"The climate crisis has become a key issue not just for American voters in this US election  but people across the world. What the next president does or doesnt do over the next four years will have a profound impact on the whether the world is able to avert the worst effects of climate change, scientists, policy makers and activists say. They say the world needs a US president who cares about climate change, for two main reasons. First, many nations take their cue from US policy, particularly on issues such as the climate crisis, meaning Washington has a unique opportunity to influence. Second, the US is the worlds second-biggest polluter after China, meaning it has a moral obligation to act. President Donald Trump, during his current administration, has gutted domestic environmental regulations and policies designed to limit global warming. Internationally, he has pulled the US out of the landmark Paris climate accord, the only global pact that seeks to avoid dangerous heating of the planet. And hes doubted the reasons for climate change. During the final presidential debate on Friday, Trump falsely claimed said the US has the cleanest air and the cleanest water, and called India and China filthy, a skewered rendition of reality. His Democratic challenger former Vice President Joe Biden, said at the same debate that global warming is an existential threat to humanity. We have a moral obligation to deal with it. Bidens comments echo what the scientists are saying. Global carbon dioxide concentrations  the main culprit warming the planet  are at higher levels than at any time in human history. Its too late to stop all the impacts of climate change. They are already happening. Wildfires have torched homes across the Western US this year, unprecedented floods have inundated large swathes of Asia, and the past decade   featuring deadly heatwaves and droughts  was the hottest ever recorded. The ice caps that bookend our planet are also seeing rapid loss and glacial melt. Under a US president who pushes for climate policies, however, the world could work toward marginal, incremental damages rather than catastrophic ones, said Jonathan Pershing, program director of environment at the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, who was the former special envoy for climate change at the US Department of State during the second term of the Obama administration. Pershing added: Every succeeding election becomes more and more urgent because the time is shorter to manage those really grievous damages. The coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 230,000 and infected 9.1 million people in the US, has exposed that Trumps administration is hostile to science and decades of research. That endangers lives and livelihoods, according to Kim Cobb, a professor and researcher of paleoclimate and climate change at Georgia Tech. Its not really the planet anymore. Its really about people. And thats something that we all have to wake up to. Its not about saving polar bears and coral reefs, its about us, Cobb said. We can simply not afford to put our heads in the sand about this other lasting global challenge which is a direct threat to our country. The Paris Agreement, a pact signed into effect in 2016 by almost all the worlds countries, seeks to limit global warming to well below 2C and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5C. To do so, countries need to reach net zero emissions by 2050. When Trump announced in June 2017 that the US would be withdrawing from the agreement, it signaled that America would no longer lead the global fight against climate change. Studies have shown the so-called Trump Effect has made it easier for other countries to renege on their climate commitments. Its critically important for the entire movement that the US be a part of it, said Lois Young, Belizes ambassador to the United Nations. Other countries that are big emitters are saying, Well if the United States is not accountable, why should I be? At UN climate talks in Madrid last year, Young, who is also head of the Alliance of Small Island States, accused big polluters like the US of ecocide. She said the Trump administrations policies on climate have been a total disaster. They have closed their eyes to the science, she said, adding that fossil fuel emissions pollute and impact the whole world. Emissions dont have borders. We are all in this together, as we are with Covid. So what happens in America doesnt stay in America. We all pay a price. Over the past three-and-a-half years, the Trump administration has rolled back fuel efficiency standards, loosened restrictions on methane emissions, approved the largest reduction in the boundaries of protected land in US history, and made changes to Clean Water Act and Endangered Species Act protections. In fact, researchers at Columbia University in New York have tracked 100 environmental rules that have been or are being reversed. Trumps staunch backing of the fossil fuel industry has earned him nearly $13 million in campaign donations from individuals at oil and gas firms, according to OpenSecrets, a research group that tracks money in politics. The industry has sent $976,000 to Biden. But Trumps mission to revive Americas coal industry is failing, as coal keeps losing ground to cleaner and cheaper alternatives. Biden, meanwhile, has laid out a $1.7 trillion climate plan focused on clean energy, green jobs and with a goal of carbon free electricity by 2035 and net-zero emissions by 2050. Biden would also re-enter the Paris climate accord and has promised to stand up to polluters by banning new oil and gas drilling on federal lands and requiring methane emission limits for new operations. If Trump wins again, the chances of achieving anything like Paris compliance are very, very low. Thats the level we are at already, said Tim Benton, who leads the Energy, Environment and Resources groups and the British think tank Chatham House. If Biden wins, there is much more space for ambitious climate action on a global basis, he said, but warned its so late in the day for action to reduce the required emissions that we still might not get to Paris levels. In recent years, young people have been increasingly vocal about the climate crisis, demanding the issue remains on the international agenda. The future of all youth is at stake here, and there is no turning back if we pass the point of no return when it comes to our climate, said Sohanur Rahman, a leading Bangladeshi youth activist and founding member of YouthNet for Climate Justice. History will remember the course the next administration takes. In May, Super Cyclone Amphan struck Bangladesh and devastated the entire southwest coastal region, affecting 10 million people and costing an estimated $13 billion in damage. Flooding in recent years has swamped a third of the country, with neighboring India heavily impacted, too. Every fossil fuel infrastructure that the United States builds affects me and my people, as well as those from vulnerable countries around the world, said Rahman. He said the US needs to use its influence and wealth to offer support to Bangladesh and other global south countries through technology transfer, renewable energy subsidies, and finance for climate mitigation. A continent away, young activists in Africa also say the US domestic policy on climate change has profound impacts on them, because the African continent and the Global South are facing some of the worst climate effects. US policy decisions, their ideological impact has been felt especially hard since the introduction of the Trump administration. Through their withdrawing from the Paris Agreement in June of 2017 and their continued investment in and support for climate change denial, wrote Nick Ford, 17, and Petra de Beer, 16, in a joint email statement. They are activists with the Cape Town-based African Climate Alliance, a youth-led environmental and social justice group. They say its vital the next administration is strongly cognizant of their global impact and recognizes its obligations which take place through both the policy decisions of those in power within the US, and in the information which the US chooses to disseminate or suppress. Exceptional drought followed by extremely heavy rainfall markedly decreased the seasonal crop yield in the Horn of Africa during 2019. These irregular weather and climate patterns also contributed to the worst desert locust invasion in 25 years, which further threatened the crop supply in the region. Across Asia Pacific, the climate crisis has also affected people, ecosystems and livelihoods. Storm surges in the Philippines have become harder to predict and more intense, the Mekong River in Southeast Asia  a lifeline for 60 million people  is at its lowest level in 100 years, and rising sea levels are threatening megacities, such as Dhaka, Shanghai, and Jakarta or entire Pacific Islands. Chuck Baclagon, finance campaigner for environmental group 350 Asia, said the US pulling out of the Paris Agreement was an injustice for many Asian countries who are least responsible and have least benefited from the massive burning of fossil fuels in the past 150 years. A landmark 2018 report from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said the world has only until 2030 to reduce emissions enough to limit warming to 1.5C and avoid the most disastrous climate impacts. Global solidarity, Baclagon said, is more important than ever. With less than a decade to tackle the climate crisis, the United States involvement in climate action is extremely important. According to Baclagon, America could use its influence to lean on private financial institutions  including banks, insurance companies, and pension funds  that continue to invest in fossil fuels. The onus is not solely on the United States  as several of the largest financial institutions are based in Asia. But if the new US administration will make clear that climate is back on top of their agenda, financial institutions worldwide will take notice, he said. Young said the world wont succeed in reducing the necessary emissions, or adapting to the climate onslaught without America. On a scale of 1-10 without the US, we would be at a 6 in success. We need the US to take us over the finish line to 10, she said. You hate to say you are beholden or that you need one country but the fact of the matter is, we need the US. Thats because the US has the science, the technology, and the finance to move forward and their influence is critical, Young said. Other big polluters, such as the European Union and China have already signaled they will step up. At the UN general assembly last month, Chinese President Xi Jinping announced that China would become carbon neutral by 2060. When it comes to climate leadership over the last four years, Europe in effect has stepped into the gap left by the United States, particularly working with China and low income countries, said Chatham Houses Benton. They have made some progress, but that is much less than would have been the case if you had a US-EU-China strong coalition. As part of the Paris Agreement, wealthy countries also pledged to mobilize $100 billion a year in climate funding for developing countries  something Trump said the US would not do under his administration. And thats where the biggest threat lies, because the US would be one of the major contributors to these funds, and that makes it much harder for the European Union to just stand in and say we can cover the American contribution ... that would be really difficult to pull off, said Robert Falkner, the Research Director of the LSEs Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment. For some nations, like Australia, the outcome of the US election could determine in which direction they move on their own climate policy. What Washington says and wants reverberates very closely in Canberra, said Frank Jotzo, director of the Centre for Climate and Energy Policy at Australian National University. If Trump has a second term then we will see a hardening of Australias position not to do much, not to take on a stronger targets, not to declare a net zero target for middle of the century, Jotzo said. A Biden presidency, he said, would put pressure for positive climate change policy on all its allies. Australia has seen extreme droughts and water shortages provide the fuel for a devastating bushfire season last year. For Australia it is really quite fundamental, its a question about the viability of our cities and agriculture, Jotzo said. The US being part of the Paris Agreement doesnt ensure the world will avoid dangerous climate change. Many countries that have signed up are behind on their climate goals, few have updated their commitments in 2020, and many big polluters such as the EU need to set more ambitious goals if they want to comply with the accord, according to Climate Action Tracker. Indeed, if governments stick to their current targets submitted under the Paris Agreement, the world is set to warm by 2.7C by the end of the century, according to CAT, bringing more extreme storms, heatwaves, greater sea level rise, and, for many parts of the world, worse droughts and rainfall extremes. Jotzo said what is likely to make the biggest difference is investment and innovations in clean energy from the private sector. The price of renewable forms of energy, such as solar power, are now cheaper than the price of coal, and electric vehicles are becoming more affordable. Innovations in green tech are finding other ways to deal with other planet-warming gases like methane and refrigerants, and there has been innovation around zero-carbon steel. The long term trajectory is clearly towards very substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, Jotzo said. Zero emission technologies are now cost competitive with polluting technologies and this creates an incentive for many corporates in many countries to actually push in that direction. Trump may be seen as being pro-business but backing the fossil fuel industry has not created the jobs he promised. There is now an increasing awareness that the choice for policy makers, politicians and businesses is not between solving climate change or having a strong economy. You can have both. Keeping fossil fuels in the ground, reducing emissions and stopping subsidies for coal and oil, as well as ramping up use of renewables is vital for limiting climate disasters and avoiding economic impacts worse than the coronavirus pandemic has wrought, Young said. To achieve this, the US needs to be accountable, according to Young: Covid will be overcome, the climate crisis cannot be overcome unless we have American leadership.",02/11/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/11/01/world/us-election-climate-crisis-intl-dst-hnk/index.html
"America, we?e missed you. Now please get your act together on climate change","Joe Bidens victory in the US presidential election makes us hopeful for our collective future on Earth. We are confident that under his leadership public trust in facts, in science, and in international collaboration to solve global problems will be restored. In doing so, the President-elect will bring a short but aberrant period of US history to a close. Nevertheless, Biden has his work cut out. He is inheriting multiple crises, and with so many competing priorities he must ensure that climate change remains at the top of the pile. Restoring environmental standards and safeguards and rejoining the Paris Climate Accord  that sees almost every other country in the world working together to help humanity avert disaster  are essential, but they wont be enough. Our global climate emergency has intensified over the past four years. We now have less than a decade to stop irreversible climate change. To do so, we must cut our greenhouse gas emissions by half by 2030 and net zero by 2050. Time is running out. So are our options. The Trump administrations dismissal of climate change has cost America dearly at home and abroad. Outside the US, President Donald Trumps decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement has encouraged other nations to ignore their own climate pledges. The Amazon is burning. Illegal logging has accelerated in Indonesia, according to conservation-news site Mongabay. Russia is mulling oil exploration in the Arctic. Over the past three years, climate-related disasters have cost the world $650 billion, according to Morgan Stanley. Domestically, Trumps decision to silence climate scientists and gut environmental protection agencies has left the country ill-equipped to deal with the destruction wrought by climate change. That is why it is imperative that President-elect Biden makes reversing this a priority from day one. This is not just because the costs of ignoring climate change are becoming an intolerable burden on all the Americans who lose their homes and livelihoods to hurricanes, floods and wildfires. As Bidens clean energy and environmental justice plan makes clear, acting on climate change could be the biggest economic and employment opportunity in history. Many of the strategies used to accomplish this will also simultaneously help tackle other pressing crises. If the ongoing pandemic has taught us anything, it is that the health of humans, the economy and our planet are deeply intertwined. If we continue to slash and burn our forests, for example, deadly pathogens will continue to jump species and humans will remain vulnerable to future pandemics. Our overlapping health, economic and environmental crises are connected. They demand connected solutions. Bidens plan is ambitious, but we urge him to go further. On the campaign trail, the Democratic candidate was equivocal about the future of fossil fuels. We urge him to end subsidies to the fossil fuel industry once and for all. According to an International Monetary Fund (IMF) study, the US spent $649 billion in fossil fuel subsidies in 2015 alone  more than the countrys defense budget and more than seven times the federal spending on education in that year. The US remains, along with China and Russia, one of the worlds top three subsidizers of dirty fuels, the IMF report noted. To remain so would make a nonsense of the President-elects own climate plan. Some of those billions would be better spent on education and scientific research  so savagely neglected and sabotaged by President Trump. Innovation is an essential part of dealing with climate change. We will need a barrage of innovations to strengthen our food security, to improve how steel and cement are made, and to feed the hungry without destroying more of our natural habitats. Data is a resource, like seeds, water or money, and it can be used to help farmers make better decisions, such as when to sow crops. Timely health data can detect outbreaks of infectious diseases and stop their spread. But at present, the world dedicates as little as 4% of global research and development spending on green innovation, according to The Economist  more than $80 billion a year, or just twice the amount tech firm Amazon spends on R&D. Lastly, we would urge President-elect Biden to invest in adapting to climate change as well as curbing it because millions of Americans are already living with the effects of global warming. Miami may be fighting for survival in the face of rising sea levels while Manhattan needs to be better prepared for the next Superstorm Sandy. Under President Trump, America lost precious time in the race to limit climate change. The President-elect represents a fresh start. Investing in science, innovation and adaptation, and re-engaging with the international community on climate action, will rebuild a better nation. And hopefully a better world, too.",13/11/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/11/13/opinions/america-weve-missed-you-ban-ki-moon-patrick-verkooijen/index.html
Can Biden? green agenda break the ?rown blockade?,"President-elect Joe Biden has committed more explicitly than any nominee before him to dramatic steps against the climate crisis, but he faces the same geographic puzzle that has precluded congressional action on the challenge for years. Although Biden won the popular vote by a margin well over 5 million and expanded the Democrats Electoral College map, he still confronted an impregnable wall of opposition from the states most tightly integrated into the fossil fuel economy, a CNN analysis of the results has found. Biden dominated the largely post-industrial states, many of them along the two coasts, that generate the least amount of carbon emissions per dollar of economic activity, according to figures from the federal Energy Information Administration. But as in 2016, President Donald Trump won almost all of the states that emit the most carbon per dollar of economic output, a measure that tracks which states rely most on fossil fuels, either as producers or consumers. Equally important, those states overwhelmingly sent to the Senate Republicans who almost indivisibly oppose federal action to reduce the carbon emissions linked to global climate change. After ousting one Democratic incumbent (Doug Jones in Alabama) and fending off well-funded challenges in several other states (including Montana, Iowa, South Carolina, Texas and Alaska), Republicans now hold 37 of the 42 Senate seats in the 21 states that emit the most carbon per dollar of economic output. Democrats, in turn, after beating Republican Sen. Cory Gardner in Colorado, hold at least 36 of the Senate seats in the 21 states with the least carbon-intensive economies, with two seats in Georgia yet to be decided in January runoffs. The eight states clustered around the national average for carbon emissions per dollar of gross domestic product split narrowly, with Republicans holding nine of their Senate seats and Democrats seven. The GOPs dominant position in the high-carbon states means that Republicans, even if they lose control of the Senate in the Georgia runoffs, can sustain a filibuster against climate action almost solely with senators from the states most invested in the existing fossil fuel economy  a dynamic that Ive called the brown blockade. This increasing alignment of red and blue with brown and green ensures an explosive collision as Biden takes office determined to reverse Trumps dismissive approach to the climate crisis. I have no doubt that he [Biden] feels like he has a mandate to take climate action and his team does, says Christy Goldfuss, senior vice president for energy and environmental policy at the liberal Center for American Progress, who was a top environmental official under President Barack Obama. He is coming out of the gate addressing the issue on day one. Even in the shadow of a once-in-a-century pandemic and the associating economic upheaval, Biden discussed climate change more than any previous nominee and certainly committed to the most ambitious plan of any President-elect to confront it. At the second presidential debate, Biden forthrightly acknowledged, I would transition from the oil industry, as part of the long-term evolution to a carbon-free economy. Under intense fire from Trump and other Republicans, Biden clarified that statement to indicate that he was talking about a long-term change that would unfold over decades  and that he would not ban fracking for natural gas on private land in the meantime. But he did not renounce his commitments to the transition itself. And to experts that marks a new era in the long-stalemated debate over climate. We are far closer to taking climate change seriously, because for the first time one of our major political parties ... now sees climate change as one of the absolute top issues, says Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. That simply was not the case 12 months ago. Period, bold, underlined, exclamation point. That will have consequences. In particular, Biden will take the debate into a new stage by requiring virtually every agency in the federal government to factor it into its plans. Goldfuss, the managing director of the Council on Encvironmental Quality for Obama, recently helped lead the production of a report that underscored the opportunity for Biden to advance the transition to a low-carbon society across a wide spectrum of agencies. President-elect Biden will be the first president that pursues a whole of government approach to climate change from day one, she says. What we outlined in Climate 21 was a strategy where you organize your agenda on climate change out of the White House ... and really make sure you are driving progress across your entire government. That is a very large body of work and there are a ton of tools at your disposal. Robert McNally, who was a White House energy aide to President George W. Bush and now advises energy companies, uses the analogy of the unexpectedly successful offensive from the Viet Cong during the Vietnam War in 1968 to measure how aggressively he expects the new administration to reverse Trumps hands-off approach on climate. Biden using executive powers can unleash a Tet offensive onslaught against the oil and gas industry, and he will, McNally predicts. But for all of the opportunities available to Biden, experts note he faces two large obstacles. One is that many of his most ambitious proposals  particularly to drastically increase spending on clean energy alternatives  will require congressional action. And there he faces the same intractable geographic divide that has shelved any serious discussion of climate issues, particularly in the Senate. Just as in the 2016 election, the states most invested in the fossil fuel economy predominantly sided with Republicans. Trump carried 10 of the 15 states that produce the most coal, 11 of the 15 that produce the most natural gas and 12 of the 15 that produce the most oil, according to EIA figures. The EIAs analysis of carbon emissions per dollar of economic activity offers the broadest measure of states integration into the fossil fuel economy. The states at the top of that list tend to be large fossil fuel producers (such as Wyoming, West Virginia, Alaska and Texas) or to have robust agricultural and/or manufacturing sectors that are large consumers of those fuels (such as Iowa, Nebraska, Ohio and Indiana). The ones at the bottom are mostly coastal states that produce little oil, gas or coal and have transitioned more rapidly into the post-industrial economy of services and high-tech jobs, such as Massachusetts, New York, Virginia, Washington, Oregon and California (which does produce some natural gas). Trump won 20 of the 21 states that emit the most carbon per dollar of economic output, with New Mexico the sole exception. Biden won 19 of the 21 with the least emissions, with only Florida and North Carolina (narrowly) defying the trend. Biden made significant gains in the middle tier of eight states clustered around the national average for emissions per dollar of GDP, carrying five of them, including four that Trump won last time: Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Arizona. The Senate results, as noted above, largely follow these tracks, too. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania is one of the relatively few Senate Democrats (along with colleagues from West Virginia, Montana and Colorado) representing a state with a substantial energy sector (Pennsylvania ranks second in natural gas production, with a large fracking industry around Pittsburgh). In an interview, Casey said he was confident that he could sustain support for Bidens climate and energy agenda in the state, which the former vice president narrowly recaptured after Trump narrowly won it in 2016. I am comfortable with his approach and I think its where most of the country is and frankly where most of the state is, Casey told me. Especially valuable, Casey said, is that Biden has framed the response to climate change as an economic as much as an environmental imperative and has accepted an extended transition from fossil fuels  when you have a state like ours where gas extraction is such a prominent part of the economy that people can hold two concepts in their minds at the same time: One that we have to address climate change directly and have a sense of urgency about it, but also that we can have responsible gas extraction. Gina McCarthy, the director of the Environmental Protection Agency under Obama and now president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, also says Bidens emphasis on the potential economic benefits of responding to climate change could help broaden the coalition for action. I think you are going to see Joe Biden move the climate agenda forward by not necessarily hitting people over the head with climate change, she told me. I think hes looking at these as investment opportunities, not punishments, not sacrifices. ... I think theres an opportunity here to talk in a way the American public will understand and not to divorce it from our need to keep people working and grow more jobs. Bidens discipline in linking climate action with economic opportunity  reiterated in his speech Monday on the economy  is likely to help him align the relatively few Senate Democrats from energy-producing areas behind his plans. His problem is that theres no sign of cracks in the wall against climate action from the much larger number of Senate Republicans representing energy-producing areas. Bidens leverage to pressure those Republicans may be extremely limited because all of them represent states that backed Trump in the election. One energy lobbyist and former Trump administration official, who asked for anonymity to discuss internal conversations, says most Republicans from energy-producing states see the Biden climate agenda as an existential threat to their local economies. Thats why the fault lines are going to remain where they are, if not harden, the lobbyist said. I dont see why any Republican would want to go along with a big climate bill whose purpose is to put their home state or their constituents out of business. Plus, the lobbyist noted, after the success Republicans had tarring Democrats in energy-producing areas with the proposed Green New Deal, if the GOP maintains Senate control Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is unlikely to favor a climate bill that would allow Democrats to claim credit for a moderate bipartisan compromise. To many observers, the difficult Senate math facing Democrats  largely because of their inability to dent the brown blockade in the election  means that Biden is likely to lean heavily on regulatory action. McCarthy sees great opportunities to not only revive but also expand the two key Obama regulatory initiatives on climate that Trump has rescinded: the deal Obama reached with auto companies to significantly improve fuel efficiency, and his Clean Power Plan to reduce emissions from electrical power generation. McCarthy said a revised fuel economy standard could require the sale of only electric or other zero-emission cars by 2035 or 2040, and that an updated clean power plan, supported by complementary federal spending, could point the nation toward Bidens 2035 goal of zero-emission electricity generation. States and utilities, she says, already are recognizing that is the path to cheaper electricity and a healthier community and so that in combination with the budget can actually advance this [transition]. But Biden faces a formidable obstacle in centering his climate agenda on regulation: the joint success of Trump and McConnell at confirming more than 200 federal judges, including three justices who have cemented a solid 6-3 Republican advantage on the Supreme Court. That Republican court majority has signaled it may not only resist new extensions of federal regulatory power but also also seek to roll back existing authority long upheld under a legal precedent known as the Chevron doctrine. Many observers believe this Supreme Court may even seek to retrench the landmark 5-4 decision in 2007 that upheld the EPAs authority to regulate carbon emissions under the Clean Air Act. That new 6-3 Supreme Court is going to require Biden to play defense on foundational environmental law, says McNally. The Supreme Court might be even more ambitious in overturning environmental initiatives, some believe, if Republicans hold the Senate and effectively reassure the justices that Democrats could not enlarge the court in response to aggressive rulings. Two long-term changes may soften the resistance to climate action in some of the big fossil fuel states. One is that they are facing more consequences from the changing climate  from hurricanes in the Southeast to wildfires in the West (though polling still shows most Republicans in those states do not attribute them to human-induced climate change). The other is that renewable energy production is growing as an economic force in many of those same places, with Texas, Oklahoma, Iowa and Kansas leading in wind production and solar output growing in highly contested purple states including Nevada, Arizona and North Carolina. Today, the fossil fuel industry holds ... a stranglehold over the Republican Party particularly in those [high-carbon] states, but that is going to change, says Leiserowitz. Many of the same states that are fossil fuel-producing states are also blessed with the most wind and solar and geothermal resources. The question for Biden is whether those economic and political dynamics will change fast enough to loosen the Senates brown blockade against climate action. The question for the country, and the world, may be: What are the consequences if it does not?",17/11/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/11/17/politics/biden-climate-change-agenda-senate/index.html
Jeff Bezos announces nearly $800 million in grants to 16 groups fighting climate change,"Amazon founder Jeff Bezos announced Monday that he will give $791 million in grants as part of his Bezos Earth Fund to 16 organizations that are working to protect the environment. The fund is part of the CEOs $10 billion pledge to support scientists, activists, NGOs and organizations working to protect the environment. Ive spent the past several months learning from a group of incredibly smart people whove made it their lifes work to fight climate change and its impact on communities around the world, Bezos wrote in an Instagram post on Monday announcing the news. Im inspired by what theyre doing, and excited to help them scale. The full list of grantees are a mix of big name NGOs, labs, reforestation and climate justice groups. They include: The Climate and Clean Energy Equity Fund, ClimateWorks Foundation, Dream Corps Green For All, Eden Reforestation Projects, Energy Foundation, Environmental Defense Fund, The Hive Fund for Climate and Gender Justice, Natural Resources Defense Council, The Nature Conservancy, NDN Collective, Rocky Mountain Institute, Salk Institute for Biological Studies, The Solutions Project, Union of Concerned Scientists, World Resources Institute and World Wildlife Fund. The news comes one year after Amazon announced The Climate Pledge, which is the companys commitment to be 100% powered by renewable energy by 2025 and be net zero carbon by 2040. Amazon has also purchased 100,000 electric delivery vehicles and invested $100 million into reforestation projects and climate mitigation solutions. We can all protect Earths future by taking bold action now, Bezos wrote in his post on Monday. Bezoss $10 billion pledge is a fraction of his personal net worth, which the Bloomberg Billionaires Index estimates is currently $184 billion. And Amazon has been criticized for the environmental impact of its emphasis on faster and faster shipping, as CNN reported in 2019. Bezos has been under pressure from his employees to do more to protect the environment. Thousands of Amazon employees signed a letter in May of 2019 asking how the company planned to respond to climate change, and many of them staged a walkout in September of 2019 calling on it to do more. A day before the walkout, Amazon announced a pledge to go carbon neutral by 2040, ten years before the deadline set out by the Paris climate agreement. The company also said it will deploy 100,000 electric delivery vans by 2024. In February, when Bezos announced the $10 billion pledge, Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, the group that staged last years walkout, responded by saying more needs to be done to address underlying causes like fossil fuel consumption. Will Jeff Bezos show us true leadership, they said in a statement at the time, or will he continue to be complicit in the acceleration of the climate crisis, while supposedly trying to help?",17/11/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/11/16/business/amazon-jeff-bezos-earth-fund-scn-trnd/index.html
Covid-19 and climate change make hurricanes more devastating for Latin America,"When it rained, people used to see it as a good omen. Now in Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala, they see the drops falling from the sky with terror. After two Category 4 hurricanes this month, communities in these Central American countries have witnessed rivers overflowing from torrential rains, crops destroyed, cattle washed away, schools flooded, and roads engulfed in landslides. Death, disease and poverty will likely follow. While poor people in rural areas have been often worst-hit by the succession of Hurricane Eta and Hurricane Iota, the repercussions from those storms are already being felt in the halls of power. In Guatemala City this weekend, anger boiled up into the streets as protesters set fire to the Congress building, forcing legislators to reverse budget cuts to the countrys already crippled health care and education systems. Exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic, the fallout from these climate disasters will continue to spread. And it may eventually even reach distant countries, as Central Americans left desperate and vulnerable by the storms flee abroad. Three million people have been affected by Eta and Iota, the Red Cross estimates, and hundreds of thousands of people have been evacuated and displaced. Dozens are dead and missing. Add Covid-19 to the strains on crowded evacuation shelters, and its a recipe for another perfect storm. The risk of Covid-19 spreading will only increase as more seek refuge in shelters, already crowded with more than 17,500 Guatemalans from the last storm, Miriam Aguilar, Guatemala representative for humanitarian aid organization, Mercy Corps, said last week. From Honduras, Dr. Maria Angelica Milla, who specializes in nutrition, had her colleague show CNN a makeshift evacuation shelter in an elementary school in San Pedro Sula, where people could be seen wearing no masks and keeping no safe distance. Cardboard boxes lay spread out on the floormakeshift mattresses for so many families who lost everything. About 180 displaced people have taken shelter there, Milla added, and the coronavirus is often the least of their concerns. Hunger looms, she said. Kids who depended on a meal at school arent even getting that, since schools have been closed due to the pandemic and even more so now with the hurricanes, she said. Basic necessities, like shelter and clean drinking water, are the most pressing needs for many, UNICEFs representative in Honduras, Mark Connolly also told CNN. Mirza Yolany Valdez, a full-time mother, lost everything during Hurricane Eta. She has been at the elementary school with her two sons, aged 3 and 11, in San Pedro Sula ever since. Im just praying that God gives me strength because its super sad to go home and have nothing, she told CNN in a video call. Her voice cracked, and she began to cry. With the first hurricane I couldnt rescue anything and now with the second, even less. Violence, insecurity, poverty and lack of opportunities have long been motivators for people to migrate north where they hope to find a better chance at life. For months, experts have predicted that Covid-19 could create a new wave of migrants trying to reach the US border. But the lasting damage of Hurricanes Eta and Iota are a reminder that climate change is a growing driver of migration, too. People dont know where to go now, says Leonardo Pineda, Director of a local Honduran NGO, Asociacion Juventud Siglo Veintiuno (JUSIVE) in San Pedro Sula. He tells CNN hes been hearing a lot of young people talk about migrating. There is no work, so in what will people work? They look precisely for something to help them grow and in Honduras this is difficult, Pineda said. During the interview, a torrential downpour could be seen and heard in the background  the rains that make recovery efforts even more difficult. Steve McAndrew, Red Cross deputy regional director for the Americas, described the scope and breadth of the hurricane damage as really overwhelming to CNN. We know from history, we know from Hurricane Mitch and other major disasters like this that it only increases peoples desperation to seek out better opportunities elsewhere, he said, referring to the 1998 storm so deadly it became the basis for special US immigration status for Hondurans and Nicaraguans. This can definitely increase all those pressures for people to move. In a meeting last week, Guatemalan president Alejandro Giammattei and Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernandez called on the worlds wealthiest nations directly contributing to climate change to help their countries recover from the hurricanes with financial assistance. This in turn would help mitigate a large migration flow north, Giammattei said. Every time there is a natural disaster as a result of climate change, we acquire debt, Giammattei added. This has brought on a vicious cycle where we get in debt, we reconstruct, it gets destroyed, we get into debt, we re-build and it get destroyed again. Central America and Honduras are among the regions in the world most affected by climate change, Honduran president Hernandez said. Dr. Milla has no doubt that the storms will launch new waves of migration  the only option for some to survive apocalyptic devastation on the ground, she says. Famine is coming, she told CNN. So much famine is coming because the last harvest was lost, there is no capacity to store anything, prices were already skyrocketing. I dont want to think about whats going on through the minds of those who lost everything, Milla added. Prepare for the waves.",24/11/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/11/24/americas/covid-19-climate-hurricanes-central-america-intl/index.html
Trees are losing their leaves earlier because of climate change,"Trees will start to shed their leaves earlier as the planet warms, a new study has suggested, contradicting previous assumptions that warming temperatures are delaying the onset of fall. Every year, in a process known as senescence, the leaves of deciduous trees turn yellow, orange and red as they suspend growth and extract nutrients from foliage, before falling from the tree ahead of winter. Leaf senescence also marks the end of the period during which plants absorb carbon dioxide through photosynthesis. Global warming has resulted in longer growing seasons  spring leaves are emerging in European trees about two weeks earlier, compared with 100 years ago, researchers said. Previous models assumed that because autumns will get warmer and warmer over the coming century, autumn will get delayed  growing seasons will overall get longer, and autumn will get delayed by two to three weeks, ecosystem ecologist Constantin Zohner said. However, Zohner and a team of researchers have said their findings reverse this prediction. We actually predict by the end of the century, leaves might even fall off three to six days earlier, Zohner, a corresponding author on the paper published Friday in the journal Science, added. Using a combination of field observations, laboratory tests and modeling, experts studied data that tracked six European deciduous tree species  European horse chestnut, silver birch, European beech, European larch, English oak and rowan  over the last six decades. Increases in spring and summer productivity that come as a result of elevated carbon dioxide, temperature and light levels actually drive trees to lose their leaves earlier, the experts found. It had been assumed, Zohner said, that fall temperatures and day length were the main environmental factors that cause trees to lose their leaves. Now, researchers have identified a third factor  a self-constraining productivity. What we now see is there is this third huge mechanism that is going on  the (tree) productivity is self constraining itself. If you have more going on already in spring and summer  if the plant absorbs more CO2 in synthesis through spring and summer, they lose their leaves earlier, he said. This is a mechanism we also see in humans  if you start eating earlier, you will be full earlier, he said. The findings, Zohner said, have shown that trees have productivity constraints. We cannot just put more and more CO2 in the atmosphere and (expect) trees will just do so much more  there are limits, he said.",27/11/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/11/27/europe/fall-leaves-intl-scli-climate-scn/index.html
"We?e at a turning point on climate change. But most countries are still choosing fossil fuels over clean energy, report says","Governments of the world are at a critical juncture for shaping the climates future but are on course to produce too many fossil fuels in the decade ahead, a new report has found. To limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit)  which scientists say would avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate change  countries need to wind down their fossil fuel production by 6% every year between now and 2030, according to the 2020 Production Gap report. Instead, countries are on track to produce an increase of 2% per year. And as governments pour money into their economies in a bid to recover from the coronavirus pandemic, they risk locking the world into a climate disaster by investing more heavily in fossil fuel industries  such as power, aviation, and car manufacturing, according to the new analysis from the Stockholm Environment Institute, International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), Overseas Development Institute (ODI), E3G and the UN Environment Programme. We find ourselves at a critical juncture at this time. While global fossil fuel production will dip sharply this year, government action and recovery measures are poised to shape our climate future, said Ploy Pattanun Achakulwisut, SEI scientist and co-author of the report. They could either return to pre-Covid production levels that lock-in severe climate disruption, or they could set the stage for a managed wind down of fossil fuel production. The first Production Gap report last year found that governments are expected to produce 120% more fossil fuels by 2030 than what scientists say is permissible to keep the planet from warming 1.5C (2.7F) and 50% more than what we can burn to keep warming to 2C (3.6F). Those figures remain the same this year. The report examines whether plans for future fossil fuel production are in line with global pledges to reduce the release of heat-trapping gases. The findings suggest the actions of many countries dont match their words. While some say they plan to decrease their emissions, many are still investing in new fossil fuel projects. This year, several major polluting countries pledged to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, including the United States, Japan and South Korea, with China pledging to go carbon neutral by 2060. But there is a long road to achieve that. The report found that from now until 2030, the global production of coal would have to decline annually by 11%, along with a 4% yearly drop in oil output and a 3% fall each year in gas extraction. Covid-19 lockdown measures have led to short-term drops in coal, oil and gas production this year but pandemic recovery funds are disproportionately bolstering the global fossil fuel industry, rather than clean energy. G20 governments have committed more than $233 billion in Covid-19 measures to sectors responsible for fossil fuel production and consumption. Thats compared to about $150 billion to clean energy projects, the report found. While the report highlighted some positive areas  such as Canadas commitment of $1.8 billion toward reducing methane emissions and cleaning up oil and gas wells  other stimulus measures have given unconditional support to fossil fuel production without social or environmental conditions. According to the report, they include tax cuts on fossil fuel imports in Argentina, equity and loan guarantees for the Keystone XL pipeline in Canada, a rebate on coal extraction revenue due to the Indian government, a temporary tax relief package for the oil and gas industry in Norway, and reductions in oil and gas royalty rates and the weakening of environmental regulations in the United States. This is money that is borrowed from future generations. And if we are not thorough with how this money is invested and we keep investing in fossil fuels, were going to give our children not only a climate that is in worse shape, but also will have wasted money, said Niklas Hagelberg, coordinator of the UNEPs subprogram on climate change. To meet the climate goals set out in the Paris Agreement, the reports authors say policymakers must reverse this trend. The world is now at a turning point, they say, and as countries recover and rebuild, the choice for governments is to further lock societies and economies into a high-carbon system, or build back better toward a healthier and more resilient future. The authors propose several policy options to rein in production, such as ending government subsidies for fossil fuels, placing limits on production and ensuring stimulus funds go to green investments. The report also proposes how the world can equitably transition away from fossil fuels and minimize social disruption. That includes supporting workers and communities affected by decarbonization, and providing job security, training, education, and social protection. This years devastating forest fires, floods, and droughts and other unfolding extreme weather events serve as powerful reminders for why we must succeed in tackling the climate crisis, Inger Andersen, UNEPs Executive Director said in a statement. As we seek to reboot economies following the Covid-19 pandemic, investing in low-carbon energy and infrastructure will be good for jobs, for economies, for health, and for clean air.",02/12/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/02/world/climate-production-gap-fossil-fuels-intl-hnk/index.html
"As climate change threatens Pacific Islands, some atolls have been growing. Now scientists have figured out why","Low-lying atolls in the Pacific Ocean have long been considered some of the most vulnerable areas to climate change, as rising sea levels threaten to submerge them. But over the past decade, scientists have noted a puzzling phenomenon: some islands are getting bigger. A new study released last week examined the evolution of Jeh Island, a sparsely populated atoll thats part of the Marshall Islands, a Pacific nation made up of a remote chain of coral atolls and volcanic islands between the Philippines and Hawaii. Researchers found the islands land area has increased by 13% since 1943 due to a buildup of sediments from the existing coral reef. Healthy coral reefs naturally produce sediment  in fact, thats what atolls are made of. You can still see an island grow at a time when most people and most models would suggest they should be eroding, said the studys co-author Murray Ford, an expert in Pacific reef island systems from Auckland University. Ford and Paul Kench, from Simon Fraser University in Canada, compared the islands land mass in aerial photos from 1943 and 2015. They also radiocarbon-dated sediment deposited on the island to find out when the coral remnants were alive, and discovered that sediment on parts of the island had been deposited after 1950, suggesting the islands growth is relatively new. At the same time, global sea levels have been rising. Satellite data shows waters around the Marshall Islands have risen about 7 millimeters (0.3 inches) each year since 1993, according to a Pacific Climate Change Science country report. Thats more than the global average of 2.8 to 3.6 millimeters (0.11 to 0.14 inches) per year. The new study is significant because it shows islands can continue growing, even when sea levels are rising. We have found islands are resilient in the face of rising seas and that sediment supply to some atolls is out-pacing sea level rise, Ford said. What we dont know is how that will play out in coming decades. Atolls are often only around two meters (6.6 feet) above sea level, but sea levels could rise by more than that by the end of this century, according to scientists. Sea levels are rising because greenhouse gas emissions are warming the oceans and planet, melting polar ice caps and glaciers. A 2018 US Geological Survey study found that many low-lying atolls will be uninhabitable by the middle of this century. And last year, the Asian Development Bank president Takehiko Nakao said the four atoll nations  the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu, Kiribati, and the Maldives, which are together home to more than half a million people  were the most vulnerable on the planet to climate change. For the atoll nations, climate change is not a distant threat for a future generation to face but an immediate emergency, with tropical storms and rising seas taking their toll on human lives, livelihoods, and infrastructure, Nakao said. But over the past decade, a number of studies have found that some atolls are actually getting bigger. A 2010 study showed that some Pacific islands hadnt eroded, and a 2018 study of 30 Pacific and Indian Ocean atolls, including 709 islands, found that no atoll had lost land area. More than 88% of islands were either stable or increased in area, according to the study. That started a bit of a goldrush in terms of studies, Ford said. The signal was kind of consistent  theres no widespread chronic erosion of atoll islands in the Pacific. Ford says his study is the first to not only show an island increasing in size, but also to conclusively establish why that might be happening naturally over time. This is the first time we can see the islands form, and we can say the stuff making that island is modern ... so it must be coming from the reef around the island, said Ford. Its entirely the skeletons of the reef and the organisms that live on it. The fact that some islands arent sinking doesnt mean climate change isnt an issue  it is still very much a concern. Research released in September by scientists from the University of Hawaii at Manoa shows that atoll islands face a variety of threats from rising sea levels. As sea levels get higher, islands may experience more frequent flooding that could deteriorate freshwater reserves and make atolls uninhabitable. Extreme tides could also cause coastal erosion. And scientists dont know for sure whether atolls will continue to produce sediment at a rate to stay above sea level, but the University of Hawaii researchers estimated that atolls would be impacted differently, depending on their elevation. Even within one nation, there are differences in how islands will respond, said Haunani Kane, a graduate student in geology and geophysics. And that can be difficult to predict. Atolls are formed from coral reef sediment, but reefs may not continue to produce the same levels of sediment in the future if the ecology of the reef suffers. Research shows climate change is already having a huge impact on coral reefs  a study presented earlier this year estimated that about 70-90% of all existing coral reefs are expected to disappear in the next 20 years due to warming oceans, acidic water and pollution. What happens to the ecology of the reef in the future is a big driver in what happens to the ecology of the island in the future, said Ford. If you turn off that engine room of sediment generation, then you potentially will see that effect the island. Ford said that scientists dont yet understand the time scales  if a reef died today, for instance, its not clear whether it would take a year or a decade or more for it to have an effect on the levels of sediment produced. But for people living on the islands, the fact the land mass is growing may not alleviate their fears of losing their home to climate change. According to Ford, most people who live on atolls live on parts of the islands that have been modified or developed by people. Manmade structures arent likely to experience a natural buildup of sediment, said Ford, partly due to their construction and residents desire to maintain them. Theyre not going to tolerate sand washing onto the surface of the island and interrupting their activities, he said. But residents can learn from the natural process, he added. In some ways, nature is kind of providing a template for how to adapt to sea level rises and thats to build your islands higher and to build your islands through acquiring sediment, he said. Its good news from that perspective, but it sure as heck doesnt help the ... people on the populated islands.",07/12/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/06/asia/pacific-islands-growing-intl-dst-hnk/index.html
Last month was the hottest November ever as Europe had its warmest fall on record,"The world just experienced its hottest November on record while Europe had its warmest fall, according to an alarming report from the European Unions Copernicus Climate Change Service. Temperatures were most elevated in a large region across northern Europe, Siberia and the Arctic Ocean, where sea ice was at the second lowest level ever seen in November. The United States, South America, southern Africa, the Tibetan Plateau, eastern Antarctica and most of Australia also saw temperatures well above average. Globally, November was almost 0.8 degrees Celsius (1.44 Fahrenheit) above the average for 1981-2010, and 0.1C (0.18F) higher than last year. And this unusual heat comes despite the cooling effect of La Nina. In Australia, a bushfire has been burning out of control for six weeks now in the popular tourist spot of Fraser Island as parts of the country swelter through a record-breaking heatwave. These records are consistent with the long-term warming trend of the global climate, said Carlo Buontempo, director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service at ECMWF. He said November was an exceptionally warm month globally and temperatures in the Arctic and northern Siberia remained consistently high while sea ice was near its lowest extent. This trend is concerning and highlights the importance of comprehensive monitoring of the Arctic, as it is warming faster than the rest of the world, he added. Buontempo said policymakers who prioritize mitigating climate risks should see these records as alarm bells and think more seriously than ever how to best comply with the 2015 Paris Agreement. The US pulled out of the Paris accord last month, with President Donald Trump claiming it was designed to kill the American economy, but President-elect Joe Biden has promised to reenter the pact after he is sworn in. Copernicus data shows that 2020 could be the hottest year on record. It is on a par with 2016, the warmest year ever, and is likely to equal the record or marginally exceed it unless the mercury drops this month. The World Meteorological Organizations (WMO) annual climate report last week said 2020 was on course to be one of the three warmest years on record, just after 2016 and 2019. The WMO said average global temperature was about 1.2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Global temperatures must be kept from rising above 1.5 degrees Celsius on those levels to avoid major impacts on the climate, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has said. While Decembers data will be decisive, it is almost certain that 2020 will be the warmest calendar year for Europe, Copernicus reports. The January-November period was 0.5 degrees Celsius warmer than that period in 2019  the warmest year on record  and at least 0.4 degrees warmer than the same period in any other year. In September, October and November, average European temperatures were 1.9 degrees Celsius above 1981-2010 and 0.4 degrees higher than 2006, the previous warmest fall. Most of Europe saw above average heat, with temperatures soaring the most in the northern and eastern regions. In the Arctic region and large parts of northern Siberia, temperatures have been substantially above average for all of 2020, not just the fall. Sea ice cover has been particularly low since the beginning of summer and Siberian wildfires released record emissions. An earlier version of this story misstated the Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion for the global temperature increase. This has been corrected.",07/12/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/07/weather/november-2020-hottest-month-climate-intl/index.html
"Unlike Trump, Biden believes in climate change ?and his nominees prove it","President-elect Joe Biden will restore key features of the presidency that have been absent for the past four years, chief among them a belief that humans cause climate change. Biden made his commitment to science abundantly clear in announcing the nominations of his economic, health and environment teams. Experts have warned that inaction on climate change has put the world on a suicidal path leading to an uninhabitable hell. And President Donald Trump has done little to help matters. During his presidency, Trump has shown us the damage that comes from his misguided ideas about global warming and his bent toward a pro-polluter agenda. The Trump administration has moved to reverse more than 100 environmental safeguards and weakened our global standing by withdrawing the United States from the Paris Climate Accord and the World Health Organization. Now his administration wants to allow fossil fuel companies to drill in the Arctic national refuge, while refusing to tighten soot pollution standards in his 11th-hour attempt to deregulate and degrade environmental standards before he leaves office. Whats worse is that Trump has made these decisions despite record high temperatures, intense hurricanes and scorching wildfires, which are impacting millions of people, even as a deadly pandemic has led to both a public health and economic crisis. The incoming Biden administration presents a new era in the fight against climate change. His team isnt just faced with the challenge of undoing the damage to our environment caused by the Trump administration over the past four years  but it must also meet the rapidly worsening climate crisis with bold, historic climate action. Even before he enters the Oval Office, Biden has pledged that he will act on his climate mandate promptly. He has vowed to rejoin the Paris agreement and World Health Organization, prioritize climate action and restore the United States reputation as the worlds clean energy leader. His roster of senior economic advisers  Janet Yellen, Neera Tanden, Jared Bernstein and Heather Boushey  are climate champions who have proven their commitment to addressing climate change and will bring that perspective to their leadership roles as they advise the President on how to rebuild our economy in a sustainable fashion. During the event where Biden announced these appointments, Yellen even opined that we need to address the climate crisis with American ingenuity and American jobs. Biden knows that building a clean energy economy and ensuring American workers have good green jobs is key to the fight against climate change. Putting these climate advocates in charge of our economic policies will ensure that the American economy is actually built back better and ready for the future by reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, while investing in green infrastructure and clean energy jobs that pay workers a good wage. The historic appointment of former Secretary of State John Kerry as a special presidential envoy for climate is also critical because of his expertise and experience on the global stage. Biden has repeatedly emphasized that his administrations climate ambition will touch all aspects of government, including national security, public health, foreign relations, economic policy and racial justice. Kerry will be able to implement Bidens plans. To meet these public health needs, Biden has picked Xavier Becerra to run the Department of Health and Human Services. As California Attorney General, Becerra created the first environmental justice bureau and successfully fought Trumps environmental rollbacks. Biden also named Vivek Murthy, a vocal advocate on the consequences of climate change for public health, to serve as Surgeon General. Finally, Bidens announcement this week that he has nominated New Mexico Rep. Deb Haaland to serve as Secretary of the Interior is historic, as she is the first Native American to hold the position and will spearhead efforts to protect land, air and water  especially on tribal land that has long been exploited by the department  from pollution. Biden has also named Michael Regan, who has significant experience with fighting pollution, to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. Regan is a smart pick to have at the forefront of prioritizing environmental justice and making Bidens bold climate agenda a reality. As Trump uses the final moments of his presidency to advocate an anti-environment agenda, Biden is setting the framework for his administration with a team of experts that will focus on the whole picture  including the role of climate change and environmental injustice  as they engage the most pressing public health issues of our time.",18/12/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/18/opinions/biden-nominees-bold-climate-action-reid/index.html
"2020 was meant to be the year of climate action. Instead, it crowned a wasted decade","2020 was supposed to be the watershed moment for action on climate change, the year the world woke up to the challenge and started taking it seriously. Instead, it has symbolically topped a decade of wasted climate promises. Inspired by a wave of climate activism, national leaders were expected to come up with new, more ambitious plans for how to cut emissions over the next decade. The COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland, was going to be the first real test of their determination to do what they had promised to, under the landmark Paris Agreement. The coronavirus pandemic has derailed those plans, giving some governments a new excuse to stall. But Covid-19 definitely hasnt stopped climate change. 2020 has brought near-constant reminders of the severity of the crisis we face: A record-breaking Atlantic hurricane season, the most devastating wildfires in recent history, and droughts, deadly floods and heatwaves that swept through communities worldwide, leaving death, destruction and disruption in their wake. The pandemic has also showed the world that big, previously unthinkable changes are possible. Despite the global upheaval, several of the worlds largest polluters did raise their long-term climate goals, putting the world within striking distance of the Paris Agreements goal: To reduce emissions and so limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius. Experts are cautiously optimistic. Theres now a recognition that when the worlds main economies are minded to, they can intervene and correct these market failures, said Mike Davis, CEO of Global Witness, an NGO that focuses on human rights, climate and the environment. Weve seen this to some extent in response to Covid, and perhaps that has begun to chip away at this myth that essentially were all slaves to the free market, [and] theres nothing that we can do. The effects of climate change have become harder than ever to ignore in 2020. According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), 2020 is on track to become the third hottest year on record, after 2016 and 2019  and thats despite the cooling effect of La Nina. The period between 2011 and 2020 will be the warmest decade on record. But global warming is just one aspect of the climate crisis. The major impacts of climate change have been felt through drought, flooding, sea level rise, stronger tropical storms, hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones and also melting of the glaciers, Petteri Taalas, secretary-general of the WMO, told CNN. The Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre in Geneva (IDMC) said there had been nearly 10 million climate-related displacements in the first six months of the year as people were forced from their homes by disasters that were either caused or worsened by climate change. For some the move was temporary, but many are facing long-term displacement. India, Bangladesh and the Philippines were the three worst-impacted countries, totaling more than 6 million displacements between them. Developing countries are often hit disproportionately hard by the impacts of climate change because of their location and the lack of access to the funds and technologies that could help mitigate the effects. But 2020 showed that no country is immune to such disruption. Hundreds of thousands of people from some of the worlds richest countries were forced out of their homes, lost their livelihoods  and sometimes their lives  because of fires, storms and floods. An estimated 53,000 people in the US and 51,000 more in Australia were displaced in the first six months of the year alone. And wherever such disasters happen, the poorest still suffer the most, according to Alexandra Bilak from the IDMC. Even in high-income countries  in California for example  there are people who didnt have access to insurance and who did lose everything, and theyre the ones we are particularly concerned about because theyre the ones who are going to end up in very protracted situations where their vulnerabilities are going to increase, she said. The effects of climate change were devastating in 2020, but they could become even more disastrous if global warming continues in line with current trends. The WMO says there is now at least a one-in-five chance that average global temperatures will temporarily exceed pre-industrial levels by 1.5 degree Celsius by 2024  a critical threshold in the Paris Agreement. Under the deal, most of the world agreed to limit warming to below 2 degrees Celsius  and to aim to keep it to 1.5 degrees. We are already at 1.2 degrees warming and the IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] says that for the welfare of mankind and also for the welfare of biosphere, the 1.5 degree target would be more favored, Taalas said. With the 2 degrees target, we would see more negative impacts of climate change, it would harm global food production capacity, there would be plenty of coastal cities that would suffer from sea level rise, and we would see more category 4 and 5 hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones. Global greenhouse gas emissions need to fall by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 if theres any chance of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, and by 25% to keep it to below 2 degrees, according to the IPCC. The good news, Taalas said, is that we have both the technological and economic means to reach those targets. The bad news? Most nations still havent adopted concrete plans to get there. Emissions fell during springs coronavirus lockdown and the WMO estimates that, as a result, they will be between 4.2% and 7.5% lower this year compared to 2019. But the effect of the fall is negligible. Because carbon stays in the atmosphere for a long time, the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere surged to a new record high again this year. To reach the climate targets, emissions need to fall by at least the same amount  about 7.6%  each year over the next decade. There is a chance this could happen. Until recently, I guess everyone had been quite depressed about the way policies and actions were developing on climate change, Bill Hare, CEO of Climate Analytics, told CNN. Hare said there has been an understandable slowdown in action because of the pandemic: It seemed that political momentum was draining away, but in the last six or eight weeks, particularly since September when President Xi Jinping of China announced Chinas move towards net zero emissions before 2060, the whole mood has changed. South Africa, Japan, South Korea and Canada have all announced new 2050 net zero targets, following pledges by China, the EU and the UK. And while the US withdrew from the Paris Agreement under President Donald Trump, the incoming Biden administration is widely expected to announce a new 2050 net zero target. According to analysis by the Climate Action Tracker, these new pledges put the world within striking distance of the Paris Agreement target. The tracker, a partnership between the NewClimate Institute and Climate Analytics, said current plans would translate into 2.1 degrees of warming by 2100. But the new pledges are just that  promises to achieve something in three decades time, when most of the current governments will be long gone. The acid test is whether or not countries really will step up action in the near term for 2030, Hare said. The 2050 and 2060 targets are steps in the right direction and shouldnt be underestimated, but what really matters is what governments do now. The next decade will be the true make-or-break moment.",30/12/2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/30/world/climate-change-2020-wasted-year-intl/index.html
BP CEO and climate leader: We can only fight climate change if businesses help,"We may look to be strange bedfellows  a global leader on climate change and the chief executive of a multinational oil company  but we share two characteristics that the world needs more than ever: stubborn optimism and a fierce commitment to inclusivity. Both are qualities that five years ago, at the end of 2015, enabled the world to come together in Paris and find a way forward on climate change. The Paris Agreement commits countries to reducing their carbon output, keeping global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, with efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees. Now we begin the second year of the most decisive decade in history, where concrete action is crucial to meeting the goals of the landmark agreement. Since Paris, well over 100 countries have pledged to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or sooner. This means only emitting as much as can be balanced through absorption  for example, by forests, peat bogs, mangroves, soil and seaweed forests  and will require massive reductions in the emissions currently being released into the atmosphere. With Joe Bidens inauguration as US president this month, and the expectation that the United States will rejoin the Paris Agreement, countries planning to make dramatic reductions in their greenhouse gas emissions make up almost two-thirds of the worlds current emissions and 50% of global gross domestic product. Arguably, the Paris Agreement has had an equally powerful effect on companies as it has on countries. In just the past 12 months, over 1,000 companies have set themselves net-zero targets. And these are not small companies. According to the Princes Responsible Business network, 45% of FTSE 100 companies are now committed to net zero by 2050 or sooner. If anything, companies are outpacing governments in embracing the Paris goals  which is exactly what the world needs. Governments regulate and incentivize, but actually cutting emissions largely falls on others to implement. Companies have to do much of that  and society has a stake in helping them. How can we accelerate that change further and faster? If you are a job seeker, look beyond companies that havent published clear plans for reducing carbon emissions and apply for positions at firms that are genuinely committed to making a difference  not just ones that are already green, but companies committed to making themselves greener by aiming for net zero. If you are an investor who wants to allocate capital responsibly, deploy it in green companies. But also use it to back the corporations looking to shift from brown to green. Support those driving real carbon cuts and implementing climate-resilient strategies. Governments that want to achieve their net-zero ambitions while creating conditions that allow todays green companies to thrive, must find ways to make every company  big and small  want to be a green company. In 2015, when countries came together in Paris, the vital lesson we all learned was that we can only move forward when we hold everyones ability to play their part in equal regard. The agreement creates a common framework for action  for richer and poorer countries alike  while recognizing their different circumstances and needs. Achieving the Paris goals will take action from everyone  not just countries, but companies, local governments and even individuals. On the road to the 2021 UN Climate Change Conference, COP26, in Glasgow in November, this lesson is paramount. Big, established companies in high-emissions sectors such as energy, transport and heavy industry have an important part to play. These companies, acting with the highest levels of integrity  and with the backing of governments, investors and society  have the scale and capabilities that are necessary to enable rapid and substantial reductions in emissions. Last year BP announced an ambition to be a net-zero company by 2050 and to help the world get to net zero. It also set out a new strategy for the 111-year-old company  with aims to increase low-carbon investment 10-fold, cut oil and gas production by 40% and reduce emissions by 35% to 40%  all by 2030. Its a bold step in the right direction. Engaging companies with the most carbon to cut is vital to meeting climate goals. They need to be part of the transition to lower and no-carbon solutions if there is to be any chance of meeting the promise of the Paris Agreement. More and more companies are looking to play their part, and the worlds expectations that they will do so are high. Embracing decarbonization as an opportunity, not a burden, has spurred many large companies to commit to achieving net-zero emissions as rapidly as they can  for some, this is by 2040 or sooner, while other sectors are harder to abate and will need more time to do so. Its in everyones interests to increase momentum until we can no longer count the companies involved. With the opportunity to achieve 1.5 degrees under threat, we must keep the door to participation wide open. The world needs everyone working together on this crucial cause  and fast.",05/01/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/05/perspectives/bp-climate-change-paris-agreement/index.html
2020 was tied for the hottest year ever recorded ?but the disasters fueled by climate change set it apart,"Global average temperatures last year were tied for the hottest on record, capping what was also the planets hottest decade ever recorded, according to new data analysis released Friday. The last six years are now the hottest six on record, with 2020 on par with 2016 as the hottest year ever recorded. The new analysis comes from the European Unions Copernicus Climate Change Service, one of several datasets which track global temperatures and climate change impacts. Last years temperatures were 0.6 degrees Celsius (1.08 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the 1981 to 2010 average, and 1.25 degrees Celsius (2.25 degrees Fahrenheit) above the pre-industrial average. Global warming has brought the planet ever closer to the 1.5 degree Celsius warming threshold, which scientists have warned will increase the risk for more extreme wildfires, droughts, floods and food shortages potentially impacting hundreds of millions of people. However, it was abundantly clear in 2020 that the world is already seeing worsening disasters from climate change. It began in January, when heat and drought stoked unprecedented wildfires across Australia. When the flames were finally extinguished, the fires had charred an area larger than the state of Florida. An analysis last year found that climate change made the fires at least 30% more likely. Then came the Atlantic hurricane season, which saw a record-breaking 30 named storms, 12 of which made landfall in the US. Many of those storms carried the fingerprints of climate change, which scientists say is making hurricanes more destructive. Extremely hot and dry conditions also fueled the worst wildfire season ever recorded in the Western US, which engulfed an estimated 10.3 million acres in flames. And in the Arctic, some of the most extreme temperatures anywhere on Earth were observed in 2020, as the region continues to warm more than twice as fast as the rest of the planet. Huge parts of the Arctic saw temperatures more than 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) above average, and some locations saw average temperatures more than 6 degrees Celsius (10.8 degrees Fahrenheit) above normal for the year. To illustrate how enormous a 6 degree Celsius difference can be  during the last ice age, which occurred around 20,000 years ago and featured much of North America covered in ice, the planets average temperature was about 6 degrees Celsius cooler than it is today. 2020 stands out for its exceptional warmth in the Arctic and a record number of tropical storms in the North Atlantic, said Carlo Buontempo, the director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, in a news release. It is no surprise that the last decade was the warmest on record, and is yet another reminder of the urgency of ambitious emissions reductions to prevent adverse climate impacts in the future. Making the heat in 2020 all the more startling is the fact that the year featured La Nina, a naturally occurring climate cycle characterized by cooler than normal temperatures in the Pacific Ocean. The large expanse of cooler ocean water and the resulting impacts on the global climate act like a natural air conditioner for the planet, and La Nina years tend to make the planet cooler than years without a La Nina or the opposite phase of the cycle, called El Nino. El Nino, which features warmer than average ocean temperatures in the Pacific, adds large amounts of excess heat released into the atmosphere and tends to make those years warmer. It is no surprise that 2016, which had previously been the hottest year on record, featured a strong El Nino for the first half of the year. It is remarkable, however, that even with the cooling effects of La Nina present, that 2020 would feature the same amount of global heat. This provides yet another yardstick to measure the impact that human-caused global warming is having on the planets climate. 2020 set another record according to Copernicus Climate Change Service, with carbon dioxide concentrations reaching a maximum of 413 parts per million (ppm) during May. It may seem counterintuitive that a year dominated by Covid-related shutdowns and a halt to global production and transportation would have the highest CO2 levels of any on record. But the fact is that until fossil fuel production reaches net-zero, or carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere on a major, globally-coordinated scale, each year will likely see higher carbon dioxide levels than the last. The increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration in 2020 was slightly less than what was seen in each of the past two years (2.3 ppm vs 2.5 and 2.4 in 2019 and 2018, respectively). This could partly be the result of Covid-related shutdowns, which some estimates show reduced human CO2 emissions in 2020 by around 7%, according to the Global Carbon Project. However, more research is needed to determine exactly how big of a role the pandemic played in cutting emissions last year.",08/01/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/08/weather/2020-global-temperatures-tied-for-warmest-on-record-copernicus/index.html
"US carbon emissions fell 10% in 2020, because of the pandemic. It? up to Biden to stop them from bouncing back","US greenhouse gas emissions dropped dramatically in 2020, helping the country meet one of its long-standing climate targets. But the dip came at a great economic cost  and experts warn that unless climate action becomes a priority, emissions will bounce back quickly. The crisis sparked by the coronavirus pandemic caused US emissions to drop by 10.3% last year, according to preliminary estimates by the Rhodium Group, a private data analytics firm. That is the single biggest drop in annual emissions in the post-World War II era, the group said. By comparison, the 2009 economic recession caused emissions to drop 6.3%. Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases trap solar radiation in the atmosphere, just like the glass traps heat in a greenhouse. This causes temperatures to rise and drives more extreme weather, ice melt, sea level rise and ocean acidification. Last years dramatic plunge means the US has met a key emission-cutting target set by the Obama administration. Under the 2009 Copenhagen Accord, the US pledged that by 2020, it will have cut its emissions by 17% from 2005 levels. Because of the pandemic, emissions were 21.5% lower in 2020, compared to 2005. However, 2020 should not in any way be considered a down payment toward the US meeting its 2025 Paris Agreement target of 26-28% below 2005 levels, the authors of the Rhodium Group report said. With coronavirus vaccines now in distribution, we expect economic activity to pick up again in 2021, but without meaningful structural changes in the carbon intensity of the US economy, emissions will likely rise again as well, they wrote. US climate action has stalled under President Donald Trump, but President-elect Joe Biden has promised to put climate at the center of his agenda. Biden has said that the US will rejoin the Paris Agreement on his first day in office, and promised to take a number of executive actions to combat the climate crisis. Its not just the US. Global Carbon Project estimates that emissions of heat-trapping gases decreased by around 7% globally last year. That might look like a significant drop, but it wont make any meaningful difference to climate change. Carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for centuries, and last years decline is little more than a blip on the graph. The concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere actually surged to a new record high last year, the World Meteorological Organization said in November. Under the Paris Agreement, the vast majority of nations agreed to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees. To reach that goal, greenhouse emissions need to drop dramatically and soon. The United Nations calculated last year that to stay within the 1.5 degrees limit, emissions would need to fall by 7.6% each year from 2020 to 2030. To achieve that, the world needs to radically change the way it sources its energy. This [emissions] decline didnt happen as a result of strong government policies or major penetration of clean energy technologies  this decline happened mainly as result of the economic downturn [and] pandemic, Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, said at a news conference on Monday. Emissions dropped largely because the pandemic brought some of the economys most polluting sectors to a halt. Transportation, which accounts for almost a third of all US emissions, was the biggest victim of the downturn. The Rhodium Group said that at the peak of lockdowns in April and May, demand for jet fuel had dropped 68% year on year, with gasoline down 40% and diesel 18% lower. As a result, greenhouse gas emissions from transportation plunged by 14.7% last year, compared to 2019. But there are signs the drop was just temporary. According to the US Energy Information Administration, demand for jet fuel in the US is recovering faster than in many other markets. Emissions from industrial activities were down 7% in 2020 compared to 2019, also because of the major slowdown in the economy. There is some good news too. Emissions from the US energy sector declined by 10.3% in 2020. And unlike the drops in transportation and industry, this wasnt driven by the economic collapse, but by the shift away from coal to renewable resources. About a fifth, or 20%, of US power was generated by burning coal in 2020, compared to 24% in 2019. The share of renewables rose to 18% last year from 16% in 2019. Despite the drop last year, the US remains the worlds second biggest emitter after China. It is by far the biggest emitter historically, meaning that no country has put more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than the US. Since reaching a peak in 2007, US emissions have declined by 1.3% per year, on average, according to the US Energy Information Administration.",12/01/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/12/us/climate-us-emissions-2020-intl/index.html
"Climate change is making baby sharks smaller, undernourished and exhausted","Baby sharks are being born smaller, undernourished and exhausted as climate change warms the worlds oceans, researchers say. Researchers examined the effects of warming temperatures on the growth, development and physiology of the Great Barrier Reefs epaulette sharks, testing embryos and hatchlings in waters up to 31 degrees Celsius (87.8 degrees Fahrenheit). The research team found that in warmer waters, shark embryos grew faster and used their yolk sac  their only source of food in this developmental stage  quicker. The creatures hatched earlier, were born smaller, and needed to feed straight away, but lacked energy, researchers from Australias ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University and the University of Massachusetts said Tuesday. There are more than 500 types of shark living around the world, and the majority give birth to live young. Some shark species, like epaulette sharks, lay eggs, which are left unprotected and must be able to survive on their own for up to four months. The epaulette shark is known for its resilience to change, even to ocean acidification, Jodie Rummer, co-author and associate professor at the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, said in a statement. So, if this species cant cope with warming waters then how will other, less tolerant species fare? The Great Barrier Reef is the worlds largest coral reef, covering nearly 133,000 square miles and is home to more than 1,500 species of fish, 411 species of hard corals and dozens of other species. The past decade has been the warmest on record for global ocean temperatures. By the end of the century, the Great Barrier Reef is likely to experience average summer temperatures close to or exceeding 31 degrees Celsius, researchers warn. Rummer said that rising ocean temperatures could threaten future sharks, including egg-laying and live-bearing species, because as temperatures rise, the creatures will be born or hatch into environments that they can barely tolerate. The study presents a worrying future given that sharks are already threatened, lead author Carolyn Wheeler said in a statement. Sharks are important predators that keep ocean ecosystems healthy. Without predators, whole ecosystems can collapse, which is why we need to keep studying and protecting these creatures, Wheeler, a PhD candidate at the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, added. Our future ecosystems depend (on) us taking urgent action to limit climate change, Rummer said. The study was published in the Scientific Reports journal. Oceans serve as a good indicator of the real impact of climate change  covering almost three quarters of Earths surface, they absorb the vast majority of the worlds heat. Although we often cant see it, ocean warming has a profound impact on the entire world. A warmer ocean causes sea level to rise, bringing problems like dangerous coastal flooding. It leads to the loss of sea ice, heating the waters even further, and can affect the jet stream, allowing cold Arctic air to reach farther south, making winters more intense and threatening animals that depend on sea ice. A warmer ocean also contributes to increases in rainfall and leads to stronger and longer-lasting storms like Hurricanes Florence and Harvey. Marine heatwaves which have killed off swathes of Earths coral reefs have likely doubled in frequency and are projected to become more common and intense, a landmark report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found in 2019.",12/01/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/12/australia/baby-shark-climate-intl-scli-scn/index.html
Oil giant splits from powerful lobbying group over climate change,"The American Petroleum Institute, the nations largest and most powerful oil lobby, is losing one of its biggest members over a disagreement about addressing the climate crisis. Frances Total announced Friday it is quitting the API because of the lobbys stances on regulation and carbon pricing as well as its support for politicians who oppose the Paris climate agreement. The move makes Total the first major oil company to leave the API because of the climate crisis. The exit underscores the divide in the oil industry over how to respond to climate change. Top European oil companies including Total and BP have made more aggressive promises to slash carbon emissions and invest in clean energy than ExxonMobil (XOM), Chevron and other US firms. The move also comes amid a broader reckoning in Corporate America over political contributions following the insurrection at the US Capitol. This is a serious blow for API, whose influence largely stems from its claim to be the voice of the entire oil and gas industry, Andrew Logan, director of oil and gas at sustainability nonprofit Ceres, said in a statement. He added the split is likely to mark the beginning of an exodus from the trade group. Founded in 1919, the API now has more than 600 members, including ExxonMobil, Chevron (CVX), ConocoPhillips (COP), BP and Shell. Total has helped lead the industry response to the climate crisis. Last year, Total announced a goal to get to net-zero emissions by 2050. Importantly, that goal included the so-called scope 3 emissions from the products it sells, namely gasoline, jet fuel and diesel. For major oil-and-gas companies, scope 3 can comprise as much as 85% of total emissions, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. We are committed to ensuring, in a transparent manner, that the industry associations of which we are a member adopt positions and messages that are aligned with those of the group in the fight against climate change, Patrick Pouyanne, Totals CEO, said in a statement. Total said a detailed analysis of APIs climate positions revealed the lobby is only partially aligned with the company. Total cited several divergences, including APIs support for rolling back US regulation on methane emissions, which the company opposed in November 2019. Total also noted that API is part of the Transportation Fairness Alliance, which is opposed to providing subsidies for electric vehicles. Additionally, Total said that during the recent elections, API supported candidates who opposed the United States participation in the Paris climate agreement. President-elect Joe Biden has promised to swiftly return the nation to the accord. Indeed, InfluenceMap, a London-based think tank focused on energy and climate change, said the API appears to be broadly hostile to progressive climate policy. The group gives the API an F in terms of how aligned its climate policy is to the Paris agreement. In a statement, the API defended its climate record and thanked Total for its membership. We believe that the worlds energy and environmental challenges are large enough that many different approaches are necessary to solve them, and we benefit from a diversity of views, an API spokesperson said. The API said it supports the ambitions of the Paris Agreement, including global action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and alleviate poverty around the globe. Mike Sommers, APIs CEO, said during a call with reporters this week that the group wants to work with President-elect Biden and the EPA on reducing methane emissions. Were open to the possibility of further regulation in this space, Sommers said, adding that the Biden administration should collaborate with the industry to come up with regulation that can actually survive judicial scrutiny. Edward Collins, director of corporate climate lobbying at InfluenceMap, said Totals departure will place pressure on BP and Shell to seriously examine their own memberships. Both European oil companies have promised to overhaul their businesses as they transition to low-carbon energy. And they both plan to get to net-zero emissions by 2050. In a statement, BP (BP) said it actively monitors its membership in trade associations, especially those we view as only partially aligned with us on climate-related issues. We remain committed to trying to influence those associations from within, BP said, adding that it plans to publish a trade association update in the second quarter. Shell (RDSA) said that it regularly reviews its membership in industry associations, but it signaled no imminent exit from the API. Specific to climate, API is moving closer to Shells own stated views, a Shell spokesman told CNN Business. As a result, we feel its beneficial to remain a member so that we can continue to advocate for change from within.",15/01/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/15/investing/oil-climate-api-total/index.html
Two former Trump officials to be investigated for posting papers denying climate change,"The Commerce Departments Office of Inspector General said it will investigate how two former Trump officials posted dubious papers questioning man-made climate change using government logos but without the approval of the Trump administration. After careful consideration, we decided to review this matter further, the Commerce Departments Office of Inspector General wrote in a Friday letter to Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono, who requested the investigation along with fellow Democratic Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse, Elizabeth Warren, Ed Markey and Richard Blumenthal. The New York Times first reported the investigation. The Washington Post reported earlier this month that the White House Office of Science and Technology had reassigned Trump appointees David Legates and Ryan Maue, both senior officials from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who had been with OSTP since November, after it was discovered they posted the controversial documents on nongovernment websites. The papers used the imprint of the Executive Office of the President and noted they were copyrighted by OSTP even though the OSTP director never approved, The Post reported. Legates, the main author on the series of papers, according to the Post, is a longtime climate change skeptic who was originally appointed by the Trump administration to help run NOAA and soon after became the head of the US Global Change Research Program, which coordinates climate change research.",24/01/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/23/politics/david-legates-ryan-maue-trump-officials-climate-change-mazie-hirono/index.html
"Almost two-thirds of people believe climate change is a global emergency, UN poll finds","Nearly two-thirds of respondents believe that climate change is a global emergency, according to a survey of 1.2 million people in dozens of countries around the globe  and many want urgent action to tackle the problem. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), which ran the poll with Oxford University, described it as the largest survey of public opinion on climate change ever conducted. Unusually, it captured the views of more than half a million people under the age of 18, a key but typically hard-to-reach constituency, the organization said. The Peoples Climate Vote was undertaken late last year in 50 high, middle and low income countries that together account for more than half of the worlds population over the age of 14, according to the UNDP report. Across those countries, 64% of people said climate change was an emergency, presenting a clear and convincing call for decision-makers to step up on ambition, the report said. Of the people that said climate change is a global emergency, 59% said that the world should do everything necessary and urgently in response, it added. A further 20% backed acting slowly, while 10% thought the world was already doing enough. While younger people showed the greatest concern over climate change, with 69% of those aged 14-17 saying there is a climate emergency, around two-thirds of those aged 18 to 59 and 58% of those aged 60 and over agreed. This illustrates how widely held this view has become, the UNDP said. Its polling also indicated that majorities backed climate action even when it would have a significant impact on their own country, at a time when much of the world is reeling from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Respondents were asked where they would most like to see action, with questions on support for 18 policy options across six areas  energy, economy, transportation, farms and food, protecting people, and nature. Four climate policies emerged as the most popular globally, with 54% of those surveyed favoring conservation of forests and land, 53% choosing increased use of renewable energy, 52% supporting climate-friendly farming techniques and 50% wanting more investment in green businesses and jobs. The promotion of plant-based diets was the least popular, with only 30% support. There were clear calls for renewable energy even in higher emitting countries such as the United States, Australia and Canada, the UNDP report said. It also found strong backing for action to conserve forests and land in countries with high emissions from deforestation and land-use change, such as Brazil, Indonesia and Argentina. The results of the survey clearly illustrate that urgent climate action has broad support amongst people around the globe, across nationalities, age, gender and education level, Achim Steiner, UNDP administrator, said in a news release. From climate-friendly farming to protecting nature, and investing in a green recovery from Covid-19, the survey brings the voice of the people to the forefront of the climate debate. It signals ways in which countries can move forward with public support as we work together to tackle this enormous challenge, he said. The publication of the survey comes as many countries are preparing for the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference (also known as COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland, in November. In the United States, President Joe Biden has put action to combat climate change high on his agenda. He is expected to sign several executive actions related to climate on Wednesday, including issuing a moratorium on new oil and gas leases on federal lands, according to a person familiar with his plans. This follows on from a series of steps last week aimed at reprioritizing environmental issues. Biden halted more than 100 regulatory actions taken by the Trump administration, announced the US would rejoin the Paris climate agreement and canceled the Keystone XL pipeline. The UNDP poll was undertaken as part of a wider UN campaign to educate people about climate change solutions and ask their opinions on actions to address the climate crisis. Global average temperatures last year were tied for the hottest on record, capping what was also the planets hottest decade ever recorded, according to data analysis released earlier this month. The last six years are now the hottest six on record, with 2020 on par with 2016 as the hottest year ever recorded. The highest level of public belief in the climate emergency, at 74%, was found in people living in small island developing states, the UNDP report said, followed by people in high income countries (72%). It stood at 62% in middle income countries, while the least developed countries saw the lowest level of support, at 58%. A majority across all regions said climate change was a global emergency, with the highest level of agreement in Western Europe and North America, at 72%, and the lowest in Sub-Saharan Africa, at 61%. The UNDP poll sought to reach people under the age of 18 by distributing its questions through adverts in game apps on mobile phones. This new and unconventional approach to polling allowed its authors to reach a huge, unique, and random sample of people of all genders, ages, and educational backgrounds, the UNDP said. The poll found that the more education a person had completed, the more likely they were to think there was a climate emergency, regardless of where they lived. With the onset of the Covid-19 crisis, the Peoples Climate Vote took on added meaning by providing insight into perceptions about the climate crisis in the context of a global pandemic, the report said. Many of the policy choices in the Peoples Climate Vote  whether relating to jobs, energy, protecting nature or company regulation  speak to issues that countries are facing as they chart their recoveries. Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the public level of belief in the climate emergency as the level of support for climate action. It also included a graphic that mischaracterized the United Nations Development Programme surveys methodology. The story has been corrected and the graphic has been removed. The story has also been updated to clarify the surveyed populations age range.",27/01/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/27/world/un-climate-poll-global-emergency-intl/index.html
Why West Virginia is central to Biden? climate crisis plans,"Joe Manchin once shot a hole in the climate-saving plan of his own party. Literally. It was 2010 and, as he ran to be a senator from coal country, the Democrat reminded West Virginia that I sued the EPA and will take dead aim at the Cap-and-Trade bill, before raising his rifle and blasting a copy of the proposed legislation pinned to plywood. A decade later, Manchin is just a skosh left of center in a 50-50 Senate  an important vote for any legislation President Joe Biden wishes to pass from his agenda, which includes a climate plan vastly more ambitious than any in US history. With two rounds of executive orders, the new President is commanding every agency in the government be guided by the best science in rolling back dozens of Trump-era breaks and bonuses given to coal, oil and gas companies. Hes halted any new drilling and fracking leases on federal land and water, given climate hawks like John Kerry and Gina McCarthy Cabinet-level powers and, within hours of taking the oath, rejoined the 185 nations that have ratified the promise of the Paris Accord to break humanitys fossil fuel addiction. We come back, I want you to know, with humility for the absence of the last four years, and well do everything in our power to make up for it, Kerry told a United Nations conference on climate change adaptation this week. Im so happy to hear John say this, replied Mark Rutte, Prime Minister of the Netherlands. Because we need the US at the center of the action. Scientists insist that to halt the out-of-control overheating and avoid destruction by fossil fuel, humanity will need a sweeping Industrial Revolution 2.0, and fast. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, is urging Biden to declare a climate emergency and use the enhanced powers the way Trump used them on his border wall. But the President can only do so much with the stroke of a pen. Opposition is almost assured from Republicans like Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who has already turned Donald Trumps line I represent the people of Pittsburgh, not Paris into a Pittsburgh > Paris bumper sticker. In reality, Biden won Allegheny County, where 81% say carbon dioxide should be regulated as pollution and two-thirds of Americans support the Paris reunion, including nearly a quarter of Republicans. And if there is no Republican support for the change that can only come from legislation, Biden really needs Joe Manchin. While the senator declined our request for an interview, a statement released on inauguration day said: I agree that President Biden must renew Americas leadership on climate change through innovation. It is an issue that threatens every community, in every country across the globe. I also uphold my view that the Paris Agreement must be improved to set all nations on the same stage and hold each to the same standards of accountability. Not exactly a ringing endorsement from the incoming chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Even the American Petroleum Institute and the US Chamber of Commerce appear more excited about Bidens decision. Its hard to substantiate which one is more or less of a threat, said Varshini Prakash, co-founder of the Sunrise Movement, when I asked if she is more worried about Ted Cruz or Joe Manchin. We will need to put pressure on Republicans who are up for reelection in the Senate in 2022. We will need to put pressure on Democrats who are in more conservative states right now. We will need to also pressure leadership like Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi to fight like hell to pass climate policy, not just cater to those who are holding us back from Congress, she said. And as part of a coalition that successfully pushed Biden to be much more ambitious, she hopes Democrats will blow up the filibuster and pass automatic voter registration. I think the key here is that Joe Biden cannot litigate these issues behind closed doors with obstructionist Republicans, she added. He cannot immediately moderate or temper his vision. Theres this false sense that just taking a policy and moderating it or making it milquetoast will make it apply to a broader swath of people. But thats simply not true. We are miles past what I thought was impossible at the beginning of the primary campaign, says David Wallace Wells, author of The Uninhabitable Earth, a best-selling roundup of the latest climate science and real-time evidence of the cost of willful ignorance. In a recent piece, he declared the war on climate denial has been won. Given the surge of ambition from Beijing to DC and the fact that a Republican Senate voted 92-6 to include $35 billion worth of green spending in a Covid relief bill, he has fresh optimism. Were seeing movement even among people on the right, he told me. Again, they are not moving nearly fast enough. But I think its a sign that the conceptual terms under which we are conducting our political arguments have really shifted. I think were seeing this because were seeing climate change. But will Manchin see it through his rifle scope or a lens of approval? Both his father and grandfather were mayors of a small mining town and every one of his political calculations begins with the welfare of the 20,000 West Virginians who depend on the fossil fuel industry to survive. But his score from the League of Conservation Voters went from 20 to 86 in recent years as he joined Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski to push through the biggest public lands bill in a decade, and helped champion that $35 billion green spending spree with his hope that carbon-capture innovation can save West Virginias core industry. There is one more thing to complicate matters for Manchin, Biden, and every form of life on Earth: This test is timed.",27/01/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/27/politics/climate-crisis-biden-executive-actions-analysis-weir-wxc/index.html
"France not doing enough to tackle climate change, court rules","A Paris court has found France legally responsible for its failure to meet targets intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The lawsuit was launched by four NGOs, including Greenpeace France and Oxfam France, following an online petition that gathered 2.3 million signatures  the largest in French history, according to organizers. Signatories hoped to compel the State to take all necessary measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to meet the 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) target set by the Paris Agreement, according to the online petition. The Paris Agreement was signed by almost all the worlds countries, and seeks to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). France, which brokered the pact, has committed to reducing greenhouse gases by 40% by 2030, and has set itself a target of being carbon neutral by 2050. But NGOs accused the countrys authorities of insufficient policy actions needed to tackle climate change, and said that greenhouse gas emissions under the current government dropped at a pace that was twice as slow as the trajectories foreseen under the law. Paris administrative court on Wednesday ordered the state to pay one euro ($1.20) for moral damage to each of the associations behind the lawsuit, ruling that government failures undermined the collective interests defended by each of the applicant associations, the court said in its official communique on the case. Despite only symbolic damages being awarded, the charities hailed the result. This decision marks a first historic victory for the climate and a major advance in French law. This judgment also marks a victory for the truth: Until now, the state has denied that its climate policies were insufficient, despite mounting evidence, they said in a statement. This is the first recognition by the courts of the responsibility of the French State for its climate inaction, Clementine Baldon, a lawyer for one of the NGOs, said at a press conference following the ruling. The judges examined whether there was a causal link between this ecological damage and the various breaches alleged against the state in the fight against climate change. They held that the state should be held responsible for part of this damage if it failed to meet its commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the court statement read. In order to determine the measures to be ordered to the state to repair the damage caused or prevent its aggravation, the judges issued a further investigation, with a two-month deadline. In a response to the ruling emailed to CNN, Frances environment ministry conceded that the first objectives set over this past period have indeed not been achieved, but said a new Climate and Resilience bill will be presented to the Council of Ministers on February 10 and will constitute a decisive new step by accelerating Frances ecological transition. Currently, the world is set to warm by 2.7 degrees Celsius (4.86 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century, according to the Climate Action Tracker (CAT)  a non-profit analysis group which tracks government climate action. This will bring more extreme storms, heatwaves, greater sea level rise, and, for many parts of the world, worse droughts and rainfall extremes. In 2019, the UN warned that to hold global warming below the 1.5 degree Celsius threshold, global emissions would need to fall by 7.6% each year from 2020 to 2030. Global average temperatures have continued to climb. The last six years were the hottest six ever recorded, with 2020 joining 2016 as the hottest year.",04/02/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/04/europe/paris-climate-inaction-court-intl-scli/index.html
Climate change is making pollen season ?and your allergies ?worse,"Allergies arent just a sneezy seasonal annoyance. Hay fever has major health and economic consequences. It exacerbates asthma and weakens defenses against respiratory viruses, resulting in more emergency room visits and disrupted schooling and work. Climate change has already made pollen seasons in the United States and Canada worse, a new study of almost three decades worth of data has revealed. The pollen seasons are getting longer and more intense. The amount of time people in North America are exposed to pollen as well as the amount of pollen had increased significantly in recent decades, according to the authors. The researchers looked at different pollen metrics between 1990 and 2018 from 60 monitoring stations across North America. Pollen seasons were starting up to 20 days earlier and lasting for up to eight days longer, the scientists found. There was also an increase in the pollen count or concentration of pollen, with a rise of 20.9% between 1990 and 2018  and a 21.5% increase for the spring season alone. Theres an enormous body of research on how climate change is already affecting our health. Our study fills in a key piece connecting climate change to pollen, which is one of the largest drivers of asthma, allergies, and respiratory health problems, said William Anderegg, an assistant professor of biology at The University of Utah and lead author of the study that published in the journal PNAS on Monday. Its a clear example that climate change is here and now. The largest and most consistent increases were in Texas and the midwestern United States, the study found  something that surprised Anderegg. He had expected to see larger pollen increase in more northern states. He said the reason for this wasnt entirely clear and is going to take more research to unravel. One hypothesis might be that the plant species that are found there are particularly sensitive to warming and producing more pollen. The study looked at different drivers for this change, including temperatures changes, rainfall, frost days and carbon dioxide concentrations, and it found that an increase in mean annual temperatures was the strongest driver. Using computer models of the Earths climate, the researchers also calculated to what extent human-caused climate change had increased pollen concentrations and made pollen seasons longer. These computer models simulate a world without human-caused climate change and a world with human-caused climate change (i.e. the real world), Anderegg said via email. By combining the observed connection between pollen and temperature with these two different scenarios, we can estimate how much human-caused climate change is influencing pollen trends. The researchers concluded that it was a strong driver in terms of the earlier starts to the pollen season and longer season lengths. However, it was a more modest driver when it came to higher pollen concentrations. The contribution of human-made climate change was starker during the period 2003 to 2018 compared to the longer period of 1990 to 2018, the scientists said, which likely reflects both the cumulative effect of climate change and a larger number of pollen monitoring stations during the shorter period. The researchers also noted that the human environmental impact was more modest when looking at figures for an entire year versus the spring season, with some decreases in summer pollen counts indicating that the life cycles of some plant species had shifted. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, some 19.2 million adults have been diagnosed with hay fever  an allergic reaction to pollen, a fine powder from plants that can come into contact with your eyes, nose, mouth and throat.",12/02/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/12/health/climate-change-allergies-wellness/index.html
Mysteries of massive holes forming in Siberian permafrost unlocked by scientists,"The massive crater appeared violently and explosively in the Siberian tundra last year  a powerful blowout of methane gas throwing ice and rock hundreds of feet away and leaving a gaping circular scar in the empty and eerie landscape. It was the 17th hole to appear in the remote Yamal and Gyda peninsulas in the Russian Arctic since the first was spotted in 2013, mystifying scientists. The craters are thought to be linked to climate change. Drone photography, 3D modeling and artificial intelligence are helping to reveal their secrets. The new crater is uniquely well preserved, as surface water hadnt yet accumulated in the crater when we surveyed it, which allowed us to study a fresh crater, untouched by degradation, said Evgeny Chuvilin, lead research scientist at the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technologys Center for Hydrocarbon Recovery in Moscow. It was also the first time researchers have been able to fly a drone deep into a crater  reaching 10 to 15 meters below ground, allowing them to capture the shape of the underground cavity where methane had built up. Chuvilin was part of a team of Russian scientists who visited the crater in August 2020. Their findings were published in the journal Geosciences last week. The drone took around 80 images, allowing the researchers to build a 3D model of the crater, which is 30 meters deep  imagine three buses end to end. Study author Igor Bogoyavlensky, of the Oil and Gas Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, served as the drone pilot and said he had to lie down on the edge of the 10-story deep crater and dangle his arms over the edge to control the drone. Three times we got close to losing it, but succeeded in getting the data for the 3D model, he said. The model, which showed unusual grottoes or caverns in the lower part of the crater, largely confirmed what scientists had hypothesized: Methane gas builds in a cavity in the ice, causing a mound to appear at ground level. The mound grows in size before blowing out ice and other debris in an explosion and leaving behind the massive crater. Whats still unclear is the source of the methane. It could come from deep layers within the Earth or closer to the surface  or a combination of the two. Permafrost is a huge natural reservoir of methane, a potent greenhouse gas much more effective than carbon dioxide at trapping heat and warming the planet. Warmer summers  the Arctic is warming two times faster than the global average  have weakened the permafrost layer, which acts as a cap, making it easier for gas to escape. Some experts estimate that soils in the permafrost region hold twice as much carbon as the atmosphere does, making the region extremely important in the fight against climate change. Climate change, of course, has an impact on the probability of gas blowout craters appearing in the Arctic permafrost, Chuvilin said. With the use of satellite imagery, the researchers were also able to pinpoint when the crater formed. They believe the mound would have exploded at some point between May 15 and June 9, 2020. The crater was first spotted during a helicopter flight on July 16, 2020. The timing was not random, according to Chuvilin. This is the time of the year when theres a lot of solar energy influx, which causes the snow to melt and the upper layers of the ground to heat up, and that causes changes in their properties and behavior. While these craters have appeared in a very sparsely populated region, they do pose risks to Indigenous people and to oil and gas infrastructure. The holes are usually found by accident during helicopter flights or by reindeer herders. While 17 craters have been documented so far, its not known how many there are in total or when the next one could blow out. Scientists dont yet have good tools for detecting and mapping the gas emission craters, although a team at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Massachusetts is trying to change that. To log changes in the Arctic landscape, and perhaps ultimately predict where the next blowout crater might occur, the researchers have devised an algorithm to quantify changes to features such as the height of mounds and the expansion or shrinking of lakes on the Yamal and Gyda peninsulas. The scientists model correctly predicted all seven craters that had been reported by scientists by 2017 and revealed the formation of three new ones. The researchers also found that the craters are just one unsettling sign that the northernmost reaches of our planet are undergoing radical changes. Some 5% of the 327,000 square kilometers the team surveyed saw abrupt changes in landscape between 1984 and 2017. These changes included ground collapses, the formation of new lakes and disappearance of others, plus the erosion of river bends, according to the research, which published in the Geosciences journal in January. These craters represent a ... process that was previously unknown to scientists, said Sue Natali, Arctic program director at the Woodwell Climate Research Center and coauthor of the study, in a statement. The craters and other abrupt changes occurring across the Arctic landscape are indicative of a rapidly warming and thawing Arctic, which can have severe consequences for Arctic residents and globally.",17/02/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/17/world/siberia-craters-arctic-climate-change-scn/index.html
"Norway, the UK and Canada are not climate champions. They are climate hypocrites","In Oslo, the street lamps are powered by renewables. To conserve energy, the smart lights dim when nobody is around. The Norwegian capital, like the rest of the country, is proud of its exceptional green credentials. Its public transportation system too is powered entirely by renewable energy. Two thirds of new cars sold in the city are electric. Theres even a highway for bees. Theres just one problem. Much of the environmental innovation that Norway is so proud of is financed by its oil money. Because Norway, apart from being a forward-thinking climate champion, is also a major fossil fuels exporter. And it plans to keep it that way for a long time to come. Norway isnt the only country preaching sustainability while simultaneously cashing in on the very thing that is causing climate change. The UK is hosting a major climate summit later this year. At the same time, it is contemplating opening a new coal mine. Canada, a self-proclaimed climate leader, is pouring tax dollars into a doomed oil pipeline project. Many countries produce fossil fuels despite committing to combat climate change. But Canada, Norway and the UK stand out because they are doing that while positioning themselves as climate champions. The UK is leading the world in the fight against climate change, a spokesperson from the UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, told CNN in an email. We were the first major economy to legislate for net zero emissions by 2050, and have cut emissions by 43% since 1990  the best in the G7. The UK government can make these claims, because under international agreements, each country is only responsible for greenhouse gas emissions produced within its territory. That means the UK, Canada, Norway and others dont need to worry about the emissions caused by the burning of their oil, gas and coal in other places around the world. Burning fossil fuels emits CO2, which traps solar radiation in the atmosphere, just like glass traps heat in a greenhouse. This causes temperatures to rise, which in turn drives more extreme weather, ice melt and sea level rise. Its a simple equation: The more fossil fuels we burn, the more CO2 is released into the atmosphere and the larger the greenhouse effect. The goal of the Paris Climate Accord is to limit warming to below 2 degrees Celsius and as close as possible to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. To achieve that, the world needs to cut fossil fuel production by roughly 6% per year between 2020 and 2030. Yet current projections show an annual increase of 2%. We just cant afford to burn the majority of existing fossil fuel reserves in order to stay below 1.5 degrees Celsius, said Ploy Achakulwisut, a scientist at the Stockholm Environment Institute. Interactive: The pandemic gave the world an opportunity to fix the climate crisis Climate scientists have estimated the amount of greenhouse gases we can still add to the atmosphere without breaching the critical threshold of 1.5 degrees. At the start of 2018, the UNs Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimated this so-called carbon budget to be around 420 gigatons (billion tons) of CO2 for a two-in-three chance of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees. A more recent estimate published in the journal Nature earlier this year puts the figure at a range from 230 gigatons for a two-in-three chance of meeting the target to 670 gigatons for a two-in-three chance of missing it. The world produced roughly 34 gigatons of CO2 last year, which means the remaining carbon budget could last for just over six years, unless emissions start declining fast. Canada, the UK and Norway have all set ambitious targets. The UK and Canada pledged to reduce their territorial emissions to net zero by 2050. Norway wants to be carbon neutral by 2030. The net zero means that if they cant eliminate all emissions completely, they can make up for the difference by removing carbon from the atmosphere, for example by planting more trees. Professor Niklas Hohne, founding partner at the NewClimate Institute, a climate think tank, told CNN the decision to focus on territorial emissions goes back to the early days of climate negotiations. There was a long discussion on whether to do it this way and this agreement was reached and its not covering the issue of exports, or the issues of consumption of goods that are produced elsewhere ... and I agree, it doesnt 100% make sense, he said. It makes a huge difference. Norways annual domestic emissions reached around 53 million tons in 2017, according to its statistical office. The emissions from the oil and gas Norway sold abroad reached roughly 470 million tons in 2017, according to the UN Emission Gap Report. Norways minister of climate and environment, Sveinung Rotevatn, told CNN in a statement that the countrys commitments are based on territorial climate targets. Emissions related to the consumption of exported oil and gas products in other countries are covered by the importers emission accounts and targets, he said. Asked about the countrys oil and gas export plans, he said Norway strongly supports a transition from the use and production of fossil energy to renewable energy. Andrew Grant, the head of climate, energy and industry research at Carbon Tracker, a think tank, points out that that many producers rely economically on revenues from fossil fuels. They know the world will need to wean itself off them soon, but no one wants to be the first one to get out. Everyone has reasons why they think it should be them that continues producing and no one else, Grant told CNN. In the Middle East, its because its very low cost, in Canada, they talk about their human rights record, in Norway, they talk about the low carbon intensity of their production, in the UK, its because weve got mature fields of infrastructure ... in the USA, they were even saying theyre gonna export their molecules of freedom. Producing fossil fuels can be expensive and many governments argue that stopping now would be a waste of money, often public, already spent on existing projects and explorations. Hohne said the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline that runs from Russia to Germany is a good example. Its 95% done. And people now argue whether we should do it or not and theres a pressure to have it operating because people invested a lot of money into it. So now that its almost there, shouldnt we just build it and then use it? he said. I say no. This is not Paris-compatible, we need less fossil fuel infrastructure and not more. This is not necessary and its actually counterproductive. Canada, Norway and the UK all plan to keep producing fossil fuels, investing in new projects and explorations. According to Canada Energy Regulator, the countrys crude oil production is expected to keep increasing until 2039. Canadas proven oil reserves stand at roughly 168 billion barrels, according to government data. If all of that is extracted and burned, it would add an estimated 72 gigatons of CO2 into the atmosphere, based on a calculation using IPCCs figures for default carbon contents. Thats almost a third of the worlds remaining carbon budget. The Canadian government has not responded to repeated requests for comment. If Norway also continues to drill as planned, the total emissions from its known oil and gas reserves will amount to roughly 15 gigatons of CO2, according to CICERO, a Norwegian climate research institute. That would eat up 6.5% of the remaining carbon budget for the whole world. Meanwhile, the UK Oil and Gas Authority estimates that as of the end of 2019, UK petroleum reserves stood at 5.2 billion barrels, enough to continue production for two more decades. If that happens, subsequent combustion of these extracted fuels would add a further 2.2 gigatons of CO2 into the atmosphere. The UK as a whole produced 454 million tons of CO2 equivalent in 2019, the latest figures available. Its plan is to reduce this to 193 million million tons of CO2 annually by 2033. The numbers are estimates but they illustrate a major problem: National plans to cut emissions dont add up to the global total needed. Hohne said climate plans cannot stop at emission-cutting targets and should also set deadlines for phasing out internal combustion engines, reaching 100% renewables, and fossil fuels exit dates. So far, only a few small producers have stopped permitting new fossil fuel sites, Denmark was one in the last few months, and that kind of a decision needs to happen in Norway and Canada and the US and UK as well. While the current international agreements do not prevent countries from exporting fossil fuels emissions elsewhere, theres a new, powerful force that the governments need to think about: Voters. Public opinion has shifted in recent years, with climate protesters flooding the streets. When the UK government green-lit a plan to build its first deep coal mine in 30 years in Cumbria, northwest England, earlier this year, the decision sparked a wave of protests, including a 10-day hunger strike by two teenage activists. The mine was approved despite the UKs commitment to stop burning coal by 2025, because it would produce high-quality metallurgical coal used to make steel. Its a similar argument made by Australia and other coal producers: Coal is bad, but our coal is better. Thats one trend that you see across sectors that are going to be impacted by climate regulation, said Edward Collins, the director of corporate lobbying at InfluenceMap, a think tank studying climate lobbying. Its the Were special and though we support your climate ambition, this project, you know, we need this because of any number of reasons like jobs or the economy, and every single sector makes these claims, he added. The UK Climate Change Committee (CCC), an independent government advisory body, estimated the Cumbria mines operation and coal production would emit around 9 million tons of CO2 every single year, and noted that metallurgical coal too is scheduled to be phased out in the UK by 2035. James Hansen, one of the worlds leading climate scientists, has written a personal letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson urging him to reconsider the plan and telling him he risks being vilified and humiliated by young people if the mine goes ahead. The action forced Cumbria County Council, the local authority  which has previously approved the new mine three times  to make a U-turn earlier this month. It said it will now reassess the plan.",17/02/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/17/world/climate-hypocrites-uk-canada-norway-intl/index.html
The US is back in the Paris Agreement. Now what?,"America, welcome back to the frontline of the global fight against climate change. On Friday, President Joe Biden delivered on a key climate campaign pledge by re-joining the Paris Agreement  the international climate accord agreed in 2015 by world nations to tackle global warming. The US was a key player in helping to deliver the Paris Agreement, with former State Secretary and current US climate envoy John Kerry playing an instrumental role in this successful process. I have been extremely encouraged by the conversations I have had with Kerry and White House National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy  both formidable allies in the fight against climate change. The return of the US paves the way for climate action to run like a golden thread through US domestic and international policies  mirroring our approach in the United Kingdom as we prepare to welcome world leaders to the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP26, in Glasgow this November. Why does this all matter? The UN Climate Conference in Paris, the 21st such international gathering, was a turning point. It established a global consensus on the existential threat posed to our planet by climate change, and a shared international approach to address it. There has been progress on tackling climate change since 2015. Most recently, in December 2020, the UK, together with the UN and France, and in partnership with Italy and Chile, organized a climate ambition summit to mark the five-year anniversary of the Paris Agreement. Seventy-five world leaders came together to make further concrete pledges like emissions reduction targets to reach the goal of net zero emissions set in 2015. As I said at the end of that summit, we did make progress, but we have so far fallen short of what is required. In Paris, the international community agreed to limit warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, keeping a rise of 1.5 degrees in sight. But increasingly, scientific evidence suggests that we have already reached more than 1 degree of rise on pre-industrial levels, or those roughly prior to 1850. Much more remains to be done. The world is already experiencing the damaging effects of this steady rise in global temperatures. Last year was on par with 2016 as the hottest year on record, but it was set apart by the disasters fueled by climate change. It saw wildfires blaze across Australia, Europe and the US West Coast, and flooding and locusts destroy crops in East Africa. While just last month, Cyclone Ana hit Fiji, sending thousands fleeing to evacuation centers. As President of COP26, I have been engaging extensively with governments around the world, at summits and in meetings with individual leaders  most recently Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India  on the need for ambitious policies and commitments to deliver climate action. Through my work, I have witnessed the devastating impacts of climate change: melting glaciers, sea level rises, crop degradation, deforestation, and pollution choking some of the worlds greatest cities. All of this is taking a heavy toll on human health, the destruction of homes and livelihoods, and an alarming loss of biodiversity. Encouragingly in my conversations with governments and businesses, from tech to construction, there is a realization we just cannot go on as we are. We need to enact policies that deliver green growth  protecting our environment whilst creating jobs and economic prosperity. Whether this means a transition to clean energy with a resolute focus on renewable and clean energy sources, phasing out the sale of new combustion vehicles or reforestation programs and cleaning up environmentally degraded land. Green growth is absolutely possible. In the UK we managed to grow our economy by 75% while cutting our emissions by 43% over the past 30 years. And, along the way, we reduced the use of coal in our power mix from 40% almost a decade ago to less than 2% now. Enlightened business leaders will tell you that tackling climate change represents an unprecedented opportunity for investment and economic growth. The mantra of building back better, building back greener is very much on the money. I am delighted that President Biden has committed to joining the net zero club of economies such as the European Union, Japan, South Korea, China and the UK which have committed to reach net zero emissions or similar by a specified date. But what also matters are the near-term commitments countries make to reduce emissions by 2030 and demonstrate they are on the pathway to net zero. And I am very much looking forward to the US setting out its own 2030 target in the coming months. Developing nations, particularly those most vulnerable to the consequences of climate change, need financial support from developed countries to tackle its causes and effects  especially smaller island states like in the Pacific. Donor nations, through the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, must fulfill their pledges at Paris of making $100 billion a year available in international climate finance from 2020 onwards. And at Glasgow we will need to identify opportunities to go further. Tackling climate change is a shared endeavor. And the clock is ticking ever closer to the point of no return. And so, I look forward to working as a matter of urgency with President Bidens administration and governments around the world, to deliver decisive climate action on the road to and at Glasgow. We owe that to current and future generations.",19/02/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/19/opinions/us-paris-agreement-climate-change-sharma/index.html
"Flood risk is growing for US homeowners due to climate change. Current insurance rates greatly underestimate the threat, a new report finds","Wildfires and hurricane-force winds produce stunning videos and headlines, but flooding is the most common and costly natural disaster in the United States. And almost no place in the country is immune as 98% of all counties in the US have experienced at least one flooding event. In the last decade alone, floods have caused more than $155 billion worth of damage, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). As the climate changes, the risk of financial loss from flooding for millions of homeowners is increasing. A new report finds that there is a growing gap between the financial threat homeowners face from flooding and the insurance rates some pay to cover that risk. Currently, there are nearly 4.3 million residential properties around the country with a substantial risk of financial loss due to flooding. The report defines substantial risk as carrying a 1% chance of flooding in any year. Some, but not all, of those homeowners have insurance through the federal governments National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which provides more than 90% of the flood insurance policies in the US. But the report finds that those homes face losses each year which dwarf the costs of their NFIP premiums. The average NFIP premium cost today for those properties is around $981, but their expected annual loses are $4,694 per property. If all of those property owners were to purchase flood insurance to protect against potential damage, premiums would need to increase by 4.5 times to cover the risk. The analysis was conducted by the First Street Foundation, a non-profit research and technology group that aims to shed light on the growing risk of flooding around the country due to climate change. The study only considered residential properties with between one and four units, but the authors say the actual financial risk from flooding around the country is likely far greater than the report captures. Our numbers are large ... but its not encompassing all properties that are inside the Special Flood Hazard Area, or many other residential properties like condos, apartment buildings and other larger buildings, said Matthew Eby, founder and executive director of the First Street Foundation. So if you take that and you extrapolate, there are actually a lot more buildings that have financial risk as well. A separate report from the foundation last year estimated that there are a total of 14.6 million properties around the country with substantial flood risk. The owners of around 5.9 million of those properties may be unaware of their flood risk because they are located outside of FEMAs Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA), and therefore arent required to buy flood insurance even if they hold a government-backed mortgage loan, the report found. Scientists are confident that climate change is fueling hurricanes capable of whipping up more dangerous storm surges, as well as increasing the odds of extreme rainfall events that can trigger inland flooding. Today, the 4.3 million homes with a 1% chance of flooding carry an expected annual loss of $20.8 billion due to flood damage, the foundations analysis found. However, within the life of a 30-year mortgage signed today, those losses are projected to balloon by 61% to nearly $32.2 billion per year by 2050 due to the effects of climate change. As massive storms like Hurricanes Katrina, Harvey and Sandy have hammered some of the countrys biggest coastal cities, the NFIPs bottom line has already taken a beating. Today, the program is saddled with more than $20.5 billion in debt, according to a recent Congressional Review Service Report. Thats after Congress canceled $16 billion of the NFIPs debt in 2017 to allow the program to pay claims to victims of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. With climate change and more development and more properties at risk, it just keeps going further in the hole, said Sandra Knight, a senior research engineer at the University of Marylands Center for Disaster Resilience and a former FEMA administrator. That tells you youre not collecting enough premiums, but the long-term game is to have zoning and building codes that minimize risk. You cant just depend on insurance. Experts and even FEMA officials have acknowledged for years that there are shortcomings with the NFIP as it is currently structured. Chief among those is the process of drawing FEMAs flood maps, which provide the basis for setting insurance rates for many policies under the NFIP. FEMA still has not completed flood maps for huge swaths of the US, said Michael Grimm, the acting deputy associate administrator of the Federal Insurance and Mitigation Administratio, while testifying before a House committee in February 2020 And though FEMA maps are required by Congress to be reassessed every five years, Grimm says it takes seven years on average to complete a new flood map, meaning that some maps may technically be out of date by the time theyre finished. Insurance rate setting under the NFIP has seen little change since the 1970s. The rates are set depending on which of three broad types of flood zones a property sits in: low to moderate risk, high risk or high risk coastal area. The type of property, the elevation of the building, the number of floors and whether it has a basement are also factored in. But experts say the use of these flood zones is an unsophisticated way to gauge risk that doesnt take into account key considerations, like the topography of the land where a property sits. FEMAs flood models only factor in the risk of storm surge and river flooding, not the threat posed by heavy rainfall. Its actually sort of a crude way to price flood risk because it doesnt account for changing flood risk across a landscape, said Carolyn Kousky, the executive director of the Wharton Risk Center at the University of Pennsylvania and a member of the advisory board for the First Street Foundation. To address these problems, FEMA is expected to roll out a new system for setting flood insurance rates later this year called Risk Rating 2.0, which the agency says will utilize the latest technology to better capture the risk for each individual property. David Maurstad, the senior executive of the National Flood Insurance Program, said that the First Street Foundations findings should not be taken as a preview of the rate changes flood insurance policy holders can expect when Risk Rating 2.0 goes into effect. Any attempt to compare an outside entitys premium estimates or premium recommendations to the Risk Rating 2.0 initiative is premature, Maurstad said in an emailed statement. FEMA is constantly working to leverage new technologies and provide national-scale flood risk information more efficiently, accurately and consistently to the public. Still, Kousky says that the new findings are an important indicator of just how much the cost of flood damage could grow around the country as the climate changes, which the cost of insurance in any single year does not capture. It certainly has shown how much flood losses are going to start increasing as a result of climate change, she said. That should be a red flag for the NFIP and communities everywhere that the cost of this risk are going up. And that means to stay solvent, insurance costs have to go up as well.",22/02/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/22/business/flood-insurance-climate-change-risk-first-street-foundation/index.html
"New climate pledges ?ar short?of meeting Paris Agreement goals, UN warns","The planet is on red alert because governments are failing to meet their climate change goals, the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Friday. He described 2021 as a make or break year following the release of a UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) report analyzing the updated climate action plans submitted by 75 nations ahead of Novembers COP26 climate summit which found that current policies wont come close to meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement. Todays interim report from the UNFCCC is a red alert for our planet. It shows governments are nowhere close to the level of ambition needed to limit climate change to 1.5 degrees and meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, said Guterres in a statement. Under the 2015 Paris climate accord, countries committed to reduce their carbon output and halt global warming below 2 degrees Celsius  and if possible, below 1.5 degrees Celsius  by the end of the century to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Experts have repeatedly warned that exceeding the threshold will contribute to more heatwaves and hot summers, greater sea level rise, worse droughts and rainfall extremes, wildfires, floods and food shortages for millions of people. According to the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the population must reduce its 2030 CO2 emissions by about 45% from 2010 levels and reach net zero by 2050 to ensure this temperature limit goal is reached. Despite increased efforts, the carbon reduction plans submitted to the UNFCCC fall far short of what is needed and show countries need to strengthen their mitigation commitments under the Paris Agreement, according to the report. It shows that the revised climate action plans  which cover 40% of countries party to the 2015 Paris Agreement that account for 30% of global emissions  would only deliver a combined emissions reduction of 0.5% from 2010 levels by 2030. Guterres called on major emitters to increase efforts to reduce emissions and use the Covid-19 pandemic recovery as a chance to build back greener and better. Decision makers must walk the talk. Long-term commitments must be matched by immediate actions to launch the decade of transformation that people and planet so desperately need, Guterres added. The report is a snapshot, not a full picture of the individual country plans  called Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) by the UN  because of difficulties posed by the pandemic, said the UNFCCC executive secretary, Patricia Espinosa Friday. The UNFCCC will release a second report before COP26, and Espinosa urged all remaining emitters to contribute. ...its time for all remaining Parties to step up, fulfil what they promised to do and submit their NDCs as soon as possible, Espinosa said. If this task was urgent before, its crucial now.",27/02/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/27/world/un-climate-report-red-alert-intl/index.html
The slowing down of ocean currents could have a devastating effect on our climate,"Remember the movie, The Day After Tomorrow, in which a catastrophic series of global disasters strike after climate change causes the worlds ocean currents to stop? Well, new research reveals Earths major ocean currents are slowing down, and though the consequences will not be as immediate or dramatic as in the Hollywood fiction, there are real-world impacts for global weather patterns and sea levels. The slowdown of ocean circulation is directly caused by warming global temperatures and has been predicted by climate scientists. This has been predicted, basically, for decades that this circulation would weaken in response to global warming. And now we have the strongest evidence that this is already happening, said Stefan Rahmstorf of Potsdam University who contributed to this research. The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) transports water across the planets oceans, including the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian. The region contributing to the slowdown is the North Atlantic, according to the research. The idea (of this film), which is actually correct, is that if this Atlantic overturning circulation breaks down all together, this will lead to a strong cooling around the northern Atlantic, especially into Europe, into the kind of coastal areas (of) Britain and Scandinavia. But thats only true if the overturning breaks down all together, Rahmstorf said. In this part of the ocean, the Greenland ice sheets are melting, contributing to both a rise in sea levels and serving to reduce the speed of the circulation. This indicates that the slowdown is likely not a natural change but the result of human influence. The AMOC has a profound influence on global climate, and particularly in North America and Europe, so this evidence of an ongoing weakening of the circulation is critical new evidence for the interpretation of future projections of regional and global climate, said Andrew Meijers, deputy science leader of polar oceans at British Antarctic Survey. Ice melting in Greenland and the heavy rainfall over the North Atlantic induced by climate change has affected the salinity and density of the waters, Rahmstorf explained. Both surface warming and the increased water cycle, increased rainfall and the ice melt are all a consequence of global warming across parts of the North Atlantic Ocean, he said. As warm water currents move north, they typically turn back south as it gets cooler and heavier. Added freshwater from the melting ice is causing this turn to be slower because of reduced salinity. This weakening also leads to cold in the northern Atlantic, but its confined to the ocean. This cold blob, as we call it, is over the ocean, and it doesnt touch on land areas, said Rahmstorf. Current estimates show this weakening is moderate, at about 15% weaker compared to normal and based on data analyzed up from to 1,600 years ago. One of the main impacts of the slowing ocean circulation is on sea levels, especially those of the US East Coast. The northward surface flow of the AMOC leads to a deflection of water masses to the right, away from the US East Coast. This is due to Earths rotation that diverts moving objects such as currents to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. As the current slows down, this effect weakens and more water can pile up at the US East Coast, leading to an enhanced sea-level rise, said Levke Caesar, one of the authors of the report. Sea-level rise is already happening due to factors like melting ice sheets and warming oceans. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), water levels have risen by 8 to 9 inches on average within the past 140 years. The rate at which these waters are rising has also increased in recent years. The pace of global sea-level rise more than doubled from 1.4 mm per year throughout most of the twentieth century to 3.6 mm per year from 2006-2015, said NOAA. A further slowdown of global ocean circulation, especially along the crucial Gulf Stream current off the eastern coastline of the US, could combine with the already accelerating sea-level rise to make major Northeastern cities even more vulnerable to flooding. Global weather patterns are critically linked with the ocean circulations and their transport of heat and nutrients around the planet. An increase in heat waves across Europe and stronger hurricanes closer to the US coastline because of warmer water drifting closer to the coast can be linked to the ocean circulation, Rahmstorf said. The worlds seven warmest years have all occurred since 2014, with 10 of the warmest years occurring since 2005, said NOAA. Heat waves are becoming more frequent already. The ocean and the currents also play a role in absorbing carbon dioxide, the most dominant greenhouse gas, from the atmosphere. The changing currents could decrease the amount of carbon being taken out of the atmosphere, according to NASA. In addition to people being affected, the marine biology population is also at risk. Marine organisms very strongly depend on these ocean currents, which basically set the conditions for the whole ecosystem in terms of nutrient supply, temperature, and salinity conditions, Rahmstorf said. When asked whether the AMOC could slow down further or even stop, Rahmstorf said climate models suggest currents will slow down to between 34% and 45% by 2100. Despite a lot of research over the last decade on this, its very hard to pin down quantitatively, how far away is this tipping point. But the kind of model simulations that I know suggest that if you weaken this circulation by roughly half, youre getting into a critical state. And so this could well ... happen by the end of the century, Rahmstorf said. We should (strive to) stay well clear of that tipping point because the consequences if the circulation would break down all together would be really dramatic. Hollywood has shown us this potential worst-case scenario from climate change. And while the consequences shown in The Day After Tomorrow are very unlikely, they do illustrate how runaway impacts from climate change could result if we do not listen to the warnings coming from climate scientists.",02/03/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/03/02/world/climate-change-ocean-currents-weakening/index.html
Fighting climate change is now a job for the Bank of England,"Central banks are usually tasked with keeping inflation in check, while promoting economic growth and employment. Now, add fighting the climate crisis to the list. On Wednesday, the Bank of England was given a new mandate to support the UK governments ambition to become a net zero economy by 2050. I am today updating the [Monetary Policy Committees] remit to reflect the governments economic strategy for achieving strong, sustainable and balanced growth that is also environmentally sustainable and consistent with the transition to a net zero economy, finance minister Rishi Sunak wrote in a letter to Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey. The central bank  which has viewed climate change as a risk to financial stability for some time  will now take into account the climate record of companies before buying their bonds, effectively rewarding greener businesses by lowering their borrowing costs. It said in a statement that it will provide more information on its planned approach in the coming months. The change comes as UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson touts a green industrial revolution, following the coronavirus pandemic that triggered Britains worst economic slump in more than three centuries. Johnsons plan will funnel billions of pounds towards greening Britains power, transport and housing infrastructure. In a separate letter to Bailey on Wednesday, Sunak said that the central bank should continue to act with a view to building the resilience of the UK financial system to the risks from climate change and support the governments ambition of a greener industry, using innovation and finance to protect our environment and tackle climate change. Sunak unveiled plans in his annual budget to issue at least 15 billion ($20.9 billion) worth of green bonds in the coming year to help finance projects that tackle climate change and create jobs in the green economy. He also announced funds for new port infrastructure to support offshore wind farms and plans to launch a bond that will make it easier for UK savers to invest in green projects. Alongside these measures, Sunak unveiled Britains first infrastructure bank, which will be located in Leeds with the aim of channeling 40 billion ($55.8 billion) into projects such as carbon capture, hydrogen production and electric vehicle charge points. Former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said in a tweet that Sunaks decision to align the central banks remit with the transition to a net zero economy was a critically important move. But Keir Starmer, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, said the measures didnt go far enough. [Sunak] just talked up his green credentials, but his budget stops way short of what was needed or whats happening in other countries, he said in remarks to parliament. This budget should have included a major green stimulus, bringing forward billions of pounds of investments to create new jobs and new green infrastructure. The United Kingdom, which became the first major economy to commit to a legally binding target of net zero emissions by 2050, will host the COP26 UN climate change conference in Glasgow in November.

We can? plant or log our way out of climate change,"CNN published an opinion piece on Feb. 10 with the headline, Plant trees, sure. But to save the climate, we should also cut them down. This piece omitted some vital facts and science. While the piece did not call for a broad expansion of logging, I think its important for readers to understand these facts. Industrial logging and wood production are major drivers of climate disruption. The US is the worlds largest consumer and producer of wood products, according to data from 2015. Due to the intensity of logging, the rate and scale of forest destruction in the Southeastern US is estimated to be four times that of South American rainforests. When a forest is logged, carbon that would otherwise have been stored in the forest is emitted. Wood does store carbon even after it is chopped down, but much of that is lost into the atmosphere in the manufacturing process, when wood is used as building material, chopped into plywood, or turned into wood pellets; more is lost when wood is burned as fuel. Logging is the largest source of carbon emissions from US forests, according to research published in 2016, with the largest amounts coming from the Southeastern US. Yet, there is a concerted effort to distract the public from this fact and focus attention instead on planting trees and expanding our consumption of wood as a natural climate solution. First of all, planting trees is a poor substitute for protecting existing forests when it comes to solving the climate crisis. Natural forests are best at soaking up carbon from the atmosphere and the older a forest, the more carbon it can absorb and store, if left standing. Think about it. It takes decades for a forest to grow. All that time it is transferring carbon from the atmosphere to the land. When a forest is cut, it releases carbon that took decades to absorb, at a time when we need to keep carbon out of the atmosphere. Second, the science shows that the older a tree gets, the more carbon it can absorb and store. Its like slowly turning up the speed on a vacuum cleaner. That means that we need to not only protect the old forests but also allow the young forests to grow old. It also means that protecting forests that are already established is one of the most effective strategies when it comes to climate change. Third, we all support the re-establishment of forests on lands where there are none currently, but that is a long-term strategy and we need short-term solutions that address the current climate emergency. We only have about eight years to turn things around, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It is much more effective to protect a natural forest that already exists than to plant a new one. It takes decades, if not up to a century for a forest ecosystem to evolve and time is not on our side when it comes to avoiding climate chaos. Some scientists have warned that tree planting is not nearly as important as protecting existing natural forests. In addition, a forest is more than just trees. Its shrubs, ground cover, a myriad of native plants, microorganisms, fungi and animals. Monoculture commercial tree plantations are not forests. They are carbon and biodiversity deserts. Tree planting efforts that create monocultures will be establishing carbon and biodiversity deserts. That means a lot of time and money spent on a feel-good solution that doesnt actually solve the problem. Scaling up the protection of our nations forests from logging is as vital to solving the climate crisis as phasing out fossil fuels. Protecting existing natural forests is also the best strategy for shoring up natural flood control, and ensuring stable supplies of clean drinking water and protecting biodiversity. As we begin to experience increasing impacts of extreme weather linked to climate change, standing natural forests are our communities best natural defense.",05/03/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/03/05/opinions/trees-climate-logging-danna-smith/index.html
"Redlined US homes face higher flood risks from climate change, new study finds","Americans of color who were once forced to purchase houses in less-desirable neighborhoods are now in greater danger of losing their homes to flooding caused by climate change, according to a new study. During the early 20th century, US consumer banks routinely engaged in a systemic lending practice known as redlining, which denied loans to people of color seeking to purchase houses outside areas of cities deemed undesirable, in part, because they were built on areas with higher flood risk. Today, as a result, homes worth a combined $107 billion are now 25% more likely to be flooded than non-redlined homes, according to researchers from the real estate brokerage firm Redfin. The firm released the findings from its analysis of redlined and non-redlined communities facing climate change-related flood risks Monday morning. The report, which examined flood plain data from 38 major US metropolitan areas, noted that modern US flood-risk maps look a lot like redlining maps from the 1930s. In recent years, sea-level rise caused by climate change has increased the number of flood-risk areas across the nation. Some of these places are already having to deal with floods annually. Black homeowners in Chicago, for example, have complained about increased rainfall fueled by climate change overwhelming the citys sewer system and causing flood damage to homes that didnt have the same flooding issues a decade ago, according to the Chicago Tribune. The discrimination that happened in the past may seem like it happened a long time ago, but it compounds, Redfin chief economist Daryl Fairweather told CNN Business. Its not like the historical practices that were discriminatory diminished in effect. It seems like they actually increase in effect. Redfins researchers determined areas in the cities they examined that were not redlined were at risk of having $85 billion worth of homes damaged or destroyed by climate change-related flooding  $22 billion less than neighborhoods that were redlined. In their report, the firms researchers said more than 58% of households in neighborhoods that were once designated undesirable for mortgage lending are non-white and history has shown that when storms hit, communities of color in these formerly redlined areas often suffer the most. [More than] 600,000 properties faced 100-year flood risk, which is risk of one of these really catastrophic floods hitting them, Fairweather said. Fairweather noted the disproportionate impact Hurricane Katrina had on people of color in New Orleans in 2005 and Hurricane Harvey had on Black and Brown Houston residents in 2017 to illustrate her point. Four of the seven zip codes that suffered the worst flood damage from Katrina had Black populations of at least 75%, according to government records cited by Scientific American. A 2017 Think Progress analysis found disproportionately Black and Brown low-income Houston neighborhoods were more damaged by Harvey than wealthier and Whiter communities. Without public and private intervention, Fairweather said the damage future flooding may cause to redlined areas across the nation could further expand the already enormous racial wealth gap that exists between most White Americans and their Black and Latino neighbors. It would set us back for sure, Fairweather said. It really does depend on what the policy response is. To help solve the problem, the study authors recommend the federal government provide funds for some redlined homeowners to weather proof their homes and offer relocation assistance to homeowners in areas where weather proofing might not be enough. When we do provide assistance for people to move, we should encourage them or insist they move to places that wont be as affected by climate change, Fairweather said.",15/03/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/03/15/business/redlined-homes-climate-change-flooding/index.html
EPA relaunches climate change website previously modified by Trump administration,"The Environmental Protection Agency announced Thursday it has relaunched its climate change website as part of the Biden administrations efforts to tackle the climate crisis. The digital reboot marks a shift from the Trump administrations approach, in which several changes were made to various EPA websites. In many cases, climate change language was stripped from them. At the time, the Trump administrations EPA said language was being updated to reflect the approach of new leadership. J.P. Freire, the EPAs former associate administrator for public affairs, said in April 2017 the agency wanted to eliminate confusion by removing outdated language first and making room to discuss how were protecting the environment and human health by partnering with states and working within the law. In Thursdays announcement, the EPA touted the revamped website as part of the Biden administrations commitment to action on climate change and restoring science. For the first time in four years, EPA now has a webpage to guide the public to a range of information, including greenhouse gas emissions data, climate change impacts, scientific reports, and existing climate programs within EPA and across the federal government, the agency announced. EPA Administrator Michael Regan also weighed in on the new website, saying in a statement: Climate facts are back on EPAs website where they should be. Considering the urgency of this crisis, its critical that Americans have access to information and resources so that we can all play a role in protecting our environment, our health, and vulnerable communities, he said. Trustworthy, science-based information is at the foundation of strong, achievable solutions. The environmental agency noted this is a first step towards relaunching the full website, and that additional information on climate data, scientific reports and government programs will be added in the weeks and months to come.",19/03/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/03/18/us/epa-climate-change-website-biden-administration/index.html
"By the end of the century, summer weather could last half a year (and that? not a good thing)","Summer weather could grow to half a year in length by the end of this century if no mitigation efforts are done on climate change, according to a new study. In about the past 60 years, summer has increased by 17 days on average across the globe. Summers are getting longer and hotter while winters shorter and warmer due to global warming, said Yuping Guan, lead author of the study. Sure, longer summers may sound great for a family vacation or enjoying the outdoors, but this extended season could significantly impact our health, the environment and agriculture. Heat waves could grow longer, mosquito-borne illnesses could become more widespread, allergy season from pollen could turn more severe and the growing season of crops will be longer. The study reveals that warming temperatures globally are making the hottest quarter of the year, known as summer, longer, and this is also affecting when all the seasons start. The onsets of spring and summer are advanced, while the onsets of autumn and winter are delayed, the study says. The study splits the four seasons into four percentiles, with any temperature above the 75th percentile of the 1952-2011 temperature average being recognized as summer. Climate computer models are then operated to reveal how these defined seasons change over time. Over the period of 1952-2011, the length of summer increased from 78 to 95 days and that of spring, autumn and winter decreased from 124 to 115, 87 to 82 and 76 to 73 days, respectively, the study states. Most regions across the Northern Hemisphere have been experiencing longer summers already, but in the Mediterranean region it is growing by more than eight days per 10 years since the 1950s. This may not sound like much, but over a longer time scale it becomes more significant. Global sea and land temperatures continue to rise relative to average, and the difference compared to average is also growing. The last time annual temperatures were below average globally was in the late 1970s, meaning that the last time it was cooler than normal was more than 40 years ago, according to data from NOAA. Climate change driven by emissions of Greenhouse gases is the main contributor to the warming temperatures. If nothing is done to mitigate these emissions to slow down the effects of climate change, then summer could evolve into lasting half a year by the end of this century, according to the study. Under the business-as-usual scenario, spring and summer will start about a month earlier than 2011 by the end of the century, autumn and winter start about half a month later, which result in nearly half a year of summer and less than two months of winter in 2100. Countries around the world are trying to take action, but the goals set in the Paris Climate Agreement are not being met. That includes efforts to curb emissions. Aside from the warming temperatures and shifting seasons, this does have implications on human life. That includes agriculture. Spring is the season when plants begin to grow across parts of the US. The plants bud when they experience the warmer temperatures at the start of the season. This time of year is also met with temperature variability, however, when one day may be warm while the next is cold. These temperature extremes are a common occurrence with climate change. Starting spring a month earlier could mean disastrous losses for crops. Earlier weeks and months in the transition seasons could result in more drastic cold snaps following spring bud openings. For monsoon areas, shifting seasons can alter the time of monsoons. This means that patterns of monsoon rains are changed as well. These kind of changes may not sync with crops growth, Guan told CNN. It could also limit the types of crops grown, encourage invasive species or weed growth, or increase demand for irrigation, the Environmental Protection Agency says. A longer growing season could also disrupt the function and structure of a regions ecosystems and could, for example, alter the range and types of animal species in the area. There are other types of plants, like ragweed, that produce pollen. With an extended period of warmer temperatures, that allows plants to produce pollen for a longer time and at higher quantities. The changing of the seasons will also affect wildfires and heat waves, likely increasing their occurrence. A hotter and longer summer will suffer more frequent and intensified high-temperature events  heatwaves and wildfires, said Congwen Zhu, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences who is unaffiliated with this study. Heat events are already the deadliest on average compared to other weather events, such as flooding or hurricanes, in the US, as stated by the National Weather Service. The report also references how mosquitos could be affected by the longer summers and the warmer temperatures at the higher latitudes. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, diseases carried by mosquitos, such as Dengue, could become more widespread in a warmer climate and the time period of the year when it spreads could become longer.",23/03/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/03/23/weather/climate-change-hotter-summers-trnd/index.html
Two big factors are making things worse at the border. But they?e not getting much attention,"The devastating storms struck more than 1,000 miles away from the US-Mexico border, wiping out homes, crops and jobs. Now, months later, some migrants hoping to start over in the United States say the hurricanes are a big reason behind their decision to head north. The house fell down all around us. Thank God my mom survived, a teenager from Guatemala tearfully told CNN as he took his first steps in the United States. You always dream about living in a house with your children. Now we have nothing, a Honduran mother said from a bus station in Brownsville, Texas, after crossing the border with her 6-year-old daughter. (Hurricane) Eta  plus the pandemic  left us with nothing, a Honduran father told CNN en Espanol shortly after US authorities deported him and his family to Reynosa, Mexico. These voices from the border are a reminder of two important contributors to this crisis that havent gotten much attention, even as political debate heats up: climate change and Covid-19. Powerful, back-to-back hurricanes in November exacted a heavy toll on a region already suffering from the economic devastation of the pandemic. Thats making the situation unfolding now at the US-Mexico border even more complicated. Heres how: Its a possibility political leaders in Central America and experts on climate migration began warning of as soon as Hurricane Eta and Hurricane Iota struck. Months ago, a Honduran doctor who spoke with CNN said there wasnt any doubt the storms were going to spur more migration. So much famine is coming because the last harvest was lost. There is no capacity to store anything. Prices were already skyrocketing. ... I dont want to think about whats going on through the minds of those who lost everything, nutrition specialist Dr. Maria Angelica Milla said in November. Prepare for the waves. Climate change itself is rarely the lone driving factor behind migration, says Kayly Ober, program manager of Refugees Internationals Climate Displacement Program. But in exacerbating existing issues, it can play into peoples decisions. In the case of Hurricanes Eta and Iota, yes, the pure intensity of the scale and impact was definitely impacted by climate change, she says. That wrought a level of destruction that was unheard of in some parts of the region. Flooding wiped entire communities off the map in Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala. Homes were destroyed. Millions of people were affected, and hundreds of thousands were displaced. Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane researcher at Colorado State University who monitors and analyzes hurricane trends around the globe, told CNN last year that the fact that water temperatures were warm enough to allow both storms to rapidly intensify so late in the hurricane season was a clear signal of global warming. Many migrants whove spoken with CNN over the past month have said the storms played a part in their decisions to flee. Theyve also mentioned other factors, like the hope that a new US presidential administration would be more welcoming. Families in the region were already surviving on the edge of a knife even before the storms, facing food shortages and pervasive violence, says Meghan Lopez, the International Rescue Committees regional vice president for Latin America. The hurricanes were...the last in the series of what was a devastating year, she says, noting that the storms were one part of a complicated mix of factors fueling migration. To have the pandemic on top of that, to have aid to the region cut, all of these things create this pressure cooker where theres no escape valve, Lopez says. And the only escape valve is to try to flee the terrible situation people are living in. ... People are making desperate decisions. Lopez says the pandemic, like the hurricanes that hit the region, made existing problems far worse. If people were already experiencing violence, they were then locked into their communities, locked into their homes with that violence, she says. Really Covid just exacerbated at ratcheted every single issue that people are facing in the region, and every single risk factor for migration in the region, up many, many notches. Another reason why, Ober says, is that coping strategies subsistence farmers would use to get through economic hardship were no longer an option once the pandemic hit. For example, during prolonged and repeated droughts in the region known as the dry corridor, its common for farmers to temporarily move into cities for a season if their crops are struggling. With Covid-19, it was a double whammy, Ober says. If you moved to the city, there were lockdowns, and you werent able to access those economic opportunities anymore. It made it harder to overcome any kind of shocks. The pandemic pushed 22 million more people into poverty in Latin America last year, according to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean. Thats on top of the public health consequences, which have also been devastating. In addition to worsening economic conditions in Central America, the pandemic has also contributed to a big backlog at the US-Mexico border. Its playing a huge role, says Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. A growing number of unaccompanied minors are being held in facilities longer than the 72-hour legal limit because shelters run by the Department of Health and Human Services havent had enough space due to pandemic constraints on how many people they could house. The administration had limited HHS capabilities to shelter unaccompanied child migrants. They had decreased their bed space by 40%. Thousands of beds that normally would be available were offline, Pierce says. Even though those capacity rules were recently lifted and the shelters have been ramping up to hold more people, she says, the process has been slow. Another major complicating factor: the pandemic is ongoing  raising public health questions about the conditions in facilities where migrants are detained and how coronavirus testing is being conducted. There hasnt been a lot of transparency about the testing process. ... Its adding a layer of complexity to an already very challenging situation, Pierce says. And the government hasnt given the media access to the Customs and Border Protection facilities where many migrants are being held, so theres still a lot we dont know about whats happening behind closed doors.",24/03/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/03/24/us/border-climate-change-covid/index.html
"As people flee climate change on the coasts, this Midwest city is trying to become a safe haven","Tracy thought shed built her forever home. She and her 5-year-old granddaughter live in an energy-efficient house in Northern California that Tracy designed  by a pond thats frequented by otters, ducks and herons (oh my!). Then came the fires, the smoke, the evacuations, the days when the sky turned red and they were unable to see the sun. It was terrifying, she said. Understandably. And its poised to get worse because of the climate crisis, which is contributing to longer and more dangerous wildfires in the West as humans dump fossil fuel pollution into the atmosphere. Because of this, Tracy made the difficult decision to leave. Then came more questions that seemed even trickier. Where to go? Is anywhere safe from the climate emergency? She left CNN a voicemail about the conundrum. (She did that as part of an ongoing series of mine thats called Lets talk about the climate apocalypse.) The big question I have is: If not here, where? she said. Feeling a little bit like a climate journalist (which I am) and a little bit like an annoying HGTV host (which I am not  yet?), I went on a quest to try to answer that question for Tracy. I had a hunch that she wasnt alone in asking this question. The last several years have shown the degree to which human carbon emissions already are shaping reality: more-frequent wildfires raging in California, rapidly intensifying hurricanes pounding the Gulf of Mexico, sea levels rising on the Atlantic and droughts become more severe in the West. Im sure there are plenty Americans asking themselves if home will ever feel safe. Ive done pretty extensive reporting on climate-induced migration  including from Honduras, Puerto Rico or the Marshall Islands, where people tend to be thinking less about where they will move to and more about the climate disasters that are pushing them out. But I have to admit: I havent thought much about where people should go. Or about whos able to move and why. Tracy knows she is privileged to be able to plan this move and to have the resources to make it comfortably  to choose while others are forcibly displaced. Her house is still standing and in good shape. The fires came to a nearby ridge, but not to her pond or land. Rather than pretending the fire risks will recede, or waiting for a fire to come and force her out, she is facing harsh realities and trying to make what I would consider a wise decision  one that, for her, focuses on her granddaughters future. When this happens at the community level, climate adaptation specialists call it managed retreat. Without government programs to help people relocate out of harms way (there are very few, and theyre not scaled appropriately), climate migration will only widen gaping inequalities in this country. Some can choose to move. Others will be left to fend for themselves. Its the scattered, diffuse successor to the Dust Bowl in the 1930s, the Great Migration of Black Americans from the South in the 1900s and of White flight to the suburbs in the 1970s. And it usually happens with little discussion. In taking up Tracys question, I had my own. Were there other people like her? And if so, where were they moving? One of my first calls was to Jesse Keenan of Tulane University, who studies the movement of people and the ways were adapting to climate risks. In recent years, Keenan and other researchers, including A.R. Siders and Mathew Hauer, have been raising awareness about how the climate crisis will force people to move. The scale is far greater than most people realize. This is on the scale of the great Dust Bowl and the migration that came along with that, Keenan told me. There are too many unknowns to fully quantify the scope of climate-induced migration, he said, but we do recognize that this is in the order of millions of people. The World Bank, for example, estimates that more than 140 million people could become internally displaced by the climate crisis in coming decades  and their assessment only includes a few regions of the world. The rise in sea levels alone (which does not account for Tracys situation, fleeing fire or other climate calamities like floods) is expected to displace 13 million people in the US by 2100, according to Hauers research published in the journal Nature Climate Change. In this context, Keenan has become fascinated by the same question as Tracy  the where. Where will people move as the world continues to warm? And are there any places that would be smart to position themselves as a climate refuge? His answer: Yes. In particular, the Great Lakes region and the American Rust Belt. And in hyper-particular: Duluth, Minnesota. In 2019, after conducting a statistical analysis of US cities  including the cost of living, relative vulnerability to climate-related disasters and effects, availability of diverse housing stock, natural resource availability, and so on  Keenan began discussing Duluth, Minnesota, as one of the most climate-friendly places in the United States. Scientists and other academics from the University of Minnesota Duluth caught wind of this and asked Keenan to come to town to present his research in town. In a public lecture, Keenan introduced some tongue-in-cheek slogans  Duluth: not as cold as you think!  and outlined his vision for Duluth as a climate refuge. People in Duluth are still talking about the visit two years later. His thesis rests on a few key points: The entire Great Lakes region is poised to succeed in this way, Keenan told me. Thinking across decades and generations  not right away  that northern region could undergo a Renaissance as people flee fire, rising seas, floods, hurricanes and extreme drought. There are still climate risks in the upper Midwest, to be sure. But they are expected to be less intense than those affecting other parts of the United States. Lucinda Johnson, associate director of the Natural Resources Research Institute at the University of Minnesota Duluth, recalls thinking that this idea of refuge was the most natural thing in the world. She studies other organisms that seek it  and theyre usually looking for freshwater. Theres no reason to think that humans are going to be any different from other species when it comes to seeking out that resource, Johnson told me. We are part of the ecosystem, so theres not a lot we can do to separate ourselves from the natural world. I decided to follow in Keenans footsteps and take a trip to Duluth. After all, if I were going to recommend this place as a future home for Tracy  and all of the other people considering similar moves  I should at least set eyes on it. Duluth sounds fine on paper, but House Hunters teaches us that listings arent always what they seem. Im not going to sugarcoat my first impression: Driving into town, Duluth struck me as a Midwestern version of Pittsburgh. The city is about two hours north of Minneapolis by car. The first thing you see from that direction is its industry  a paper mill, factories, heaps of ore. Plus, the weather. In mid-March, after one brilliantly sunny afternoon, it was very windy and therefore fairly cold. (Im not going to say frigid even though it felt that way to me at times, coming from Salt Lake City; Minnesotans, who are known for being super nice, also are known for being super not-nice to people who complain about their weather.) In February, before my visit, the temperature dropped to minus 27 degrees Fahrenheit. Get a little closer, though, and Duluths allure begins to reveal itself. You can see the hillside that plunges with San Francisco-like steepness toward Lake Superior. And then, of course, theres the lake. Ive spent relatively little time in the Great Lakes region, but this is a lake that looks and sounds like an ocean. Signs alert visitors of its substantial currents. Theres a light house, a boardwalk and a lift bridge that crosses St. Louis Bay. Waves crash on the rocky shore of the lake  and, truly, you can forget for a moment that youre not on the Pacific. I felt conflicted right from the start. One of my first stops was to meet the citys mayor, Emily Larson. We are known as the San Francisco of the North, Larson said with smile. Ill let you decide if you think thats true. At first, Larson didnt know how to feel about Keenans proposal  Duluth as climate refuge. The idea really challenged me, actually, she told me, like, challenged me personally. She found it difficult to grapple with the fact that people are being forced from homes theyve built and have loved  that human-caused warming would undercut entire ways of life. Given that stark reality, though, she wants to help. Its a wonderful place to live. Its an extraordinary place, she said of Duluth. And we want to be that (refuge) for people. It happens to be a potential refuge where the average home price, according to Zillow, is just north of $200,000. Far short of San Franciscos $1.4 million. Not everyone shares this vision of Duluth-as-climate-refuge. There are fears in town that property values will go up  that the clean water, ample parks and relatively affordable housing may not survive thousands of new arrivals. The state and nations painful legacy of colonialism complicates matters further. I spoke with Karen Diver, a member of the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa and a former adviser to President Obama on Native American affairs, about this idea. For her, the stakes could not be higher. If you are going to come here, then you need to support us as Indigenous people so that your climate solution doesnt end up in our cultural and spiritual genocide, she said. This is treaty area for the Fond du Lac Band (of Lake Superior Chippewa). And, once again, we are going to bear the brunt of colonization, she said. These will be new colonizers coming to the area, but its going to because theyre going to come here for reasons that have nothing to do with anything that Tribal people have done. Diver said its not that she doesnt sympathize with people who are moving because of the climate crisis. Its that she wants to be sure their arrival doesnt further degrade the natural resources that make northern Minnesota special  and that Indigenous people arent further marginalized (or further pushed off of their land) by new migrants. If youre coming for the clean water, can we still promise you clean water with 50,000 or 100,000 more people? she said. Dont kill the thing you love, you know? Larson, the mayor, told me the city is planning for sustainable growth. She said shes sensitive to Divers concerns and the fact that this land has been inhabited for centuries, well before Duluth existed as a town, should be front of mind during this potential transition. Largely, Duluth-as-climate-refuge is still a theory. But I did meet two people for whom this is reality. Jamie Beck Alexander and Doug Kouma both moved to Duluth, separately, in circumstances similar to Tracys. They lived in California and became fearful of wildfires and toxic air quality. They sought out Duluth in part because of its perceived insulation from climate disaster. Kouma, who was living in Sonoma County, created a spreadsheet with some of the qualities he was looking for in a new city. Duluth ranked near the top for him, particularly for its lack of climate risks and its relatively progressive politics. A visit in 2019 sealed the deal. Duluth is today is sort of maybe what San Francisco might have been 20 or 30 years ago? he told me, not 100% sure about this but also not willing to dismiss the comparison. Its crunchy. Its granola. You can be who you want to be and live the life you want to live here. As for the winters? Theyre super cold, he said. But people embrace it by cross-country skiing and snowshoeing. He actually didnt mind it. His biggest complaint seems to be the small size of the 40-something dating pool. He jokingly asked me to encourage dating prospects to check Duluth out. Jamie Alexander, meanwhile, left San Francisco with her husband and two young children last summer. They didnt want to live through another fire season  particularly because of their childrens health. Our home didnt feel habitable to us anymore, she said. They started driving east and kept going until they felt like they were a safe distance from fire risk. That ended up being Minnesota, and eventually Duluth. Alexander is the director of Drawdown Labs at Project Drawdown, which is a climate-focused organization, so she was familiar with the risks. They couldnt be more pleased with Duluth. Alexander told me she feels more at home here after several months than shed felt in other locations the family had lived in for years. Weve been really warmly welcomed, she said. Given the similarities between Alexanders story and Tracys, I asked Alexander if she had anything she wanted to say to the woman struggling with the question of where to move. I would say, Were all in this unknown together. I dont think there are some people who have the answers and other people who are searching for them. I think were all, you know  were all searching and were all trying to make sense of whats happening to the planet. Theres no guidebook for this, she added. History is no guide for the future. After the trip, I called Tracy. I wasnt trying to convince her to move to Duluth, per se. This isnt actually HGTV. I share Mayor Larsons sentiment that none of this feels good. There are terrible inequities baked into the way climate migration is unfolding in the United States. My true wish is that the world would stop burning fossil fuels, which would slow down the rate of warming thats driving these changes. Short of that, its logical to me that Americans like Tracy would seek to adapt. If only this country could help lower-income people do the same. And if only the United States could become a global leader in a push to include the climate as a valid criterion for status under the Refugee Convention. Currently, climate migrants are not covered under international refugee law like political refugees, for example. I also want people like Tracy to find safety  to find home in this troubled world. I told her about Keenan and Duluth. About how it meets many of her personal criteria  the sense of community, the progressive politics, the availability of freshwater and (for the most part) the apparent reduced risk of wildfire. Ill go look! she said, partly just to placate me, I think. Maybe its closer to San Francisco than I realized. If so, that would be wonderful. Theres no easy or happy ending to this story. Tracy has decided to move. But she still doesnt know where. The idea of the Midwest doesnt appeal to her culturally, and shes worried about the cold winters. Maybe Vermont? New England? Nothing feels exactly right  or doesnt yet. Even Alexander, who is happy now in Duluth, told me this transition has been extraordinarily painful. She left San Francisco without really saying goodbye to a place she loved. I thought back on my conversation with Keenan, who told me that the United States is an extraordinarily mobile country. Were people who adapt to problems by moving  for better and worse. The climate crisis may prove to drive the Greatest Migration of them all. Its playing out today with relatively little notice. And with little support from governments or international organizations. Nowhere is truly safe. But perhaps its only human to seek whatever refuge you can find it.",12/04/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/12/opinions/climate-migration-in-america-california-duluth-sutter/index.html
"In the end, everything is about equity? How experts say the pandemic could invigorate climate change action","This enemy does not recognize geopolitical borders. It has the power to wreak havoc on national economies, to cost people their livelihoods and their lives. It seeps through the smallest cracks in our social fabric, targeting the poor and the vulnerable among us. Sound familiar? The Covid-19 pandemic and climate change have led to catastrophic fallout on a global scale, necessitating cross-border cooperation. Both also cause exponentially more harm to those of lower socioeconomic status. Experts say that the Covid-19 pandemic has been a stress test for regional and international collaboration that has strained political partnerships. But despite nationalistic self-interest surrounding supplies of vaccines and virus treatments, some experts say it may actually put us in a better position to earnestly and successfully combat climate change in a post-pandemic society  if we learn from our mistakes. The pandemic has given us a trial run, said Alice Hill, the David M. Rubenstein senior fellow for energy and the environment at the Council on Foreign Relations. But the big difference between pandemics and climate risk is that the climate has undergone permanent, irreversible damage. And so we need to focus on how we build resilience quickly and effectively on a global scale. Hills upcoming book, The Fight for Climate after COVID-19, explores the many lessons learned from the worlds failure, so far, to avert disastrous increases in global temperatures. She argues that despite the pain it has caused, the pandemic offers an immense learning opportunity, if only we are willing to take this lesson to heart: When it comes to global disasters, we need multilateral solutions that take everyone into account. This kind of concerted, cooperative effort Hill says we need to curb climate change was perhaps most noticeable in the scientific communitys race for a vaccine, a pursuit of normalcy that yielded results in record time. The challenge now is coordinating an equitable global distribution plan that takes into account that this pandemic will not end for anyone, until it ends for everyone, said Obiora C. Okafor, the United Nations independent expert on human rights and international solidarity. Okafor warned in January that the world faces a sharp and highly problematic vaccine-divide where a small number of richer countries have cornered the vast majority of available COVID-19 vaccines, leaving the bulk of the worlds population with almost no access to these medicines. This inequity is all too familiar to those who study the effects of climate change. As the climate crisis worsens, many groups  including poor communities and communities of color  are the most vulnerable to the dangers of a warming planet. We were caught unprepared by the virus, but weve also been caught unprepared by the natural disasters that have been exacerbated and caused by climate change, said Josh Apte, a professor of environmental science at the University of California-Berkeleys School of Public Health. And this is because, even in really prosperous societies, we havent attended to the equity infrastructure that we need in order to protect people. The pandemic has also preyed on underlying economic and health care disparities. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows that Black, Hispanic and Native American people that are infected with Covid-19 are far more likely to be hospitalized than other groups. The privilege that allows some to work from home and avoid contact with strangers is the same privilege that allows others to work in air-conditioned office buildings, while manual laborers suffer outdoors in dangerous temperatures. These conditions will only get worse and more erratic as climate change accelerates, says Apte, and those lower on the socioeconomic ladder will suffer the brunt of the consequences. COVID has been manageable for some people in society and totally unmanageable for others because many societies around the world dont have the safety net to help people when the bottom falls out. However, by bringing these systemic inequalities to the forefront of the public consciousness, experts say the pandemic could inspire us to see the world as truly interconnected. As a result, we may be able to design equitable programs and offer resources to combat the growing divide between rich and poor. All of our planning going forward needs to account for the increased risk for vulnerable populations, said Hill. Those who have the least means, those who have faced historic discrimination  they suffer the most. When it comes to the pandemic response, we have already seen seeds of equity beginning to sprout. The COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) program, an initiative led in part by UNICEF and the World Health Organization, is a coalition of wealthier nations and the European Union Commission whose aim is to increase access to Covid-19 vaccines in developing countries. As of April 12, the multilateral organization has shipped 38 million Covid-19 vaccines to 106 participant nations such as Ghana, Moldova, Belize, and Vietnam. There are also signs that the Biden administration is putting equity and environmental justice at the center of its plans to fight climate change. President Biden recently unveiled a sweeping infrastructure plan that would invest hundreds of billions of dollars into clean energy and climate change mitigation research. But the plan also seeks to reform foundational social systems that have suffered from both continual federal disinvestment and the pandemic. It includes investments that the administration says will improve access to affordable housing, clean water, and reduce air pollution, especially in communities of color and rural parts of the country. According to Hill, we must use this approach to avert the worst consequences of climate change globally. We need to help these countries deal with the impact of climate change, and make sure that they are able to turn to clean energy sources rather than dirty energy sources, she said. It is in our interest to help countries better prepare both for climate risks and to combat the virus, because we will suffer reverberations as a result of other governments being unable to handle the issues in their own countries.",13/04/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/13/world/climate-change-covid-19-lessons-equity/index.html

Google Earth? new Timelapse feature shows chilling effect of climate change,"Google Earth users can now see the striking effect of climate change over the past four decades. Googles latest feature, Timelapse, is an eye opening, technical feat that provides visual evidence of how the Earth has changed due to climate change and human behavior. The tool takes the platforms static imagery and turns it into a dynamic 4D experience, allowing users to click through timelapses that highlight melting ice caps, receding glaciers, massive urban growth and wildfires impact on agriculture. Timelapse compiles 24 million satellite photos taken from 1984 to 2020, an effort Google (GOOG) said took two million processing hours across thousands of machines in Google (GOOG) Cloud. For the project, the company worked with NASA, the United States Geological Surveys Landsat program  the worlds longest-running Earth observation program  the European Unions Copernicus program and its Sentinel satellites, and Carnegie Mellon Universitys CREATE Lab, which helped develop the technology behind Timelapse. To explore Timelapse in Google Earth, users can type any location into the search bar to see it in motion, whether its a landmark or the neighborhood in which they grew up. Google said it removed elements such as clouds and shadows from the images, and computed a single pixel for every location on Earth for every year since 1984; ultimatel stitching them together into a timelapse video. For example, its possible to see the Cape Cod coast slowly shifting south, agriculture growth in the middle of a desert in Al Jowf, Saudi Arabia, and the development of Songdo beach, a man-made beach in Busan, South Korea. Visual evidence can cut to the core of the debate in a way that words cannot and communicate complex issues to everyone, said Rebecca Moore, a director of Google Earth, in a blog post on Thursday. Google also created various guided tours through Voyager, its storytelling platform, around some of the broader changes seen in the imagery. The company said it hopes governments, researchers, journalists, teachers and advocates will analyze the imagery, identity trends and share their findings. We invite anyone to take Timelapse into their own hands and share it with others  whether youre marveling at changing coastlines, following the growth of megacities, or tracking deforestation, Moore said. Timelapse in Google Earth is about zooming out to assess the health and well-being of our only home, and is a tool that can educate and inspire action.",15/04/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/15/tech/google-earth-timelapse/index.html
Apple? $200 million fund aims to fight climate change and boost business,"Apple has announced a $200 million investment fund designed to remove carbon emissions from the atmosphere and support sustainable forestry  and to generate financial returns for the company. Called the Restore Fund, the effort aims to remove 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year, equivalent to the fuel used by more than 200,000 passenger cars annually. The project could also act as an important model for other corporations by demonstrating the ability to profit from investments in the environment. The idea of having a return is important for the planet, Apples vice president for Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives Lisa Jackson said in an interview with CNNs Christine Romans that aired Friday. Because if you really want businesses to engage, if you want business to really turn around and do this at scale ... it has to be because theres a return on that investment, Jackson said. Otherwise, its just philanthropy. And so much of what were doing at Apple is showing that the business of doing right by the planet is good business. The Restore Fund will generate returns by investing in developing and conserving sustainable working forests that both remove carbon from the atmosphere as they grow, and also produce trees for building materials, paper and other uses. Apples packaging, for example, has since 2017 been made entirely of virgin wood fiber from responsibly managed working forests  the same kinds it plans to invest in through the fund. Apple (AAPL) established the fund alongside Goldman Sachs (GS), which will manage it, and the nonprofit Conservation International, a co-investor that will ensure the projects it funds are subject to strict environmental and societal standards. Those are renewable products if the forest is grown in a way that its sustained, Jackson said. What were really saying with the Restore fund is: here is a way for us to invest in doing forestry the right way. That supports the planet, it supports returns and it supports communities, these people who work in the forestry industry. The Restore Fund builds on Apples previous commitments aimed at fighting climate change. Since 2018, the company has said its retail stores, data centers and corporate offices all run on 100% clean energy. The company is also changing the materials with which it builds products to more environmentally friendly options. And by 2030, Apple says it will make its global corporate footprint entirely carbon neutral, including its supply chain, manufacturing processes and products. All of those changes are being made, Jackson said, not just because the nearly $2.3 trillion corporation wants to give back to the earth, but also because theyre good for business. All of those things were done with an eye toward return, she said. The truth of the matter is that clean energy is cheaper, and cleaner. And so if we can show companies that this is good for business, then youre not having to choose between your bottom line and doing well by the planet. The news of Apples latest sustainability effort also comes at a time when many corporations are engaging on a number of other progressive topics, including voting rights and the prospect of raising corporate taxes. Executives from more than 100 companies, including fellow big tech giants Facebook (FB), Twitter (TWTR), Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN), issued a public statement earlier this month opposing any measures that deny eligible voters the right to cast ballots. The statement followed legislation in Georgia, Texas and other states where Republican lawmakers are trying to clamp down on ballot access. Apple was not among the statements signatories. But on Monday, Will Smith and Antoine Fuqua announced that production of their film Emancipation, which was sold to Apple Studios, would leave Georgia over the states restrictive voting law, a decision Jackson said the company supports. The right to be in a democracy is a sacred civil right ... we want to see every single person have the right to vote, Jackson said. Companies like ours, we stand for action on climate change. We also have taken a strong stand that there are still inequities, systemic injustices, that are tied to race around education and criminal justice and economic opportunity. And we want Apple to be a force to advance those causes and to finally end these inequities. Jackson deflected on the question of whether Apple supports raising corporate taxes, which has been posited as a way to help pay for the Biden Administrations ambitious infrastructure package and which has received support from leaders at Amazon (AMZN) and BlackRock. I think that the economy can find a way to make the investments that it needs, she said, adding, Im not going to speak to specifics at this point. However, she did say that the infrastructure plan, which would involve investment in high-tech manufacturing, clean energy and transportation systems designed for electric vehicles, would be good for the country and for Corporate America. Theres so many good ideas that are part of the technology and the economy we need for the future so we can stay the cutting edge country that weve always been, Jackson said. I do think that investments in infrastructure have always been seen as an investment in the future and quite good for business, so we need to come together as a country and figure that out.",16/04/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/16/tech/apple-lisa-jackson-sustainability-fund/index.html
The realities of climate change are pushing big businesses to focus on sustainability,"A consensus appears to be taking root in Corporate America: Whats good for the environment can also be good for business. As President Joe Biden prepares to bring 40 world leaders together for a two-day climate summit this week, big businesses have been amplifying their sustainability initiatives and making trillion-dollar pledges to fight climate change. Meanwhile, consumers are increasingly concerned about business carbon footprints, and companies are feeling the pressure and urgency to act. Ahead of Earth Day and Bidens climate summit, CNN Business rounded up the latest news from Corporate Americas environmental enlightenment. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) is putting serious firepower behind the fight against climage change. The bank on Thursday said it would finance or facilitate investments of $2.5 trillion over 10 years to support initiatives that focus on combating climate change and enhancing sustainable development. Some of the efforts will center around renewable energy, new clean technology, waste management and conservation. The announcement is the latest addition to a long list of environment-focused pledges from financial institutions, but its believed to be the largest of its kind by a major bank. A new Google Earth feature gives viewers a sobering look at how much climate change and human behavior have damaged the planet during the past four decades. The feature, called Timelapse, turns the platforms still images into a 4D experience. Clicking through reveals moving pictures of melting ice caps, receding glaciers, massive urban growth and devastation from wildfires from 1984 to today. Mastercard (MA) created a calculator that measures consumers carbon footprints based on what they purchase. The tool focuses on specific spending categories but doesnt track individual transactions. It also shares information about the number of trees that are required to absorb the same amount of carbon dioxide that is released from the consumers purchases in specific categories. In an effort to reduce waste, Nike (NKE) is asking customers to bring in sneakers that are gently worn or have manufacturing flaws. After cleaning and sanitizing the shoes, the company plans to resell them at select stores at a reduced price. Nike (NKE) said its currently selling the returned shoes in eight Nike (NKE) stores in the United States, and it plans to expand to 15 locations by the end of April and several more by the end of the year. Wells Fargo (CBEAX) announced its goal of hitting net-zero greenhouse gas emissions  including from the companies and projects it finances  by 2050. And while 2050 is far away, the announcement is a big step for Wells Fargo (CBEAX), which has long been a major backer of oil, natural gas and coal projects that climate activists warn threaten the planet. Volvo announced that by 2030, it will sell only electric cars, and only online. The company hopes to have electric cars make up half of its sales in 2025, and hybrid cars will make up the other half of sales. General Motors, the largest automaker in the United States by sales, plans to be completely carbon neutral by 2040, and it hopes to offer only zero-emission cars by 2035. The company plans to reach the goal by transitioning to battery-powered electric vehicles or other zero-emission technologies. The move will require a $27 billion investment.",18/04/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/18/business/business-climate-earth-day-roundup/index.html
US and China agree to cooperate on climate change after talks in Shanghai,"The US and China have agreed to cooperate on climate change after two days of high-profile meetings in Shanghai, despite rising tensions between the two countries. In a joint statement released on Sunday, Washington and Beijing said the climate crisis must be addressed with seriousness and urgency and agreed to work together to strengthen the implementation of the Paris Agreement. The United States and China will continue to discuss, both on the road to COP 26 and beyond, concrete actions in the 2020s to reduce emissions aimed at keeping the Paris Agreement-aligned temperature limit within reach, the statement said. The announcement followed two days of talks between US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry and China Special Envoy for Climate Change Xie Zhenhua in Shanghai on Thursday and Friday. US President Joe Biden, who has taken a stronger stance on dealing with climate change than his predecessor Donald Trump, is hoping the US will be able to work with Beijing to address carbon emissions while maintaining a firm stance on issues of trade, technology and human rights. China is the worlds biggest carbon emitter, making the Chinese governments participation a vital part of any successful plan to address the climate crisis. In a statement Sunday, Chinas Ministry of Ecology and Environment said the talks between Kerry and Xie had been candid, in-depth and constructive. Both sides recognize that climate change is a serious and urgent threat to the survival and development of mankind, the ministry said, adding that China and the US will strengthen cooperation, work together with other parties to address the climate crisis. The ministry also said the two countries will further strengthen exchanges and cooperation in areas such as strengthening policy measures, promoting green and low-carbon transitions, and supporting the energy and low-carbon development of developing countries.",18/04/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/18/politics/us-china-climate-change-shanghai-intl-hnk/index.html
CNN to host climate crisis town hall with Biden administration officials,"Senior Biden administration officials this week will answer questions on how President Joe Biden plans to remake US climate policy in a globally broadcast CNN town hall, the network announced Monday. CNN Town Hall: The Climate Crisis will air Friday at 10 p.m. ET. It coincides with this weeks celebration of Earth Day and will come the day after the Biden administrations conference on global warming. The town hall will feature special presidential envoy for climate John Kerry, White House national climate advisor Gina McCarthy, US Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan and Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm answering questions about the Biden-Harris climate policy. CNN anchor and chief political correspondent Dana Bash will moderate. In addition to video-submitted questions, a small, socially distanced audience will be present to ask the four administration officials about the Biden-Harris administrations remaking of US climate policy following the Donald Trump presidency. The town hall will air on CNN, CNN en Espanol and CNN International; stream live with a log-in to a cable provider on CNNgo, CNN.coms homepage and across mobile devices via CNNs apps for iOS and Android and simulcast on SiriusXM Channels 116, 454 and 795. The town hall can be viewed on CNNgo at CNN.com/go on your desktop, smartphone and iPad, and via CNNgo apps for Apple TV, Amazon Fire, Android TV, Chromecast, Roku and Samsung Smart TV. The special will also be available on demand to subscribers via cable/satellite systems, CNNgo platforms and CNN mobile apps. From the outset, the Biden administration has made climate a key focus. Before taking office, Biden in December announced his climate team, in a historic display of the then-President-elects effort to prioritize his administrations response to the climate crisis. Im pleased to announce a team that will lead my administrations ambitious plan to address the existential threat of our time, climate change, Biden said at the time. And on his first day in office, Biden took executive actions to rejoin the Paris Climate Accord, cancel the Keystone XL pipeline and direct agencies to review and reverse more than 100 Trump actions on the environment. Just a week later, Biden signed several more executive actions related to the climate crisis, including one directing the secretary of the Interior to pause on entering into new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or offshore waters. Since the early days of his administration, Biden and other administration officials have emphasized that the White House is taking a whole of government approach to climate change. Theyve also underscored that they believe the Presidents actions will help spur job growth, and categorized people working in industries vulnerable to job loss, such as coal miners, under their umbrella of environmental justice. Its about coming to the moment to deal with this maximum threat that we exist with as now facing us, climate change, with a greater sense of urgency, he said at a January signing ceremony. In my view, weve already waited too long to deal with this climate crisis. We cant wait any longer. This story has been updated to reflect a new air time.",19/04/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/19/politics/cnn-climate-town-hall/index.html
Biden aims to cement US credibility on climate and galvanize world leaders at virtual summit,"President Joe Bidens ability to galvanize global momentum faces its first major test this week when he convenes 40 of his foreign counterparts for talks on combating the climate crisis. At the virtual summits center will be an aggressive new pledge to halve US carbon emissions, according to administration officials, a target number that has come to symbolize the new Presidents commitment to stave off global warming. But at a broader level, the two-day summit that takes place on Thursday and Friday will amount to an attempt at reasserting American leadership to a world thats grown skeptical of promises from US leaders that can be easily reversed as soon as a new president enters office or can be quickly stymied by a gridlocked Congress. Some Biden administration officials have expressed concern over US standing in the international climate sphere after four years of neglect, and are hoping this weeks summit will once again cement their seat at the table. The results will be immediately apparent. The White House has made clear it hopes other countries will follow the United States in making new pledges to significantly slash their emissions, particularly major economies that produce the bulk of the worlds greenhouse gasses. Bidens ability to wrest those announcements from his counterparts will be put to the test, making this weeks summit a high-stakes gauge of his diplomatic skills. Not all of the leaders beaming in are considered friends. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping have both confirmed their attendance. White House officials have said the issue of climate change must be an area of cooperation, even as relations with Moscow and Beijing reach new lows. But what Putin and Xi say when its their turn to speak  and whether theyll use the occasion to ding Biden at his own summit  remains anyones guess. Known to favor a back-slap and handshake style, Biden will be limited to a computer screen as he seeks to restore American credibility on the world stage while also convincing fellow leaders to make bold pledges to stave off global warming. Officials said the logistics of a virtual summit made pull-asides or individual bilateral meetings difficult to organize, and Biden has found previous virtual meetings with foreign leaders somewhat stilted. This weeks meeting is the largest virtual summit of world leaders to be convened over the past pandemic-altered year. When he begins traveling abroad, potentially as soon as June, Biden is expected to continue pressing on the climate issue leading up to a major summit in Scotland in November. The urgency of the matter was underscored this week in a new report from the International Energy Agency, which estimated carbon emissions from energy use are on track to spike by 1.5 billion tons in 2021 as heavy coal consumption in Asia  China, in particular  outweighs rapid growth in renewable sources. That would be the second largest annual increase in energy-related emissions in history. Biden hopes this weeks event will place the US back at the fore of global efforts to combat climate change after four years in which the issue was neglected. While former President Donald Trump frequently touted the cleanliness of American air and water, he took steps to roll back the carbon reduction efforts made by the Obama administration. A few months into his presidency, Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris climate agreement against the urging of top leaders, who said global unity on the issue was paramount. At a heated G7 summit held cliffside in Sicily, leaders like German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sought to use their first encounter with Trump to press him into remaining in the deal. But Trump refused, announcing in the Rose Garden he had been elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. White House officials insist progress on cutting emissions did not completely stop under Trump; instead it shifted to state and local governments, along with actions taken in the private sector. Indeed, after Trump declared he was looking out for Pittsburgh and not Paris, the mayor of Pittsburgh declared he would continue pressing ahead on reducing carbon emissions anyway. Were pretty close to being on the trajectory we said we would be on, a senior administration official said on Wednesday. The fact that the change in the administration led to a top-line view that it wasnt a priority didnt in fact effect a lot of the trajectory in the country. Biden, who has already reentered the Paris deal, hopes to send a signal both to foreign leaders and an audience at home that he is adopting a different approach than the previous administration. Repairing the damage done to the United States credibility when it comes to international climate policy will be a tall order. Trumps decision to leave the Paris deal marked the second time the US has bailed on an international climate agreement after it led the negotiations. The first exit was from the Kyoto Protocol, a previous climate pact that the US signed during the Clinton administration, only to drop out during George W. Bushs presidency. What we do at home does matter, and that characterization and how others see us acting will be both a beacon for what we want them to do and a signal that we are back and are fully engaging, a senior administration official said in previewing the summit on Wednesday. There is a significant sign that we expect action at this meeting. Were looking for people to make announcements, to raise their ambition, to indicate next steps that they intend to be taking to help solve the climate problem, the official said. Biden plans to deliver inaugural remarks to launch the summit on Thursday morning before sending leaders into break-out sessions centered on themes like climate financing and strengthening resilience in countries vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The major takeaway will be his pledge to cut US greenhouse gas emissions from their 2005 levels in half by 2030, though the White House was still finalizing that target, officials told CNN. The number had been closely watched, with environmental advocates suggesting anything less than a 50% cut would prove a disappointment. When President Barack Obama first joined the Paris climate agreement, he pledged to cut emissions by a range  26% to 28%  by 2025, making the new 50% cut a major jump. But other nations have begun announcing higher targets. The United Kingdom on Tuesday said it was setting a target of reducing emissions by 78% compared to 1990 levels by 2035. Even a 50% cut will be difficult to achieve in the United States, where Republicans and some moderate Democrats remain wary of taking steps that could eliminate jobs in fossil fuels like natural gas and coal. A lack of political consensus in the United States has led to further wariness among foreign leaders at American promises on the issue.",21/04/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/21/politics/climate-summit-white-house/index.html
Biden announces US will aim to cut carbon emissions by as much as 52% by 2030 at virtual climate summit,"President Joe Biden on Thursday kicked off a virtual climate summit attended by 40 other world leaders by announcing an ambitious cut in greenhouse gas emissions as he looks to put the US back at the center of the global effort to address the climate crisis and curb carbon emissions. At the White House summit, which is taking place on Thursday and Friday, Biden committed the United States to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 50%-52% below its 2005 emissions levels by 2030. While the goals are a part of the Paris climate agreement that Biden rejoined upon taking office, they are non-binding and the administration has not rolled out a plan on how the US will meet them. Officials said Biden and his team arrived at the final number in a meeting at the White House on Wednesday morning. In an address opening the summit, Biden laid out his vision for a greener economy in which climate change is taken seriously across all sectors and results in more jobs for the blue-collar workers he has focused on throughout his career. Thats where were headed as a nation, and thats what we can do if we take action to build an economy thats not only more prosperous but healthier, fairer and cleaner for the entire planet, Biden said. These steps will set Americas economy to net-zero emissions by no later than 2050, he added. Biden called on the world leaders gathered at the summit, particularly those who represent the worlds largest economies, to take action within their own countries to curb emissions. No nation can solve this crisis on our own, Biden said. We have to step up, he added. Vice President Kamala Harris, who introduced Biden at the start of the summit, pointed to the extreme weather the US has been battered by in recent years, including the wildfires in her home state of California. As a global community, it is imperative that we act quickly and together to confront this crisis and this will require innovation and collaboration around the world, the vice president said. The Biden administrations target to cut emissions was struck after lengthy consultations with government agencies, scientists, industry representatives, governors, mayors and environmental researchers. The move underscores the Presidents commitment to addressing the climate crisis and follows on his pledge to work with other countries to find joint solutions to global issues. RELATED: Biden aims to cement US credibility on climate and galvanize world leaders at virtual summit When then-President Barack Obama first joined the Paris climate agreement in 2015, he pledged to cut emissions by a range  26% to 28%  by 2025, making the new 50%-52% cut a major jump. A second official said the higher target would give the US significant leverage in convincing other countries to raise their ambitions ahead of a climate summit in Glasgow later this year. What the President will not unveil, at least right now, is a specific road map for how the United States will reach those targets, which are being described as economy-wide. Officials described multiple pathways for the US to arrive at the goal, and said the Presidents climate task force would release sector-by-sector recommendations later this year on achieving the necessary cuts. Biden sought to make the case that taking steps to address the climate crisis would make economies more resilient and competitive. When people talk about climate, I think jobs, Biden said. Within our climate response lies an extraordinary engine of job creation and economic opportunity ready to be fired up. He said: Countries that take decisive action now to create the industries of the future will be the ones that reap the economic benefits of the clean energy boom thats coming. Several members in Bidens Cabinet are playing a role at the summit, including hosting sessions, speaking at sessions and discussing how their role or department or agency pertains to issues surrounding the climate crisis, a separate administration official said earlier this week. The summit focuses on mobilizing public and private sector finance to reach net-zero emissions and build a resilient future, according to the official. The US plans to discuss investing in innovation, which the administration argues is critical to creating transformational technologies to reduce emissions and at the same time creates new economic opportunities. Its hoped that other countries will follow the US lead with additional announcements of new goals to tackle the crisis, the administration official said. There is a significant sign that we expect action at this meeting. Were looking for people to make announcements, to raise their ambition, to indicate next steps that they intend to be taking to help solve the climate problem, the official said. While some countries reiterated that they were working toward their initial goals from the Paris climate agreement, Canadian Prime Minster Justin Trudeau said his country would up its goal to cut carbon emissions. The US neighbor to the north will now aim to cut emissions by 40 to 45% below 2005 levels by 2030, more advanced than the previous goal of 30% below 2005 levels by 2030. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping are two notable leaders attending the summit, underscoring the wide range of leaders attending. Many allies of the US are also in attendance, including French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Xi pledged his countrys commitment to a green development, reaffirming China would achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 and peak carbon emissions by 2030. Speaking about the need for global cooperation on climate, Xi said, Not long ago the Chinese and US sides released a joint statement addressing the climate crisis. China looks forward to working with the international community including the US to jointly advance global environmental governance. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia was committed to carrying out a large-scale campaign for environmental modernization and greater energy efficiency across all economic sectors. Putin said when he gave a speech to the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation on Wednesday he listed significantly reducing the net accumulated emissions in our country by 2050 as a priority. South Korean President Moon Jae-in put forward new pledges to achieve carbon neutrality, including ending all public financing for new overseas coal-fired power plants. He said South Korea has stopped issuing new permits for domestic coal power plants and has drastically reduced its reliance on coal. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said her country wanted to have at least 55% less emissions by 2030 compared to 1990. She said addressing the global climate crisis is a herculean task and said it would involve nothing short of a complete transformation of the way the world conducts business. French President Emmanuel Macron called on leaders to move more quickly on innovative and disruptive technologies. Basically, 2030 is the new 2050, he said. Macron said the world needed to completely transform our financial system in order to achieve carbon emissions goals. If we dont set a price for carbon, there will be no transmission, Macron said. The summit is a stark departure from how climate was approached for the past four years under former President Donald Trump. The former President repeatedly denied the scientific reality of the climate crisis and his administration systematically rolled back environmental policies. Trump withdrew from the Paris agreement, but Biden administration officials said work on reducing carbon emissions proceeded anyway at the state and local level, which prevented the US from losing too much ground. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the United Nations, told The Axe Files with David Axelrod that although Trump was rolling back environmental policies during the past four years, our private sector didnt turn back the clock and our state governments didnt turn back, and the American people broadly didnt turn it back. Its incumbent upon us to continue to build on what were doing during these four years so that its harder for a different administration to turn things around as quickly, Thomas-Greenfield told Axelrod, who is a CNN senior political commentator. Since taking office in January, Biden has elevated climate change as an essential element of US foreign policy and national security. The US reentered the Paris climate accord, the landmark international agreement signed in 2015 to limit global warming, which Trump pulled the US out of. Biden appointed former Secretary of State John Kerry as his special presidential envoy for climate, a Cabinet-level position that sits on the National Security Council. The President also named Gina McCarthy, a former head of the Environmental Protection Agency, as his White House climate czar to lead his newly formed Office of Domestic Climate Policy. Climate is a big focus of the Presidents roughly $2 trillion infrastructure proposal. He has said his proposal would create hundreds of thousands of jobs while tackling the climate crisis, reducing emissions and building a modern, resilient and fully clean grid. Biden focused heavily on the potential economic boon that fighting climate change could present. His critics have described attempts to move the country away from fossil fuel as job-killers. But Biden hopes to highlight the opportunities that would come along with overhauling technology to make it cleaner. There is only one playbook that works in this moment and that playbook is you chase after the economic opportunity that tacking the climate crisis presents and were doing that, the senior administration official said. Officials said they conducted a techno-economic analysis across various sectors  including electricity, transportation, buildings, industry, lands and oceans  to identify various pathways for reducing emissions in each one. That included the potential for new standards and incentives that would limit greenhouse gasses. The 2030 target is a target we believe we can meet, the senior administration official said. As a presidential candidate, Biden put forward a plan to end carbon emissions from power plants by 2035 and proposed broader public investment in green infrastructure, including $2 trillion for clean energy projects.

Biden makes the economic case for fighting climate change on second day of virtual summit,"President Joe Biden on Friday highlighted the economic opportunities of climate action a day after announcing an ambitious new goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the Leaders Summit on Climate from the White House. Todays final session is not about the threat that climate change poses, its about the opportunity that addressing climate change provides, Biden said on the second day of the summit. During his remarks from the White House, the President said he is grateful to all of the world leaders who announced new commitments at the summit to curb emissions, and added that he felt the summit has so far yielded great progress. He also stressed the importance of international cooperation, using his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin as an example that countries can have disagreements and still reach mutual cooperation. Im very heartened by (Putins) call yesterday for the world to collaborate and advance carbon dioxide removal, and the United States looks forward to working with Russia and other countries in that endeavor, Biden said. It has great promise. President Putin and I have our disagreements, but hes talking about how you capture carbon from space, Biden later said. As much as the President of Russia and I disagree, two big nations can cooperate to get something done  and this time, get something done that benefits everybody. What else could there be that would have the opportunity to create so many jobs, while doing so much good? Biden asked. Biden also touted partnerships with other countries  including India, Sweden, United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom  working to de-carbonize critical sectors across the board. Every single one of you ... its astounding. And I think this is part of that sort of fourth industrial revolution here. This is an opportunity and a process this time of doing the right thing and creating jobs of actually bringing our countries closer together, the President said. Biden said he has directed Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm to speed the development of critical technologies to tackle the climate crisis. No single technology is the answer on its own, because every sector requires innovation to meet this moment, Biden said. This critical effort is going to propel the most impactful breakthroughs at home and around the world. Fridays summit events were largely focused on underscoring what the White House has long pitched as a selling point for its ambitious climate goals  that taking action on climate makes financial sense for global powers. There were two sessions. The first was focused on the importance of accelerating public and private investment in climate innovation. The second highlighted the broad economic benefits of climate action, with a strong focus on job creation. On Thursday, the President committed the US to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 50% to 52% below its 2005 emissions levels by 2030. While the goals are a part of the Paris climate agreement that Biden rejoined upon taking office, they are non-binding and the administration has not rolled out a plan on how the US will meet them. Throughout the summits first day, Biden and the White House repeatedly made the case that taking steps to address the climate crisis will make the US and global economy more resilient and competitive. White House National Climate Adviser Gina McCarthy said Thursday that the President believes tackling the climate crisis presents a valuable economic opportunity. And the fact is, creating jobs and tackling climate change go hand in hand. John Kerry, the special presidential envoy for climate, argued that no politician, I think, could change what is now happening globally in the marketplace. And that is part of the message of whats happened during the summit. Biden first proposed a global climate summit on the campaign trail, pledging to convene world leaders within his first 100 days in office to persuade them to join the United States in making more ambitious national pledges, above and beyond the commitments they have already made. The wide range of leaders attending the two-day summit so far has included a number of American allies, such as Frances Emmanuel Macron and the United Kingdoms Boris Johnson, as well as leaders with whom Biden anticipates having a more confrontational relationship, like Chinas Xi Jinping and Putin. While some countries reiterated during the summit that they were working toward their previously set climate goals, others, including Canada and South Korea, announced they were upping their targets. Kerry told reporters at the White House on Thursday that almost all of the top 20 countries emitting the most greenhouse gasses pledged to take additional steps on climate. All 20 of them are here today, and almost all 20 of them were pledging to do additional things, Kerry said. Kerry also indicated that he was pleasantly surprised during the summit by some of the comments made by non-allied leaders, like Putin and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro appeared to moderate his tone on environmental issues during the summit, but critics have cast doubt on his new attitude. Some of the comments that President Bolsonaro made today surprised me ... thats pretty good. That works, if you do those things. The question is will they do them? And the question is whats the follow through and enforcement, Kerry said. Kerry said he thought Putin was pretty rational and put some decent visionary thoughts on things. I think theres room to hopefully have a discussion about this and well see if we can find some common ground. I think thats the most important summary of what I heard in terms of their comments today, Kerry added.

"China? annual emissions surpass those of all developed nations combined, report finds","Chinas annual emissions exceeded those of all developed nations combined in 2019, the first time this has happened since national greenhouse gas emissions have been measured, according to a new report from the Rhodium Group. Chinese President Xi Jinping has vowed to make his country carbon neutral by 2060, and climate policy is seen as a major area of cooperation  and even competition  between the United States and China. But the new report highlights how difficult reducing Chinas impact on the climate could be. According to the researchers, global emissions reached 52 gigatons of CO2-equivalent in 2019, an increase of 11.4% over the past decade. And Chinas share is growing fast. While Chinas emissions were less than a quarter of developed country emissions in 1990, they have more than tripled over the past three decades, the report said. In 2019, they exceeded 14 gigatons of CO2-equivalent for the first time. China alone contributed over 27% of total global emissions, far exceeding the US  the second highest emitter  which contributed 11% of the global total, the report said. For the first time, India edged out the EU-27 for third place, coming in at 6.6% of global emissions. China is a large country, with a population of 1.4 billion, and up to now its per capita emissions have remained considerably lower than those in the developed world, the researchers note. But that, too, is changing fast. In 2019, Chinas per capita emissions reached 10.1 tons, nearly tripling over the past two decades, the report said. While they remained lower in 2019 than the US  17.6 tons a person  the report predicts that when full 2020 data is available, Chinas per capita output will have overtaken the OECD average of 10.5 tons, even as the emissions from almost all other nations declined sharply in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, China still has a way to go before it catches up with the total amount of carbon dioxide that has been spewed into the atmosphere by developed nations. The report notes that since 1750, members of the OECD bloc have emitted four times more CO2 on a cumulative basis than China. Greenhouse gases accumulate in the atmosphere like a blanket, trapping radiation that would otherwise escape into space. This causes temperatures on Earth to rise, which is linked to more extreme weather, ice melt and a rise in sea levels. And the more carbon emitted into the atmosphere, the more the planet will warm. Reinhard Steurer, a climate scientist and associate professor at the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences in Vienna, told CNN that those in the West shouldnt be congratulating themselves just yet. A lot of the stuff we [in the West] consume is produced in China and the emissions are counted into the Chinese carbon emissions record, he said. If you take into account those consumption-based emissions, our record isnt that good... We should never really blame China as the worst emitter on earth, because quite a lot of their emissions go into our consumption.",07/05/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/05/07/world/climate-emissions-china-developed-nations-intl/index.html
Artist Maya Lin planted dead trees in a Manhattan park to show impacts of climate change,"Dead trees and art may be an unusual combination, but the pairing is part of a new display in New York's Madison Square Park designed to highlight a particular phenomenon of climate change: the loss of forests around the world.The display is called ""Ghost Forest,"" a term that refers to dead woodlands that were once vibrant, according to Madison Square Park Conservancy. It's the work of architect and artist Maya Lin, who designed the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, DC.Lin told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that when Madison Square Park Conservancy invited her to create a piece of temporary artwork, she wanted to bring a ghost forest to Manhattan to raise awareness of the ""huge loss that is going on that people might not be aware of."" The 49 Atlantic white cedar trees used in the display come from the Pine Barrens of New Jersey, where they became victims of saltwater inundation.Lin said she was inspired by her late husband and their time in southwestern Colorado, where they spent their summers, to create the piece. She said forests there are killed off by beetles because the winters are too mild.""One season you'll see a little bit of rust on the tops of the trees.

Court orders Shell to slash CO2 emissions in landmark climate ruling,"A Dutch court has ruled that Royal Dutch Shell must dramatically reduce its carbon emissions in a landmark climate decision that could have far reaching consequences for oil companies. The company must slash its CO2 emissions by 45% by 2030 from 2019 levels, according to a judgment from a district court in The Hague on Wednesday. That includes emissions from its own operations and from the energy products it sells. This is the first time that a court has ruled a company needs to reduce its emissions in line with global climate goals, according to Friends of the Earth Netherlands, an environmental campaigning group that brought the case against Shell (RDSA). The verdict could pave the way for similar cases to be brought in other countries, forcing oil companies to reduce fossil fuel production. It comes just a week after the influential International Energy Agency told oil companies they need to stop drilling for oil and gas right now to prevent a climate catastrophe. The Anglo-Dutch company announced plans in September to become a net zero emissions company by 2050, a target that includes emissions from its products. It is currently targeting a 20% reduction in carbon intensity by 2030, and 45% by 2035. This is a turning point in history, said Roger Cox, lawyer for Friends of the Earth Netherlands. This case is unique because it is the first time a judge has ordered a large polluting corporation to comply with the Paris Climate Agreement. This ruling may also have major consequences for other big polluters, added Cox. The impact of the decision will be amplified because the court relied on global human rights standards and international instruments on climate change in arriving at its decision, according to legal experts. I can imagine this will inspire a series of other cases against companies, especially those active in the oil extraction industries like Shell, said Eric De Brabandere, a professor of international dispute settlement at Leiden University in the Netherlands. It is a groundbreaking decision, its really a landmark. While Shell claims that its carbon intensity targets are aligned with the Paris Agreement  which aims to limit global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius  Friends of the Earth Netherlands argues that the companys ongoing investments into oil and gas extraction show that it doesnt take climate change seriously. The court found that Shells carbon emissions pose a very serious threat to Dutch residents, and that the company has an individual responsibility to reduce emissions. The court said the company would have total freedom to comply with its order and to shape corporate policy. Shell indicated it would appeal the ruling, which is immediately enforceable, according to De Brabandere. We are investing billions of dollars in low-carbon energy, including electric vehicle charging, hydrogen, renewables and biofuels. We want to grow demand for these products and scale up our new energy businesses even more quickly. We will continue to focus on these efforts and fully expect to appeal todays disappointing court decision, a Shell spokesperson said in a statement. Oil companies are facing mounting pressure from shareholders and activists to ditch fossil fuels and invest into cleaner energy sources. The ruling handed down on Wednesday may sound revolutionary, but, in fact, it is in line with what long term investors are increasingly asking companies to do anyway, said Cees van Dam, a professor of international business and human rights at the Rotterdam School of Management. At its annual meeting on Wednesday, ExxonMobil will face a challenge from activist investor Engine No. 1, which is seeking to replace almost a third of the companys board to try and force it to move more quickly on climate change. Also on Wednesday, shareholders will vote on emissions reductions targets at Chevron (CVX)s annual meeting. Shell is the first but will not be the last company that will be forced to stop dangerous climate change, Friends of the Earth Netherlands director Donald Pols told reporters on Wednesday. As of today climate lawsuits are a material risk for all major polluters in the world, he added. This is the third recent case Shell has lost involving the environment. In February, the UK Supreme Court ruled that thousands of Nigerians can sue Shell in English courts over environmental damage. In January, a Dutch court ordered Shells Nigeria unit to compensate locals for oil pipeline leaks that took place more than a decade ago.

"Climate change could push temperatures at the Tokyo Olympics to the ?anger-zone?for athletes, report warns","Intense heat and high humidity could pose a serious risk to athletes at this years Tokyo Olympics, according to a new report. The report, published Wednesday by the British Association for Sustainable Sport, details the concerns of leading athletes and scientists about the health impacts of soaring temperatures in Japan. According to the report, the average annual temperature in Tokyo has increased by 2.86 degrees Celsius since 1900, more than three times as fast as the worlds average. The Olympics are due to run from July 23 to August 8  a time when Japan usually experiences its highest annual temperatures, which are soaring even higher in the warming climate. I think were certainly approaching a danger-zone, Great Britain rower and Olympic hopeful Melissa Wilson told the studys authors. Its a horrible moment when you see athletes cross the line, their bodies fling back in total exhaustion, and then not rise up. Some events at the upcoming Summer Games have already been moved away from Tokyo amid heat concerns, including the marathon, which will take place nearly 500 miles north of the Japan capital in Sapporo where temperatures are expected to be much cooler. READ: Canceling Tokyo Olympics is essentially off the table, says IOC member Dick Pound The study details how events such as the triathlon, the marathon, tennis and rowing could be adversely impacted by hot conditions. It also provides advice to athletes on how to cope with competing in the heat, as well as warning how the climate crisis could derail sporting events in the future. Olympic organisers must take the warnings in this report seriously or face a real risk of competitors collapsing through heat exhaustion, said Mike Tipton, professor of human and applied physiology at the Extreme Environments Laboratory, School of Sport, Health & Exercise Science at the UKs University of Portsmouth. In a sporting context, a hot and/or humid environment can represent a risk to the performance and health of spectators, officials and athletes. From sunburn, through cognitive impairment, to heat exhaustion or collapse from heat stroke, all facets of a sporting event  and all those involved  can be adversely affected. In a statement to CNN, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said that athletes health and well-being are always at the heart of our concerns and that a wide range of measures are being taken ... to mitigate the effects of the temperatures which may occur this summer. These measures include changing the start times of some events  such as long-distance running, rugby, triathlon and cycling  and equipping events with shade, water sprays and access to water supplies. The IOC takes concerns about heat very seriously, the statement added. The Olympic Games are the platform where athletes can give once-in-a-lifetime performances, and these measures ensure they have the conditions to give their best. READ: What could happen if the Tokyo Olympics get canceled? In recent years, Japan has seen record-breaking temperatures during the summer months as heat waves have become increasingly commonplace. The heat wave of 2018 resulted in more than 1,000 deaths, according to the Japanese government. While the average high temperature in Tokyo during the Olympics (late July to early August) is 30-31 C (86-88 F), they frequently experience high temperatures in the mid 30s (mid 90s F) and in recent years have even approached 40 C (104 F), said CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward. Combining this heat with very high humidity has led to several deadly summer heat waves across Japan in recent years. These conditions will no doubt put extreme strain on athletes in outdoor venues during the Olympics, Ward said. These recent summer heat waves that have impacted many areas across East Asia (and the globe) can be attributed, in part, to climate change and global warming. As our planet warms due to increasing greenhouse gas emissions, our climate is changing in many ways. One of those ways is increased heat waves  longer duration, more intense, and greater frequency. Recent scientific studies have attributed more extreme heat waves in Japan to climate change, and notes that they are becoming increasingly likely as the planet warms. READ: IOC chief says Olympics will be held safely despite Japans Covid surge When Tokyo last hosted the Olympics in 1964, it did so in the cooler month of October. But broadcasting demands now stipulate that the Games are held in July or August, according to Reuters  a more favorable slot for TV networks. Its not just the Olympics that has to take searing temperatures into consideration. At the 2019 World Athletics Championships in Doha, Qatar, marathon runners toiled in 32-degree heat and humidity levels above 70%, even after start times were moved to midnight. In the womens event, 28 of the 68 runners who started failed to finish and some had to be stretchered off the course. At tennis Australian Open, meanwhile, recent temperatures have been known to exceed 40 degrees Celsius, causing players to faint on the court.",26/05/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/05/25/sport/olympics-heat-climate-change-spt-intl/index.html
"Earliest known war driven by climate change, researchers say","The 61 human skeletons unearthed in the Nile Valley in the 1960s in what is now Sudan have long been regarded as the earliest evidence of organized warfare between humans. The remains uncovered at Jebel Sahaba, which are more than 13,000 years old, show injuries sustained as a result of brutal and intense violence  mainly puncture wounds from weapons such as spears and arrows. However, a new study published in the journal Scientific Reports that reexamined the remains using the latest scientific methods suggests that the group were not killed in a one-off massacre as previously thought. More likely they were killed during sporadic and recurrent violence that took place over several years and was probably triggered by major climatic and environmental changes during the period. The researchers from France and the United Kingdom found healed injuries on the skeletons that hadnt been documented in previous studies on the remains  suggesting there were multiple raids, ambushes and skirmishes within these peoples lifetimes. Everybody in what would have been a community of hunters, fishers and gatherers was a target for violence, with men, women and children affected in an indiscriminate manner, said Isabelle Crevecoeur, a researcher at the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) and the University of Bordeaux. The only difference is related to what might be close combat. Women have more parry fractures of the forearm and men more fractures of the hand. In a close combat event, women might more instinctively try to protect themselves (with arms) while men might fight more with their hands. The children in the cemetery were more likely to have sustained blunt force trauma to the head. And the projectile nature of the wounds suggested that the violence wasnt domestic or between members of the same community, she added. The researchers revealed more than 100 new wounds  both healed and unhealed on the skeletons and some of them had flakes from stone weapons still embedded in the bones. Almost all the individuals had evidence of trauma, whether from bone fractures or puncture wounds from projectile weapons. Some 40% of the individuals had both healed and unhealed injuries, suggesting that violence was part of the fabric of life at that time. They were also able to accurately date the skeletons to at least 13,400 years old through radiocarbon dating, making it the earliest known cemetery and example of interpersonal violence in the world. She said there was no way to be sure about what people were fighting about as there are no written documents. That said, the researchers believe that the conflict arose as rival groups that lived in the area competed for food and resources limited by dramatic changes in climate. Those changes took place between 11,000 and 20,000 years ago toward the end of a period known as the last glacial maximum, when ice sheets covered much of the Northern Hemisphere, disrupting the Earths climate. Crevecoeur said the Nile Valley might have been a refuge for different groups of humans that once lived across a wide area as a very arid climate drove them toward the river, where it would have been easier to find animals to hunt and fish. There was also evidence of very severe flooding of the Nile at this time, she added. These changes were not gradual at all. They had to survive these changes that were brutal, Crevecoeur said.",27/05/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/05/27/africa/violence-war-climate-jebel-sahaba-scn/index.html
"Climate change could ignite a financial crisis, IMF official says","Climate change poses serious risks to the stability of the financial system, a senior International Monetary Fund official told CNN Business. Tobias Adrian, director of the IMFs monetary and capital markets department, said the climate crisis could absolutely ignite a financial crisis. The climate crisis is slow in the making, but its potentially disastrous, Adrian said in an interview from the sidelines of the Green Swan Conference, a virtual event focused on how the financial industry can take action against climate risks. Adrian, a former official at the New York Federal Reserve Bank, pointed to how the economies of the Bahamas, Philippines and other nations have been crushed by hurricanes and typhoons in recent years. There are many countries where you see the climate catastrophe is catastrophic for the financial system, he said. Even if you dont believe its the central scenario, there is still quite a bit of downside risk. And risk management is all about making sure that even in the worst cases, you are able to survive. The comments echo a warning made last September in a federal report that acknowledged climate change poses a major risk to the stability of the US financial system and to its ability to sustain the American economy. The report, published by the climate subcommittee of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, implored regulators to more urgently and decisively work to address looming economic damage from climate change. In March, researchers at the Federal Reserve wrote in a report that climate-related economic or financial risks may not necessarily impact financial stability, though they acknowledged that is a possibility under certain scenarios. Storms, floods, wildfires or other acute hazards can quickly change or reveal new information about the economic outlook or the value of financial assets, the Fed report said. Climate risks can manifest as shocks to the financial system, the researchers wrote. The Fed researchers added that economic and financial risks can amplify one another, for example if weather-related property destruction sparked bank losses that led to less lending and reduced investment. With the potential for sudden, large shifts in perceptions of risk, chronic hazards could produce abrupt repricing events, if investor expectations or sentiment about the physical risks change abruptly, the report said, adding that more research is needed to better understand these risks. US financial regulators, after taking a largely hands-off approach during the Trump administration, have only just begun to examine these risk factors. In December, the Fed formally joined the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System, one of the co-sponsors of the Green Swan Conference. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said last month that she and President Biden are committed to using the full power of the US federal government to address climate change. Adrian outlined four key areas where climate should be incorporated into financial regulation, including by introducing climate stress testing of physical risks and how exposed economies are to the energy transition. The climate crisis is an existential crisis, the IMF official said. It will require a certain degree of shifts in how we look at exposures. That is the point of climate stress tests: to make investors aware. In capital markets, the shift is already happening. While the IMF is already conducting climate stress tests on some countries, such an evaluation would require regulatory or even legislative changes in the United States. Adrian also called for revamped standards for data and disclosure around climate risks to boost transparency. Climate data is very noisy at the moment. Its very hard to classify to what degree a given company is green or brown, he said. Gary Gensler, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, recently told Congress he plans to introduce new rules around corporate climate disclosures later this year. Meanwhile, Adrian said regulators must do more work on how to regulate financial institutions in a way that makes the system more climate friendly. That is still in its infancy, he said. Lastly, Adrian said central banks need to evaluate how to incorporate climate into monetary policy and asset purchases  a step that the IMF official acknowledged is quite controversial. Indeed, a dozen Republican senators wrote a letter to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell in March questioning the central banks jurisdiction and expertise in environmental matters. This effort is not grounded in science or economics, they wrote, but is instead a self-fulfilling prophesy: claim there are financial risks with energy exploration and other disfavored investments then use the levers of government  via the unelected bureaucracy  to ban or limit those activities. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell pushed back by pointing out the US central bank supervises banks. The reason were focused on climate change, Powell said during a speech in April, is that our job is to make sure that financial institutions, banks, particularly the largest ones, understand and are able to manage the significant risks that they take.",03/06/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/03/investing/climate-change-financial-crisis-imf/index.html
Fact check: Gohmert? attempts to connect moon orbits and solar flares to climate change,"Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas made an argument about climate change at a House subcommittee hearing Tuesday that appeared to elicit confusion from a government official and ridicule on Twitter. During the Natural Resources Subcommittee hearing, Gohmert appeared to draw a connection between the moon and Earths orbit and solar flares to climate change. In questioning US Forest Service Associate Deputy Chief Jennifer Eberlien, Gohmert asked if the National Forest Service or Bureau of Land Management could change the orbits of the moon and Earth, making a comment that some saw as an attempt to argue that climate change should be viewed as a natural phenomenon rather than man-made. I was informed by the immediate past director of NASA that they have found that the moons orbit is changing slightly and so is the Earths orbit around the sun, Gohmert said. We know theres been significant solar flare activity. And so, is there anything that the National Forest Service or BLM (Bureau of Land Management) can do to change the course of the moons orbit or the Earths orbit around the sun? Obviously, that would have profound effects on our climate, the congressman asked Eberlien. Eberlien responded that she would have to follow up with you on that one, Mr. Gohmert. Facts First: Gohmerts remark makes little sense. The insinuation that solar flares and orbital activity cause or greatly contribute to the climate change seen today is completely incorrect. Greenhouse gases produced by humans are the primary driver of the earths rapid warming. Gohmerts office did not respond to CNNs requests to clarify his remarks, which were widely mocked on Twitter. Brian Brettschneider, a climate scientist and professor at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, wrote tersely, We cannot change the Earths or Moons orbit. Thank you for coming to my TED Talk. The science-y sounding reasons most politicians use to reject climate change are not primarily due to lack of education or knowledge, Katharine Hayhoe, climate scientist and co-director of the Climate Center at Texas Tech University, wrote on Twitter. No: they are deliberately manufactured and offered as palatable excuses to hide the real problem: solution aversion. They dont want to fix it. Everything Gohmert asserted has been debunked by NASA. In an article written by NASA, the agency notes  citing the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  that the scientific consensus is that long and short-term variations in solar activity play only a very small role in Earths climate. The article also notes that the warming driven by greenhouse gases produced by humans is 50 times greater than the slight extra warming coming from the Sun itself over that same time interval. The idea that the changing of the Earths and moons orbits is also a major contributor to climate change is incorrect. As NASA notes in an article on the orbital cycles of the Earth, the cycles cannot account for the current period of rapid warming. These cycles occur over tens to hundreds of thousands of years. Meanwhile, NASA says, Scientists are confident Earths recent warming is primarily due to human activities  specifically, the direct input of carbon dioxide into Earths atmosphere from burning fossil fuels.",10/06/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/09/politics/louie-gohmert-climate-change-fact-check/index.html
Investors holding $41 trillion demand action on climate ?now,"Investors managing more than $41 trillion in assets are loudly calling on world leaders to immediately step up their climate game if they dont want to miss out on a wave of clean energy investment. More than 450 major investors signed a letter that was released Thursday urging governments to set more ambitious emission reduction targets, detail clear road maps to decarbonize pollution-heavy industries and implement mandatory climate risk disclosure requirements. The letter, signed by Fidelity, State Street and other influential asset management firms, marks the strongest call yet from investors urging governments around the world to take bolder steps to fight the climate crisis. And it comes just as the leaders of G7 nations meet in the United Kingdom to discuss the Covid-19 pandemic, climate change and other major global issues. These gaps  in climate ambition, policy action and risk disclosure  need to be addressed with urgency, the signatories wrote in the letter. The not-so-subtle warning is that countries that drag their feet risk being left behind as investors send their money elsewhere. Those who set ambitious targets in line with achieving net-zero emissions, and implement consistent national climate policies in the short-to-medium term, will become increasingly attractive investment destinations, the letter read. Countries that fail to do so will find themselves at a competitive disadvantage. New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, who signed the letter, told CNN Business that governments around the world need to adopt policies to protect the planet. Were in this together, DiNapoli said in an email. Investors cant address the climate emergency on their own, but governments cant reach climate solutions without investors. The coalition of investors called on world leaders to significantly strengthen their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) to battling climate change for 2030 and to ensure a planned transition to net-zero emissions by 2050 or sooner. In April, President Joe Biden announced the United States will aim to slash greenhouse gas emissions by 50% to 52% below 2005 levels by 2030. However, the investor group, which also includes Allianz Global Investors and the California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS), warned that all governments must ramp up those goals to limit the global temperature rise. Our ability to properly allocate the trillions of dollars needed to support the net-zero transition is limited by the ambition gap between current government commitments, the letter said, and the emission reductions needed to limit global average temperature rise to 1.5-degrees Celsius. The signatories added: If we do not meet this challenge and change course immediately, the world could heat in excess of 3-degrees Celsius this century. DiNapoli said the goals of the NDC as laid out by Biden are solid, but we need more information about how were going to achieve them. Were looking for tangible investments in the infrastructure bill and other proposals that will provide a road map, he said. In a separate letter from 180 investors with $2.7 trillion in assets, dozens of nonprofits and 155 companies including Apple (AAPL), Uber (UBER) and Salesforce (CRM) called on the Securities and Exchange Commission to mandate climate disclosures. The group argued that companies and investors need access to consistent, comparable and reliable information to assess the risks posed to the economy and specific companies. While there will be a cost for compliance with SEC climate disclosure rules, the letter said, it is far less costly to companies and their investors than ignoring the risk. Gary Gensler, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, recently told Congress he plans to introduce new rules around corporate climate disclosures later this year. Last month, the US Chamber of Commerce opposed a bill that would require the SEC to establish climate-related risk disclosure metrics and public companies to disclose their financial and business risks linked to climate change. Disclosures should be used to protect investors and should not be used as a means to achieve policy goals outside the scope of the federal securities laws, the Chamber wrote in a letter. The debate over how to respond to the climate crisis comes amid rising awareness from the public, business leaders and regulators about the consequences of climate change. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said last week there is no doubt that the climate crisis poses profound challenges for the global economy and certainly the financial system. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde urged fellow central bankers to acknowledge how the climate crisis could cause financial instability and make it difficult for central banks to manage the economy. Our house is burning, Lagarde said at the Green Swan Conference. Tobias Adrian, director of the IMFs monetary and capital markets department, told CNN Business the climate crisis could absolutely ignite a financial crisis. Mindy Lubber, the CEO of Ceres, a sustainability nonprofit that helped organize the investor letter, said investors are aware of the substantial risks in getting climate policy right. Investors know that the impacts of the climate crisis are systemic financial risks, Lubber said in a statement, and will worsen, if left unchecked.",10/06/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/10/investing/climate-change-g7-investors/index.html
G7 leaders share a bold vision for a net zero future. But the devil is in the lack of detail,"Climate change is rarely a main talking point at the G7 leaders summit, but as US President Joe Biden proclaimed that America is back at the table on the final day of this years meeting, by extension, so too was climate change. Past summits with Donald Trump representing the United States struggled to culminate in cohesive group statements between its members  the US, UK, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Canada, plus the European Union. But in the English county of Cornwall over the weekend, leaders appeared to agree that this is the crucial decade that will determine the worlds future, even its very existence. There was concrete progress earlier in the summit from G7 ministers, and a vision laid out by leaders for a net zero world (where all greenhouse gases emitted are removed from the atmosphere) that would take a green approach to everything, from the economic recovery from the pandemic to the way new infrastructure is built in the developing world. What was lacking in the final communique, however, was the detail that climate change experts were hoping for. G7 meetings are notorious for making bold promises only to break them. Often world leaders vision just isnt backed by lawmakers at home. This year, there were some ambitious collective targets, to halve emissions by 2030 from 2010 levels, for example, but no individual country increased its commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and goals were set with no firm deadlines or measurables. In cases where they were, they were largely underwhelming. The leaders said, for example, that they would aim to reach net zero by 2050 at the latest. Thats about 20 years too late, according to Catherine Pettengell, interim head of the UKs branch of Climate Action Network, which represents more than 1,500 civil society organizations in over 130 countries. We were really expecting to see the G7 step up and send a strong signal ahead of COP26 that theyve really done their homework and were ready to act, she told CNN, referring to international climate change talks planned in Glasgow later this year. She is particularly concerned about the lack of progress on a climate finance fund agreed to more than a decade ago. By 2020, developed nations were supposed to start transferring $100 billion a year to the developing world to help them adapt to climate change. The idea was that wealthy countries had historically done more to contribute to climate change while poorer nations will be worst affected by its impact. The world missed that 2020 deadline and is still way off keeping its promise. The US and UK had already doubled their annual contributions, and over the weekend, Germany and Canada at least doubled their pledges too. The other G7 members are lagging. Even with new announcements from Germany and Canada, all G7 countries need to go further and faster with their individual commitments as well as take collective responsibility for achieving the $100 billion goal before COP26, Pettengell said. They acknowledge in the communique that more commitments must come by COP. So I think the question is, Why not now? Whats the delay? Developing countries deserve to have the confidence going into COP 26 that the Paris Agreement will be delivered. And it cant go down to the wire. These leaders need to prioritise building trust and momentum now with the four and a half months left to COP 26. Theres a lot at stake. Carbon emissions are at their highest level in history, despite more than a year of the worlds economies slowing during the pandemic. The goal is to keep global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The Earth is already at 1.3C, and if it exceeds that threshold, millions more people will be at risk of extreme heat waves, drought and flooding. Food shortages will worsen. Entire species will face extinction. Coral reefs will all but disappear. Environmental groups had hoped Japan and Canada in particular would increase their emissions reduction pledges. The countries commitments fall short of those of their G7 allies. Japan had agreed to wind down its more inefficient, old coal power stations, but it is still heavily reliant on the fossil fuel. Canada pledged to reach net zero by 2050, two decades later than some of its G7 allies. When asked by CNN on Saturday if Japan would boost its pledge, Press Secretary Tomoko Yoshida said he shouldnt speculate around the plans of Japans leaders, adding that weve committed ourselves to join the international efforts and also ... engagement with companies to achieve its current targets. Canadas foreign affairs ministry did not immediately respond to CNNs requests for comment. Ahead of the leaders summit, ministers in finance, and environment and energy hammered out some breakthrough agreements, including making it mandatory for big business to disclose the climate impacts of their operations by 2022; to protect 30% of their countrys land and sea by 2030, in line with scientific advice; and to stop funding coal generation around the world by years end, an important step to phase out the worlds dirtiest fossil fuel. And in recognition that climate change measures need to be integrated in both the economic recovery from the pandemic and all future approaches to infrastructure and development, the G7 launched a vision for an alternative to Chinas Belt and Road initiative called, a little less memorably, the Build Back Better World plan, which will promote sustainable, low-carbon development. China has deals with more than 100 countries, most in the developing world, to build major infrastructure projects, like railroads, airports and motorways. The US and its allies meet and coordinate their responses to China, partly in response to it growing global influence through such programs. The G7 may have served as a stepping-stone to COP 26, where there is growing pressure on countries to nail down those details missing from Sundays closing statement. There is likely to be a strong focus there on achieving net zero. Yet Tim Smit, an environmentalist and co-founder of Cornwalls Eden Project, says the idea of net zero is rubbish. Net zero will not bring an end to the emission of carbon or the use of fossil fuels, Smit told CNN. Instead, he says, it will allow business as usual for the worst emitters. All Im saying about net zero is what I also say about carbon capture  it is a device often used by vested interests in fossil fuels to imply the problem is under control with technology, technology that is still being developed, as if that will sort things out. And it is exactly like you being a chain smoker not stopping because youve been told a pill is imminent, that will prevent you getting lung cancer, he said. Carbon capture is the removal of carbon either at the fossil fuels source or from the atmosphere. Real emissions cuts and low-carbon economies, and eventually a full transition to renewables, is whats needed, he said. Smits Eden Project wants to prove that its possible to establish systems that create no waste and no emissions. The project converted a china clay pit  a wasteland and eyesore  to a lush expanse of trees and dome-shaped greenhouses that nurture plants from all over the world. The Eden Project grows everything from vegetables and tea, to hops to make beer and plants to use as natural clothing dyes. Its working to clean the human waste its own visitors provide as a water source, and it is exploring geothermal as its main source of energy. The project is profitable too, and has created green jobs. It cost 140 million to build but has brought in 2.2 billion to the local economy, and attracted 22 million visitors, according to Smit. The hope is Eden can inspire people around the world to come up with similar systems and solutions. If Eden can demonstrate, and do the measuring, to give confidence to others to know how this works, we dont need to change the world  the world is full of smarter people than us, Smit said. They just need to be given information and good data.",14/06/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/14/world/g7-climate-change-dewan-cmd-intl/index.html
An eighth of the US population is sweltering under a record-breaking heat dome. Climate change is making it worse,"With upwards of 300 record-high temperatures in jeopardy this week, more than an eighth of the US population  over 40 million people  are on alert across the western US for a long-lasting, potentially lethal heat wave. No easy way to say this, so well just cut straight to the chase: its going to be *very* hot for a *long time*, tweeted the National Weather Service in Salt Lake City in the lead-up to this historic heat wave. This heat wave and the exceptional drought in the Southwest are part of a damaging feedback loop enhanced by climate change, experts say. The hotter it gets, the drier it gets; the drier it gets, the hotter it gets. When it comes to extreme weather, climate change is loading the weather dice against us, Katharine Hayhoe, a climate researcher and the chief scientist for the Nature Conservancy, told CNN Weather in an email. We always have a chance of extreme heat, particularly in the summer: but as the world warms, we see that summer heatwaves are coming earlier, lasting longer, and are becoming hotter and more intense. On Tuesday, Salt Lake City recorded its third consecutive day of triple-digit heat, setting both daily and all-time records along the way. The city soared to a high of 107 degrees on Tuesday afternoon, tying its all-time record high, previously reached in the month of July. For some perspective, records in Salt Lake City date back to 1874. In that time, there have been over 50,000 calendar days of temperatures observed. Tuesday marks only the third time the city has ever soared to 107 degrees, roughly a 1 in 50 year event. The cause is a massive ridge of high pressure, commonly referred to as a heat dome, that is rapidly gaining strength over the western US. A combination of sinking air, clear skies and lengthy solar radiation will send temperatures as much as 10 to 25 degrees above seasonal values this week. This ridge is also responsible for the unrelenting drought, as it directs rain away from the region. The hotter it gets, the stronger the ridge, said Hayhoe. So while climate change may not be responsible for the ridge forming, it can make it last longer and be stronger than it would be otherwise, which makes the drought more intense and longer. Amid a historic drought and the lowest water level on record in nearby Lake Mead, the state of Nevada will also be challenging its all-time record high this week, currently held by the town of Laughlin, which reached 125 degrees on June 29, 1994. Highs in Laughlin are forecast to be between 120 and 122 from Wednesday to Sunday; the average this time of year is 106 degrees. Widespread triple-digit records are being observed as far north as Idaho and Montana. On Tuesday, Billings, Montana, soared to 105 degrees, matching the hottest weather ever seen in June while obliterating the daily record of 98 degrees, which stood for over 30 years. As the week progresses, so does the long duration heat wave. On Wednesday afternoon, the city of Las Vegas will be knocking on the doorsteps of history as highs are forecast to reach 116 degrees, just 1 degree shy of the citys all-time record of 117 degrees. Thats benchmark that has only been achieved four times since records began in 1937. Check the forecast highs for these cities and yours Not too far away in Phoenix, where residents are well accustomed to oppressive heat, the mercury is forecast to impress even by Phoenician standards. Highs this time of year typically settle in around 105 degrees. The average first 115-degree day generally arrives during the first week of July. However, with summer officially four days away, high temperatures in Phoenix soared to a record of 115 degrees on Tuesday. In fact, forecast models indicate that they may reach or exceed 115 degrees every day from Wednesday through Friday. This would tie the all-time record for most consecutive 115 degree days in Phoenix at four days. Perhaps not surprisingly, in the summer of 2020, the city reached 115 degrees on four successive days on two separate occasions. In the US, five of the 10 hottest years on record have all occurred since 2012, and the broader trend signals little change. There have always been heat waves, droughts, wildfires and more, well before humans started changing climate. What scientists are increasingly beginning to say, explains Hayhoe, is how much worse climate change is making these events. Scientists are starting to be able to say a lot! and even to answer this question with numbers for specific events, she said. For example, scientists have found that climate change made the 2019 European heatwave 10 times more likely, and the Siberian heatwave of June 2020 600 times more likely. In the future, heat waves and drought will likely worsen, Hayhoe said. Particularly in areas already naturally at risk from drought. Ironically, climate change will also make heavy rain events more frequent. Which isnt good news either, explains Hayhoe. It can be damaging, and it makes it hard to replenish soil water and groundwater depleted during a drought when rain falls in heavy downpours as most of it just runs off. The future looks different than the records of the past. We can no longer rely on the past as a reliable predictor for future conditions, as weve been doing for hundreds and even thousands of years, Hayhoe said. Instead, we must prepare for conditions that are hotter and droughts that are more damaging than weve seen before.",16/06/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/16/weather/west-heat-wave-records-drought-climate/index.html
"The amount of heat the Earth traps has doubled in just 15 years, study shows","The planet is trapping roughly double the amount of heat in the atmosphere than it did nearly 15 years ago, according to an alarming new analysis from NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Researchers say its a remarkable amount of energy that is already having far-reaching consequences. Its excess energy thats being taken up by the planet, said Norman Loeb, a NASA scientist and lead author of the study, so its going to mean further increases in temperatures and more melting of snow and sea ice, which will cause sea level rise  all things that society really cares about. The study, published this week in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, found that whats known as the Earths energy imbalance  the difference between how much of the suns energy the planet absorbs and how much energy is radiated back into space  approximately doubled from 2005 to 2019. The result was striking, the research team wrote. Life on Earth couldnt exist without the suns energy, but it matters how much of that energy is radiated back into space. Its a delicate balance that determines the planets climate. In addition to higher global temperatures, the most obvious effect of a positive imbalance, Loeb told CNN were going to be seeing shifts in atmospheric circulations including more extreme events like droughts. Using satellite data to measure the imbalance, scientists found that the Earth is gaining more energy than it should and causing the planet to heat up even more, also known as a positive energy imbalance. Approximately 90 percent of the excess energy from this imbalance ends up in the ocean. And warming ocean temperatures lead to acidification, impacting fish and other marine biodiversity. When researchers compared the satellite measurements with data from a global array of ocean sensors, the findings exhibited a similar trend. The remaining energy, meanwhile, stays in the atmosphere. The cause of this energy imbalance is certainly due in part to human-induced greenhouse gas emissions, the researchers report. Its also affected by some of the positive feedback loops caused by climate change: as global temperature increases, the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere also rises, which further increases the temperature. Melting snowpack and sea ice  natural reflectors of solar energy  is decreasing due to global warming as well. Another contributing factor is how the Pacific Decadal Oscillation  often described as a longer term El Nino-like climate pattern in the Pacific  stayed in a severely warm phase from 2014 through 2020. Because of this sudden flip from a cool to an extended warm phase, cloud cover over the ocean dwindled, allowing the Pacific Ocean to absorb more solar radiation. Its man-made change thats shifting the composition of the atmosphere, as well as fluctuations in the climate systems, Loeb said. The observations are all kind of blended together. Against the backdrop of the Wests historic drought and extreme heat, the study warns that the amount of heat the Earth traps must decline, or climate change will continue to worsen. Loeb described his teams chosen time period, 2005 to 2019, as a mere snapshot of whats to come in terms of climate impacts, adding that more studies and long-term observations need to be done in order to fully grasp the long-term trend. My hope is the rate that were seeing this energy imbalance subsides in the coming decades, said Loeb. Otherwise, were going to see more alarming climate changes.",18/06/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/17/us/earth-trapped-heat-doubled/index.html
Why scientists and meteorologists are wearing blue and red stripes,"As extreme drought plagues the Western US and more intense storms brew in the tropics, climate-minded people joined scientists and meteorologists on Monday in a campaign to turn the worlds attention toward the climate crisis. At its core, the #ShowYourStripes campaign is a visual one, designed to illustrate something inherently difficult to picture: how much the Earth has warmed. From left to right, each stripe in the design represents a years worth of temperature change since the early 20th century. The blue shades indicate cooler-than-average years, while the shades of red are hotter-than-average years. The images show a significant shift from blue to red in recent years, signaling an alarming rise in temperatures around the world. The deep red stripes on the right side underscore how human activity has contributed to planet-heating emissions over time. Ed Hawkins, a climate researcher at the University of Reading and the creator of the stripes, said the most striking change recently has been that nearly every country has a dark red stripe at the end. The idea [behind the stripes] is to communicate climate change in a simple, stark and compelling way as possible, Hawkins said Monday during a video conversation with Climate Central. Its just using color to show reality of our warming world. The design has become a trend since Hawkins debuted it in 2018. The stripes have been worn as badges by members of Congress, used on the cover of the Economist and as the backdrop for concerts. They were even used as a custom wrap for a Tesla. In addition to the design making it to London Fashion Week this year, here are ways people around the world are showcasing the warming stripes and raising awareness around the severity of climate change.",21/06/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/21/us/climate-change-stripes/index.html
"Climate change has pushed a million people in Madagascar to the ?dge of starvation,?UN says","Climate change is the driving force of a developing food crisis in southern Madagascar, the UNs World Food Programme (WFP) has warned. The African island has been plagued with back-to-back droughts  its worst in four decades  which have pushed 1.14 million people right to the very edge of starvation, said WFP executive director David Beasley in a news release Wednesday. I met women and children who were holding on for dear life, theyd walked for hours to get to our food distribution points. These were the ones who were healthy enough to make it, Beasley said. Families are suffering and people are already dying from severe hunger. This is not because of war or conflict, this is because of climate change. This is an area of the world that has contributed nothing to climate change, but now, theyre the ones paying the highest price.An estimated 14,000 people are already in catastrophic conditions, according to the WFP, a number that is predicted to double to 28,000 by October. Thousands in southern Madagascar have left their homes in search of food, while those who remain are resorting to extreme measures such as foraging for wild food to survive, the WFP said. This is enough to bring even the most hardened humanitarian to tears. Families have been living on raw red cactus fruits, wild leaves and locusts for months now. We cant turn our backs on the people living here while the drought threatens thousands of innocent lives, said Beasley. Now is the time to stand up, act and keep supporting the Malagasy government to hold back the tide of climate change and save lives. The WFP needs $78.6 million dollars to provide lifesaving food in the next lean season and prevent a greater tragedy, it said. Beasleys warning came a day after the WFP said 41 million people in 43 countries were now teetering on the edge of starvation, with 584,000 already experiencing famine-like conditions across Madagascar, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Nigeria, Burkina Faso and Yemen. This number has increased from 27 million in 2019. Conflict, climate change and economic shocks are all driving the rises in hunger, the WFP said, with those pressures on food security compounded by steep price increases for basic foods this year. Global maize prices have soared almost 90% year-on-year, while wheat prices are up almost 30% over the same period. In many countries, currency depreciation is adding to these pressures and driving prices even higher. This in turn is stoking food insecurity in countries such as Lebanon, Nigeria, Sudan, Venezuela and Zimbabwe, said the WFP statement. The WFP needs about $6 billion to provide 139 million people this year with life-saving food and nutritional assistance, it said, in what the UN agency describes as the biggest operation in its history.",23/06/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/23/africa/madagascar-food-crisis-climate-change-famine-intl/index.html
Britain still lacks a plan to hit its bold climate goals,"The United Kingdom will fail to meet its historic climate promises if the government doesnt urgently put policies in place to reach its goal of decarbonizing the economy, according to its official climate watchdog. The Climate Change Committee, which advises the government on emissions targets, warned Thursday in its annual progress report that Prime Minister Boris Johnsons government is falling short of its rhetoric on the climate crisis. This defining year for the UKs climate credentials has been marred by uncertainty and delay to a host of new climate strategies, it said in a statement. Those that have emerged have too often missed the mark. With every month of inaction, it is harder for the UK to get on track. The report comes just months before Britain hosts the 26th UN Climate Change Conference (COP26), at which countries are expected to come up with commitments that will limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Alok Sharma, president of COP26 and a member of Johnsons cabinet, told CNN in April that he wanted countries to set out their plans in detail. The United Kingdom has positioned itself as a climate leader. It was the first major economy to pass laws  in 2019  requiring the country to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Last year, the UK announced a ban on the sale of new gasoline and diesel cars from 2030, bringing forward a previous deadline by five years and setting one of the most aggressive targets in the world. But the committee found that these important statements of ambition have been undermined by delays to essential legislation and plans to decarbonize buildings, transport and domestic heating. A pattern has emerged of Government strategies that are later than planned and, when they do emerge, short of the required policy ambition, it said. The committee pointed to Johnsons 10-point plan for a green industrial revolution as another example of an ambitious declaration that has yet to be backed with firm policies. The Government must get real on delivery, chair of the Climate Change Committee Lord Deben said in the statement. Between now and COP26 the world will look for delivery, not promises, he added. In a statement, a UK government spokesperson challenged this sentiment and pointed to clear, tangible progress in areas such as wind power investment, carbon emissions trading and business pledges to become net zero by 2050 or sooner. Any suggestion we have been slow to deliver climate action is widely off the mark, the spokesperson said. Over the past three decades, we have driven down emissions by 44%  the fastest reduction of any G7 country  and set some of the most ambitious targets in the world for the future, whilst driving forward net zero globally through our COP26 presidency. The committee, which offered more than 200 policy recommendations in its reports, said the government still has time to address its shortcomings. There is still a window to make comprehensive plans, the committee said. It is absolutely critical that the new strategy is published before the COP26 climate summit, with clear policy plans, backed fully by the Treasury.",24/06/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/24/business/climate-change-committee-uk-progress/index.html
European Union enshrines net zero and emissions targets into law,"The European Council adopted a climate change law Monday that legally obliges its 27 nations to collectively slash greenhouse emissions by 55% by 2030  from 1990 levels  and to become a net-zero-emissions economy by 2050. The European Union and several other nations increased pledges to cut greenhouse gases and reach carbon neutrality at a virtual climate change summit hosted by US President Joe Biden in April. But there have been concerns over whether world leaders would win the backings of their parliaments to actually enshrine the pledges into law. Until Monday, only five countries had actually made their pledges legally binding, according to Climate Watch Data: The United Kingdom and New Zealand, as well as EU members Hungary, Luxembourg and France. Mondays approval of the package of policies is the final seal on the climate law, which the EUs parliament passed last week. The EU has been working toward this law since it launched its vision, under the European Green Deal, in 2019. I warmly welcome this final step of the adoption of the EUs very first climate law which enshrines into legislation the 2050 climate neutrality objective, said Portuguese Minister of Environment and Climate Action Joao Pedro Matos Fernandes in a statement. Portugal is currently holding the presidency of the EU. An agreement on the European climate law has been a priority for the Portuguese Presidency and I am glad that we have successfully brought it over the finishing line. Net zero is a scenario where the number of greenhouse gases emitted are no greater than the amount removed from the atmosphere, largely through a method known as carbon capture. Some scientists and environmentalists criticize net zero plans for relying too heavily on technology that isnt fully developed, arguing the world should be aiming to cut the use of fossil fuels entirely and aim for low- or zero-carbon economies. The new law seeks to limit its reliance on carbon capture by capping the amount to 225 megatons of carbon. It will also seek to become a negative carbon economy  where it removes more carbon from the atmosphere than it emits  after 2050. The European Commission also agreed to propose an intermediate climate target for 2040, if appropriate, within six months after a first global stocktake of emissions carried out under the Paris Agreement. The law states that a scientific board on climate change will be established to advise the EU on its policies. The current increase in pledges from the EU  as well as other countries, including the US and UK  are aimed at keeping average global temperature rises within 1.5 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial levels and well below 2 degrees. The International Panel of Climate Change paints a catastrophic picture in a 2-degree-rise scenario, where 1.7 billion more people experience severe heatwaves at least once every five years, sea levels rise by another 10 centimeters and coral reefs are all but wiped out, among other impacts. But some environmentalists have warned that even the more ambitious pledges do not go far enough, and are not enough to keep temperature rise to 1.5C.",28/06/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/28/europe/eu-climate-change-law-net-zero-intl/index.html
The Northwest heat wave is ?nprecedented.?Here? what? pushing it into uncharted territory.,"As temperatures surged past 100 degrees, Bree Oswill gathered all the blankets and towels she could find and taped them to every window that didnt have a shade. She doesnt have central air conditioning and wanted to prevent every bit of sunlight and heat from entering her home. Growing up in Portland, Oregon, Oswill has become more concerned about the extreme weather changes from wildfires to heat waves shes seeing year after year. The 44-year-old mother of two likens it to a pandemic, but never-ending. Its like a lockdown, but were not going to solve it by putting on a mask or getting a vaccine, Oswill told CNN. Its just sort of perpetual. Its scary. A historic heat wave is searing much of the Pacific Northwest, and it is not yet July  a month when Oswill and many Portland residents typically experience the hottest days of the year. Portland set an all-time, record-high temperature three days in a row, topping out at 116 degrees on Monday. Seattle hit 108 degrees, besting the all-time record it set just a day earlier. Across the border, Lytton, British Columbia registered 117.5 degrees on Monday  the highest temperature ever recorded in Canada, and around 48 degrees above whats normal for this time of year. Kristina Dahl, a senior climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, says the heat wave is unprecedented. We saw heat records over the weekend only to be broken again the next day, Dahl told CNN, particularly for a part of the country where this type of heat does not happen very often. Michael E. Mann, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University, put it very simply: climate change is making heat waves more frequent and more intense. You warm up the planet, youre going to see an increased incidence of heat extremes, Mann told CNN. Experts like Dahl and Mann say climate change is reshaping the planets weather patterns. As humans emit more planet-warming greenhouse gas into the atmosphere, more energy is added to the climate system. The excess energy, according to Kristie Ebi, a climate and health researcher at the University of Washington, appears by way of extreme weather events. Heat waves have always occurred and will always occur, but weve got a very different pattern of heat waves now than we did a couple of decades ago, Ebi told CNN. And its not just the intensity, its also the geographic extent. In the opposite end of the country, over 40 million people in the Northeast US are also under heat advisories, including the New York, Philadelphia and Boston metropolitan areas. Though the heat wont be as bad as Oregon and Washington, records for the date could be set in the Northeast before temperatures cool off on Thursday. Extreme heat is of the deadliest consequences of climate change, killing more people than any other weather related event. Kate Weinberger, an environmental epidemiologist at the University of British Columbia, analyzed the number of deaths related to extreme heat in the US each year. A 2020 study, on which Weinberger was lead author, found an underestimated number of heat-related deaths in the country, since records typically only look at medical terms such as heat stroke, and neglects other potentially heat-related causes of death, like heart attacks. Heat likely contributes to many more deaths from causes other than heat stroke, because heat can exacerbate other chronic diseases, such as heart and lung conditions, Weinberger told CNN. Given the danger posed by heat, events like the ongoing heat wave in the Pacific Northwest need to be taken very seriously. Officials in Multnomah County, home to Portland, told CNN as of Monday morning there were at least 43 heat-related emergency department and urgent care clinic visits in the county on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The sheriffs office said Monday that ambulances are stretched thin due to demand. Normally we would expect about 1 or 2 visits for heat illness in the same time period, Kate Yeiser, communications coordinator for Multnomah County, told CNN in an email. The visits this weekend alone represent nearly half the heat illness visits we typically see during an entire summer. One appalling aspect of heat-related deaths in the US is the number of premature mortalities brought by heat exposure, particularly among babies and children left unattended in cars. A 2020 study published in the journal GeoHealth, which Ebi co-authored, found large increases in the number of premature deaths in the US each year due to heat exposure as the planet warms. Many dont understand how fast cars heat up and how babies physiology cant tolerate that, Ebi said. Ensuring that people are really aware about protecting babies and children during these heat waves is important. To understand how the climate crisis is changing the playing field, Mann suggests thinking of weather events on a bell curve. The highest point of the curve is where the most common weather takes place and the tails are where the extreme events lie. A warming planet shifts the bell curve to the right, pushing the already-extreme events into uncharted territory. Mann says that climate models, which predict general global conditions well into the future, can well-capture the shift and predict increases in extreme heat. But, he said, they do not paint a full picture of the impacts of climate change during the summer. This is an area where current generation models are not capturing a real-world climate connection, said Mann, who was also the lead author of a study that shows climate change is causing the summers jet stream  fast-flowing air currents in the upper atmosphere that influence day to day weather  to behave oddly. In that sense, climate models are actually underestimating the impact that climate change is having on events like the unprecedented heat wave were witnessing out West right now, Mann added. Climate change can cause the jet stream to get locked into a static wave pattern during the summer. Daniel Swain, a climate researcher at the University of California at Los Angeles, says this is best illustrated by flicking a jump rope up and down until its waves seem to stand still. Similarly in the atmosphere, high and low pressure systems can get stuck, creating extreme weather events like severe heat, drought or wildfires. Thats what happened in the Pacific Northwest this weekend, where a so-called heat dome, a strong ridge of high pressure, acts as a lid on the atmosphere. The lid traps the hot air trying to escape, and warms it even more as it sinks. Even if the jet stream does what it historically used to do, with no specific climate change contributions, climate change is still dramatically increasing the likelihood of these extreme heat events, Swain told CNN. If you warm the atmosphere, youd expect those heat waves to be hotter than they otherwise would have been. If the US fails to slash planet-warming emissions and improve climate adaptation systems, climate experts say people across the US and around the world are going to experience more severe impacts of extreme heat. By the middle of this century  2036 to 2065  vast swaths of the US that dont typically experience extreme heat such as the upper Midwest region and New England are set to face severe heat on a regular basis, according to a study from the Union of Concerned Scientists which Dahl co-authored. When we look at where were heading in the future, our analysis has shown that if we fail to reduce our heat-trapping emissions, we are poised to see a staggering expansion of dangerous heat across the US, Dahl told CNN. But, she adds, if the US aggressively reduces emissions as well as limit future global warming to 2-degrees Celsius, we can spare millions of people in the US and many more around the world from relentless summer heat.",28/06/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/28/weather/heat-waves-climate-change/index.html
?e have to act and act fast:?Biden says climate change is driving wildfires and historic heat wave,"President Joe Biden on Wednesday said climate change is driving an increased threat from wildfires as he announced new federal response plans during a meeting with governors from western states facing a record-breaking heat wave. Right now we have to act and act fast. Were late in the game here, Biden said at the White House. The President said: The truth is were playing catch up. This is an area that has been under resourced, but thats going to change if we have anything to do with it. We cant cut corners when it comes to managing our wildfires or supporting our firefighters, Biden said. The meeting comes as the western United States boils under extreme heat that has broken records in the Pacific Northwest and put millions of Americans in danger of heat-related health issues. Just this week, Portland, Oregon, set an all-time, record-high temperature three days in a row, topping out at 116 degrees on Monday. Seattle hit 108 degrees, besting the all-time record it set just a day earlier. Democratic governors from Oregon, California, New Mexico, Colorado and Nevada attended the meeting, along with the Republican governors of Wyoming and Utah. Climate change is driving the dangerous confluence of extreme heat and prolonged drought. Were seeing wildfires of greater intensity that move with more speed and last well beyond traditional months, traditional months of the fire season, Biden said. This wildfire season, Biden said, is already outpacing last season in terms of the number of large fires. The President announced new initiatives to ensure that federal firefighters do not make less than $15 an hour this year. Permanent federal firefighters working on the front lines paid at up to a GS-9 level will receive up to a 10% retention incentive and temporary workers who commit to continue this season would receive a $1000 Spot/Star Award this year, the White House said. Last week, I learned that some of our federal firefighters are being paid less than $13 an hour. Come on, man. Thats unacceptable, Biden said, adding that he believed $15 was still not enough. A senior administration official said while it will be in effect a pay raise for federal firefighters, it will come in the form of bonuses while the administration works with Congress to get a better deal long term, because firefighters must be fairly paid for the grueling and risky work that theyre willing to take on. Other response initiatives will include extending seasonal hiring, adding surge capacity by training and equipping additional personnel, and adding fire detection resources. The administration will be using satellite and emerging technologies to rapidly detect new fires. Biden noted wildfires are not a partisan phenomenon and dont stop at a county or a state line. We need a coordinated, comprehensive response with all the federal working, all the federal government working in close cooperation to support you, the states, Biden said. The White House said the bipartisan infrastructure framework that was agreed on last week would invest nearly $50 billion to build resilience to wildfires and help western communities prepare for droughts. Last year marked the worst wildfire season in California state history, which scientists and California authorities blamed on the climate crisis. Other Western states have also struggled, including Arizona, which along with California, has already seen evacuations due to wildfires this year.

Climate scientists say building collapse is a ?ake-up call?about the potential impact of rising seas,"As rescue and recovery teams dig through the rubble of the collapsed condo building in Surfside, Florida, scientists and engineers are starting to consider what could have possibly caused the deadly tragedy. Among a long list of hypotheses: climate change. Sea level rise, higher storm surges and more frequent high-tide flooding are deteriorating coastal infrastructure above and below ground. Officials are still very early in their investigation into what caused the collapse, and initial signs point to potential issues at the base of the building, perhaps in its foundation, columns or underground parking garage. But some engineers are considering whether increasing exposure to saltwater could have played a role in weakening the buildings foundation or internal support system. At the very least, experts say even the possibility should be a wake-up call to vulnerable communities across the United States: Climate change isnt a far-future threat; its happening now, and with potentially deadly consequences. Florida is one of the states most vulnerable to climate change. Sea level in the Miami area, including Surfside, has risen roughly 7 to 8 inches since Champlain Towers South was built 40 years ago, according to Brian McNoldy, a climate and weather researcher at the University of Miami. McNoldy has lived in Miami for more than nine years and has seen the impact of high-tide flooding, also referred to as nuisance flooding or King Tide floods. There are days where I have to adjust my route to work, because the route that I might normally take is inches of saltwater, he told CNN. And I dont want to drive my car through it. Virginia Key, a barrier island off the Miami coast, experienced 9 days of high-tide flooding in 2019, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which was an annual record for the location. Some low-lying places that maybe didnt use to flood are starting to now, and places that maybe always did have some issues during exceptionally high-tides have even worse issues now, McNoldy told CNN. William Espinosa, a former maintenance manager at the Champlain Towers South building from 1995 to 2000, was concerned about the amount of saltwater that made its way into the buildings underground garage, according to CNN-affiliate WFOR. Any time that we had high tides away from the ordinary, any King Tide or anything like that, we would have a lot of saltwater come in through the bottom of the of the foundation, Espinosa told WFOR. But it was so much water, all the time, that the pumps never could keep up with it. Im talking about a foot, sometimes two feet of water in the bottom of the parking lot, the whole parking lot, he added. In a letter obtained by CNNs Erin Burnett OutFront, Champlain Towers South Board President Jean Wodnicki wrote to residents in April describing the buildings worsening decay since a 2018 engineering report warned of design flaws and deteriorating infrastructure. The observable damage such as in the garage has gotten significantly worse since the initial (2018) inspection, Wodnicki wrote. The concrete deterioration is accelerating. The roof situation got much worse, so extensive roof repairs had to be incorporated. Hamed Moftakhari, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Alabama, said that South Florida experiences nuisance flooding, or high-tide flooding, on a regular basis. Higher sea levels increase flood hazards and vulnerability, exposing critical infrastructure to saltwater. Higher sea level increases the amount of saltwater building foundations are exposed to, Moftakhari told CNN. Infrastructure like roads and foundations are not designed to be inundated by saltwater a couple of hours a day. Ben Schafer, a structural engineer at Johns Hopkins University said sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion  where underground seawater moves farther inland  typically threatens older coastal buildings like Champlain Towers South. The life of the structure would be greatly shortened, Schafer told CNN. Its a corrosive environment. Its not favorable for concrete or steel, which are your primary building materials. Eighteen other coastal locations in addition to the Miami region broke records for high-tide flooding in 2019, including Annapolis, Maryland, where 18 days of high water disrupted transportation and parking in the downtown area, according to NOAA. Charleston, South Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia, each reported 13 days in 2019. As climate change-driven sea-level rise accelerates, worsening tidal floods will put millions of coastal homes and businesses worth more than $1 trillion today at risk by the end of the century, according to a 2018 report by the Union of Concerned Scientists. Erika Spanger-Siegfried, a senior analyst at UCS and co-author of the report, was careful not to blame climate change for the collapse. But, she said, it is a consequence that can be anticipated when sea-level rise is undermining the very ground that structures are built on. We really shouldnt need catastrophes like this to be a wake-up call, said Spanger-Siegfried. (Tidal) flooding is giving us that gentle nudge on a regular basis, because of climate change that this is what coastal regions can expect in the future. The areas flooded during high tides now will be the first to go permanently underwater, Spanger-Siegfried said. Impacts like high-tide flooding are what lawmakers should take into consideration, Spanger-Siegfried said, as Congress debates what should be included in the infrastructure package, a multibillion-dollar bill in which the Biden administration hopes to secure funds to combat the climate crisis in the US and fortify its infrastructure against future risk. She said, its simply foolish to make investments in infrastructure without considering that we already have a lot of climate change in the pipeline. Schafer says that although climate change is already upon us, we have yet to do very much about it. People are still imagining that it will move slow, he said. The problem is much, much larger, and we need to be thinking much more broadly about how we equitably evacuate ourselves from some areas that wont be available to us here in not so many years. As more parts of the world feel the dire impacts of climate change, Schafer says civil engineers such as himself also need to rethink how buildings are designed and how older buildings need to be reassessed to adapt to these changes. I dont think weve owned up even to the scale of the problem, Schafer said. If you look at the median sea-level rise predictions and project that onto city maps, the scale of what we need to do is so far beyond the scale of what were so far considering.",30/06/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/30/us/florida-building-collapse-sea-level-rise/index.html
"Modern elephants survived ancient climate change. More than 180 other species, including mastodons, didn?","The elephants we know and love today may be the ultimate survivors. While there are only three species of elephants now  all of which are endangered and can be found across Africa and Asia  they once belonged to a group called proboscideans that included 185 species living around the world. In the past, researchers have blamed humans for hunting these animals to extinction thousands of years ago. But new research suggests that climate change is the likely culprit in the demise of prehistoric mammoths, mastodons and early elephants rather than overhunting by early humans at the end of the last Ice Age. Waves of extreme global climate change chipped away at the proboscideans over time, eventually causing most of them to go extinct in different parts of the world between 2 million and about 75,000 years ago, the researchers said. The study published Thursday in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution. The international group of palaeontologists created a detailed data set analyzing the rise, evolution and fall of the 185 different proboscidean species, which took place over the course of 60 million years and began in North Africa. In order to track these elephants and their ancestors, the researchers studied global fossil collections and focused on traits like body size, skull shape, tusks and teeth. Remarkably for 30 million years, the entire first half of proboscidean evolution, only two of the eight groups evolved, said Zhang Hanwen, study coauthor and Honorary Research Associate at the University of Bristols School of Earth Sciences, in a statement. Most proboscideans over this time were nondescript herbivores ranging from the size of a pug to that of a boar. A few species got as big as a hippo, yet these lineages were evolutionary dead-ends. They all bore little resemblance to elephants. That all changed 20 million years ago, when a migration corridor that opened up at the Afro-Arabian tectonic plate pushed into the Eurasian continent. This allowed elephants and their predecessors to live in new environments, first in Eurasia and then North America by crossing the Bering Land Bridge  a strip of land that once connected Asia and North America. Moving out of Africa exposed the elephants to habitats, changing climates and the need for adaptation. The aim of the game in this boom period of proboscidean evolution was adapt or die, Zhang said. Habitat perturbations were relentless, pertained to the ever-changing global climate, continuously promoting new adaptive solutions while proboscideans that didnt keep up were literally, left for dead. The once greatly diverse and widespread mastodonts were eventually reduced to less than a handful of species in the Americas, including the familiar Ice Age American mastodon. As Earth experienced ice ages, the elephants had to adapt: The woolly mammoth, for example, had giant tusks that could plow beneath snow in search of food and a thick, shaggy coat. We discovered that the ecological diversity of proboscideans increased drastically once they dispersed from Africa to Eurasia 20 million years ago and to North America 16 million years ago, when land connections between these continents formed, said Juha Saarinen, study coauthor and postdoctoral researcher in the department of geosciences and geography at the University of Helsinki. While diversity initially increased after these events, that began to fall between 3 and 6 million years ago as the global climate cooled. The ecologically most versatile proboscideans, mostly true elephants which were adapted to consuming various plant resources, survived, Saarinen said. The extinction peaks for proboscideans started around 2.4 million, 160,000 and 75,000 years ago for Africa, Eurasia and the Americas, respectively, according to the researchers. It is important to note that these ages do not demarcate the precise timing of extinctions, but rather indicate the points in time at which proboscideans on the respective continents became subject to higher extinction risk, said Juan Cantalapiedra, lead study author and Senior Research Fellow at the University of Alcala in Spain, in a statement. These times dont line up with when early humans began to branch out and hunt giant herbivores, because it largely predates such advances. We didnt foresee this result, Zhang said. Conservatively, our data refutes some recent claims regarding the role of archaic humans in wiping out prehistoric elephants, ever since big game hunting became a crucial part of our ancestors subsistence strategy around 1.5 million years ago. Chris Widga, paleontologist and head curator at the Gray Fossil Site and Museum at East Tennessee State University, believes this research points to how important it is to track the evolutionary history of animal groups over longer time scales. Widga was not affiliated with this study. Those of us who study extinctions are usually most concerned with when and where the last of a certain species blips out, Widga said. In order to understand whether the final extinction of some of these proboscidean groups was significant, we need to know something about background extinction rates that occur in response to global ecological and climate changes. This paper shows how proboscideans responded to broad-scale climate changes and how they diversified ecologically to fill new niches. And because proboscideans have such an outsized impact on their surroundings  this is a big deal. This research also suggests that while 185 different proboscidean species have been identified with more than 2,000 fossil locations around the world, there may have been more. As if we needed more encouragement to find and describe more fossil proboscideans, Widga said. The study authors note that overhunting by humans may have served as a final double jeopardy after proboscideans already suffered harsh, changing climates long before. This isnt to say we conclusively disproved any human involvement, Zhang said. In our scenario, modern humans settled on each landmass after proboscidean extinction risk had already escalated. An ingenious, highly adaptable social predator like our species could be the perfect black swan occurrence to deliver the coup de grace.",02/07/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/02/world/mastodons-elephants-climate-change-scn/index.html
"Unprecedented heat, hundreds dead and a town destroyed. Climate change is frying the Northern Hemisphere","The tiny town of Lytton has come to hold a grim record. On Tuesday, it experienced Canadas highest-ever temperature, in an unprecedented heat wave that has over a week killed hundreds of people and triggered more than 240 wildfires across British Columbia, most of which are still burning. Lytton hit 49.6 degrees Celsius (121.3 degrees Fahrenheit), astounding for the town of just 250 people nestled in the mountains, where June maximum temperatures are usually around 25 degrees. This past week, however, its nights have been hotter than its days usually are, in a region where air conditioning is rare and homes are designed to retain heat. Now fires have turned much of Lytton to ash and forced its people, as well as hundreds around them, to flee. Scientists have warned for decades that climate change will make heat waves more frequent and more intense. That is a reality now playing out in Canada, but also in many other parts of the Northern Hemisphere that are increasingly becoming uninhabitable. Roads melted last week in Americas Northwest, and residents in New York City were told not to use high-energy appliances, like washers and dryers  and painfully, even their air conditioners  for the sake of the power grid. In Russia, Moscow reported its highest-ever June temperature of 34.8 degrees on June 23, and Siberian farmers are scrambling to save their crops from dying in an ongoing heat wave. Even in the Arctic Circle, temperatures soared into the 30s. The World Meteorological Organization is seeking to verify the highest-ever temperature north of the Arctic Circle since records there began, after a weather station in Siberias Verkhoyansk recorded a 38-degree day on June 20. In India, tens of millions of people in the northwest were affected by heat waves. The Indian Meteorological Department on Wednesday classified the capital, New Delhi, and cities in its surrounds as experiencing severe extreme heat, with temperatures staying consistently in the 40s, more than 7 degrees higher than usual, it said. The heat, along with a late monsoon, is also making life difficult for farmers in areas like the state of Rajasthan. And in Iraq, authorities announced a public holiday across several provinces for Thursday, including the capital Baghdad, because it was simply too hot to work or study, after temperatures surpassed 50 degrees and its electricity system collapsed. Experts who spoke with CNN said it was difficult to pinpoint exactly how linked these weather events are, but its unlikely a coincidence that heat waves are hitting several parts of the Northern Hemisphere at the same time. The high pressure systems were seeing in Canada and the United States, all of these systems are driven by something called the jet stream  a band of very strong winds that sits way above our heads, at about 30,000 feet where the planes fly around, Liz Bentley, chief executive at the UKs Royal Meteorological Society, told CNN. Bentley explained the configuration of the jet stream is preventing weather systems from moving efficiently along their normal west-to-east path. That jet stream has become wavy, and its got stuck in what we call an Omega block, because its got the shape of the Greek letter Omega, and when it gets in that, it doesnt move anywhere, it blocks it, Bentley said. So the high pressure thats been building just gets stuck for days or weeks on end, and these Omegas appear in different parts of the Northern Hemisphere. In the US, the same thing happened in mid-June in the Southwest, breaking records in Mexico and places like Phoenix in Arizona. A couple weeks later, a dome of high pressure built over the Northwest, toppling records in Washington, Oregon and southwest Canada. So weve seen these unprecedented temperatures  records being broken not just by a few degrees, being absolutely smashed, Bentley said. There is a growing acceptance among some political leaders that climate change is a driving force behind fueling many extreme weather events, particularly for heat waves and storms. Climate change is driving the dangerous confluence of extreme heat and prolonged drought, US President Joe Biden said Wednesday. Were seeing wildfires of greater intensity that move with more speed and last well beyond traditional months, traditional months of the fire season. Scientists are working on sophisticated tools that can rapidly assess just how much climate change may have contributed to a particular weather event. We carried out a quick attribution study to get some fast answers to What is the role of climate change? said UK Met Office meteorologist, Nikos Christidis, who has been developing simulations to carry out such analysis. We found that without human influence, it would be almost impossible to hit a new record and such a hot June in the region, he said, referring to an area including those affected in Canada and the US. Christidis said in the past, without human-caused climate change, extreme heat in the northwest US or southwest Canada would have occurred once every tens of thousands of years. Presently, it can occur every 15 years or so, Christidis said. And if greenhouse gas emissions continue? Christidis said as often as every year or two by the turn of the century. Several countries, including the US, United Kingdom and those in the European Union, recently increased their commitments  some by a long way  but many scientists and activists say they still dont go far enough to keep global average temperatures within 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. World leaders pledged in the 2015 Paris Agreement to aim for this limit to stave off the more most catastrophic impacts of climate change. Climate groups have also urged Canada to increase its commitments and wean itself off oil and gas. This is literally the deadliest weather on record for the US Pacific Northwest and far southwest Canada region. The losses and the despair as a result of the extreme heat and devastating fires in Canada are a reminder of whats yet come as this climate crisis intensifies, said Eddy Perez, Climate Action Network Canadas manager for international climate diplomacy. Canada is experiencing historic climate-induced losses and damages while at the same time not doing its fair share to combat dangerous climate change. As an oil and gas producer, Canada is still considering the expansion of fossil fuels which is directly attributed to the global temperature rise.",04/07/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/04/world/canada-us-heatwave-northern-hemisphere-climate-change-cmd-intl/index.html
"Dragonflies are losing their wing color because of climate change, study shows","As the planet warms, a study found that male dragonflies are losing a crucial feature they typically use to attract female mates: the ornate black patterns on their wings. The new research published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that male dragonflies are adapting to a warming climate by shedding more of their darker wing patterns. Researchers worry that female species may no longer recognize their male counterparts without their intricate wing patterns and, thus, wont be able to reproduce as temperatures get hotter. Our research shows that males and females of these dragonfly species are going to shift in pretty different ways as the climate changes, Michael Moore, lead author of the study and an evolutionary biologist at Washington University in St. Louis, told CNN. These changes are going to happen likely on a much faster timescale than the evolutionary changes in these species have ever occurred before. Moore and his colleagues analyzed a database of more than 300 dragonfly species across the US, Canada and northern Mexico, and cross-referenced the wing colors of roughly 2,700 individual dragonflies from different species across different locations and climate. According to a study Moore co-authored in 2019, male dragonflies with darker wing patterns thrive under colder conditions, whereas warmer conditions dramatically reduce their performance. The latest study highlights that male dragonflies adapted to warmer temperatures by evolving less melanin on their wing patterns. Evolutionary changes and wing coloration are a really consistent way that dragonflies adapt to their climates, he said. This got us wondering what the role of evolutionary changes in wing coloration might be as dragonflies respond to the rise in global temperatures. A darker wing coloration is a crucial mating trait for male dragonflies, enticing female mates. But just as dark roads absorb the suns heat, dark wing pigments increase the dragonflies body temperatures by up to 2 degrees Celsius, damaging their wing tissue, overheating them and reducing their defense abilities  all of which pose deadly ramifications for the insects. Moore likens it to wearing black clothing on a sunny, hot day: its going to make you feel hotter. The findings, however, only apply to male dragonflies. Female dragonflies respond less to climate changes, and when they do, its usually the opposite way as male dragonflies. The reason, Moore says, remains unknown. We dont yet know whats driving these evolutionary changes in female wing coloration, he said. But one of the very important things that this indicates is that we shouldnt assume that males and females are going to respond to climatic conditions in exactly the same way. The disparate evolution between the two, researchers say, pose challenges when it comes to mating or breeding. In a 14-year period, from 2005 to 2019, Moore and his colleagues analyzed which dragonflies make it to the breeding stages and discovered that natural selection has prevented ornamented male dragonflies from breeding in warmer years, compared to cooler years. The studys climate projections also show that changes in dragonfly wing coloration will be a crucial aspect in seeing how the species would respond to warming temperatures over the next 50 years, predicting more decreases by 2070. Its not just dragonflies, according Scott Black, executive director of the Xerces Society, a nonprofit conservation group that protects insect habitats. This is evolution and adaptation in real time, but will they be able to adapt quickly enough? Black, who is not involved with the study, told CNN. The climate crisis is happening at a speed that is really unprecedented in human history. Its all of these animals potentially adapting to be able to move to a climate or habitats that are able to support them. Black also said that adaptation alone will not help these species if they do not have enough water, in which their nymphs depend on to grow to adulthood. With large parts of the Western US facing record-breaking heat waves and drought while much of the Northeast region are under heat advisories, its clear that historic temperatures and climate impacts are taking a toll on various species and ecosystems including dragonflies. We must work on nature-based climate solutions, including wetland protection and restoration, to maintain this important biodiversity, Black said. Dragonflies are very important because they eat insects like mosquitoes so this is not just about dragonflies but disrupting the entire ecosystem. Meanwhile, Moore adds that climate and land management policies shouldnt just focus on how species will survive, but also how they can continue to mate and reproduce to create a lasting population as climate change shifts habitats and ecosystems. What our research shows strongly is that as we make these recommendations to folks who work on policy and land management, he said, we need to make sure that they understand that these organisms also need reproduce and not just survive.",06/07/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/06/us/dragonfly-wings-climate-change/index.html
"Historic Northwest heat wave ?irtually impossible?without human-caused climate crisis, study finds","Hundreds dead in a historic heat wave. A Canadian village burned to the ground. Water shortages. Animals competing for food. The culprit? Humans, according to climate change scientists. The unprecedented heat wave in the Pacific Northwest in late June would have been virtually impossible without the influence of human-caused climate change, according to an analysis by more than two dozen scientists at World Weather Attribution. Every extreme heat event has the fingerprints of climate change on them, the authors wrote, but the unprecedented heat in late June  which set all-time records in Oregon, Washington and British Columbia  was made particularly possible by warming caused by fossil fuel emissions, the analysis concluded. Though the temperatures were far outside the range of past observed temperatures, leaving little to compare to, the scientists determined the late-June heat wave was 150 times more likely because of climate change. A decade ago, researchers would have been hesitant to point to climate change for any single event. Now, with the aid of high-powered computer models, researchers can use decades of observed temperatures to rapidly determine what role Earths warming played. Our results provide a strong warning: our rapidly warming climate is bringing us into uncharted territory that has significant consequences for health, well-being, and livelihoods, the authors wrote. The late-June heat event raises serious questions whether we really understand how climate change is making heat waves hotter and more deadly, said Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, a researcher at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute. Officials in Oregon said Wednesday the heat wave was a mass casualty event consistent with worst-case climate models. State officials have reported 116 deaths in Oregon from the heat wave, and at least 57 more in Washington state. The unprecedented heat dome that settled over the region for nearly five days between June 25 and June 30 was a mass casualty event, according to Multnomah County, home to the city of Portland. On June 28 alone, the countys medical examiner experienced four times the typical number of deaths, the county said. The number of people and infrastructure harmed by this event is consistent with worst-case climate models for the Pacific Northwest and predict there is worse to come in the absence of aggressive global action to stop the use of fossil fuels, John Wasiutynski, Multnomah Countys sustainability director, said in a statement. Hundreds of others were also reported dead from the unrelenting heat in British Columbia, which set a record for Canadas all-time highest temperature: 121.3 degrees Fahrenheit (49.6 degrees Celsius) in the town of Lytton, which was almost completely destroyed by a wildfire just days later. Lytton Mayor Jan Polderman told CNN affiliate CTV News that within minutes on Wednesday, there was fire everywhere, leaving no time to knock on doors and tell people to evacuate. In California, rainfall is at an all-time low, fueling concerns about a devastating wildfire season. On June 30, when the state ended its rainfall year, California recorded a statewide average of just 23.61 inches of precipitation, marking its driest year since records began in 1895. The rainfall total is less than half  49%  of the states typical annual accumulation, which is measured from the beginning of July to the end of June each year. Jan Null, a former National Weather Service meteorologist in the San Francisco Bay Area, first reported the rainfall year record on Wednesday, citing data from the Western Region Climate Center. Benjamin Hatchett, a climatologist at the center, noted that the 2020-2021 period was not only the states driest rainfall year, but also the second warmest year on record, making for a dire situation. We get a large fraction of our water from the runoff that the snowmelt provides, Hatchett told CNN. He added that the extraordinary conditions have also primed much of the state for wildfires. Basically, every part of California is ready to burn at this point, he said. All it takes is one mistake. Vast swaths of the West remain in a historic and unrelenting drought, the worst in the region in at least 20 years. Drought conditions as of Thursday expanded and worsened in the West, especially in the Pacific Northwest, after another week of hot and dry weather, according to the US Drought Monitor. More than 93% of the West is in drought, the highest on record, with nearly 60% in extreme or exceptional drought, the two most severe categories. There are five states completely in drought conditions; California, Oregon, Nevada, Utah and North Dakota. Exceptional drought in Oregon expanded, according to the US Drought Monitor, which said the states current conditions are among the driest since the late 1800s. In Washington, rangeland and pasture conditions are far worse this year when compared to all other years this century. Data from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection shows the state is far exceeding the disastrous 2020 fire year in both the number of wildfires and land burned. As of July 4, more than 114 square miles have been scorched statewide, an area more than twice as large as at the same time last year, when California went on to record its worst fire season ever. Peter Fickenscher, a hydrologist at the National Weather Service California-Nevada River Forecast Center, told CNN that the state experiencing a second straight year of extremely dry conditions has made the situation much more severe and warned that if it does not receive significant rain in the coming year, extreme measures to conserve water will be necessary.",08/07/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/08/weather/climate-change-extreme-heat/index.html
"It? ?nescapable? Pacific Islanders have tried to flee the climate crisis, only to face new threats","Selina Neirok Leem grew up listening to the Pacific Ocean at her home in the Marshall Islands. She watched high tides wash over the islands seawalls, and her family trekked inland when the storm surge from tropical cyclones destroyed homes close to the shore. It was during those storms that Leems grandfather would force her family to retreat to higher ground, even as he insisted on staying behind to protect their home from the rising seas. I would always be so mad and terrified, because in my mind as a kid, I imagine all these horrible things happening, Leem told CNN of those moments, that I might not even see him tomorrow. The climate crisis has been thrashing the Pacific Islands, causing drought, coral reef bleaching, more powerful storms and sea level rise. Super Typhoon Yutu in 2018 left thousands in the US territories of Saipan and Tinian without homes, power and running water for months. At least 57 percent of the infrastructure in the Pacific Islands will be threatened by rising sea levels during this century, according to a United Nations report. With climate disasters increasing in frequency and intensity, many Pacific Islanders have chosen to leave their home islands to escape climate-related economic issues and health hazards. But where theyve settled, climate change is appearing in different  though just as devastating  ways. Around 30,000 people have moved to the US from the Marshall Islands, an independent nation about halfway between Australia and Hawaii. Washington, Oregon, and California are among the top destinations for Marshallese, according to researchers at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. The Western US isnt threatened by tropical cyclones, and its risk to sea level rise is comparatively lower than other parts of the United States. But climate change is exacting a toll there in the form of a devastating drought, a water crisis, deadly heat and the worst wildfires in millennia. As record-breaking heat engulfed the Pacific Northwest in late June, Marshallese migrants faced the challenges of working outdoor jobs and living in crowded, multi-generational homes, many of which dont have air conditioning. Steven Manaoakamai Johnson grew up in Saipan but now lives in Corvallis, Oregon, where the temperature spiked to 109 degrees in late June. Johnson described himself as a climate refugee of-sorts during the heat wave, fleeing to the coast where it was more than 30 degrees cooler. Climate change is not new for us Pacific Islanders, he told CNN. Weve unfortunately been dealing with this longer than many of our mainland counterparts. The Pacific Northwest heat wave would have been virtually impossible without human-caused climate change, according to an analysis published Wednesday in which more than two dozen scientists concluded the burning of fossil fuels made the heat wave at least 150 times more likely. With at least 116 heat-related deaths in Oregon and 57 more in Washington state, officials are calling it a mass casualty event. The most vulnerable to climate change will always be the most vulnerable, no matter if they can migrate or not, Johnson said. When a storm flattens your island and you have to take a job farming in Oregon, you are not any less vulnerable, since climate change is inescapable. Leem, who now lives with family in Spokane, was among the growing Pacific Islander community who endured the record-high temperatures. And since many in the Marshallese community also face language and cultural barriers, she has volunteered to help during extreme events. She described one Marshallese mother who gave birth in her home as temperatures soared to Washingtons all-time state record: I dont know how they did it, Leem said. The baby was just newly born, and they had to stay indoors that entire week under that heat wave. They had to move to the ground floor, since it was cooler than where they were in the second floor. A unique international agreement  the Compact of Free Association  allows Marshallese residents to live and work in the US under a special status. David Anitok, director of the COFA Alliance National Network of Washington, has been offering assistance to the Marshallese community in Everett, Washington, just north of Seattle, even as he and his family had to take advantage of a cooling center themselves. There were many families looking around for cooling spots, so we were able to locate and point them to a few whether its fire stations or libraries, Anitok, who is Marshallese, told CNN. Transportation was another big barrier for many of them, especially if its a multi-generational home and they only have one car to rely on, and that car is being used by someone for work. Anitok, along with his two kids, found relief from the heat at a nearby fire station serving as a cooling center, where he met with other Marshallese families. His organization also distributed water for Marshallese farm laborers who were working under searing conditions in the area. Theres still a sense of community, sticking together as best as possible, he said. But even then, there are still many families from the Marshall Islands that didnt get to these resources or know about them. It was definitely hard time. People were stressed and frustrated. Pacific Islander communities such as Samoans, Chamorro, Tongans, and Native Hawaiians who have settled in Washington and Oregon are becoming increasingly vocal about environmental issues. Last March, Anitok helped organize a virtual nuclear remembrance event, where Pacific Islanders spoke about the environmental injustice they faced after the US tested 67 nuclear bombs on the Marshall Islands between 1946 to 1958. In 2019, researchers found the Marshall Islands were more radioactive than Chernobyl and Fukushima. Islanders have fled because of the health impacts of the nuclear waste  corralled into a 3.1 million cubic foot dome which is threatened by rising seas. Those that remain in the country of scattered, low-lying atolls and islands are seeing worsening high tides, extreme heat and drought-stricken plantations. At the 2015 Paris Climate Conference (COP21), Leem spoke alongside former Marshall Islands foreign minister Tony deBrum, who, as a 9-year-old, witnessed the largest bomb detonated there by the US. As one of the youngest delegates at the summit, Leem delivered a passionate, urgent plea calling on world leaders to take stronger action on climate change and to act swiftly. Nearly six years of inaction later, she has witnessed unprecedented events from destructive wildfires to early heat waves. Theres definitely that fear, but we have to deal with overcoming that fear because you dont want to remain immobilized or numbed by it, Leem said. Its important to overcome it and work with solutions that we already have and how we can move forward to address this crisis.",08/07/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/08/us/pacific-islands-climate-change-refugees/index.html
Climate change is about greed. It? time for big oil to pay us back,"Four interconnected pieces of climate change-related news from the past two weeks reveal Americas predicament. And they also show the way forward, which ultimately must include oil companies paying restitution for damage that they have done to the climate and humanity for decades. The first of the four pieces of climate news is the deadly heat wave hitting the western US and Canada, killing hundreds to date. According to the United Nations, there has been a staggering increase in the frequency of such extreme climate events. The earth is now warmer than at any time in the past 12,000 years. The second is President Joe Bidens infrastructure plan. The Biden plan aims, in part, to join with other nations to build a new 21st-century infrastructure based on renewable energy, electric vehicles and other zero-carbon technologies in order to stop human-induced climate change. To achieve the global aim of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), the worlds energy system should be decarbonized by 2050, along the lines described in a recent report by the International Energy Agency on achieving net-zero by 2050. As usual, Republican leaders lined up against the parts of the plan aimed at reducing carbon emissions. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell declared, The total amount of funding it would direct to roads, bridges, ports, waterways and airports combined adds up to less than what it would spend just on electric cars, and that The far left sees a strong family resemblance between these proposals and their socialist Green New Deal. The GOP was joined by Democratic West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, whose campaigns are amply funded by the oil and gas industry and coal mining. The third is the wonderful new Greenpeace UK expose on ExxonMobil lobbying. Posing as a headhunter, a Greenpeace activist secretly videotaped Keith McCoy, an ExxonMobil lobbyist, explaining the tools of his trade. Did we aggressively fight against some of the science? Yes, McCoy said. Did we join some shadow groups to work against some of the early efforts? Yes, thats true. But theres nothing illegal about that. We were looking out for our investments. We were looking out for our shareholders. The lobbyist explained that ExxonMobils support for a carbon tax is just for show. Nobody is going to propose a tax on all Americans. The cynical side of me says we kind of know that. But it gives us a talking point. We can say, What is ExxonMobil for? Were for a carbon tax. Most importantly, the lobbyist compared lobbying to fishing for Congressmen. You kind of reel them in. Because theyre a captive audience. They know they need you and I need them. McCoy identified 11 US senators he says are crucial to Exxon and describes Manchin as the kingmaker. He said that he talked to his office every week  (Manchins office did not respond to CNNs request for comment.) McCoy apologized (though claimed some of his statements were taken out of context), while ExxonMobils CEO declared that the lobbyists comments in no way represent the companys position on climate policy and its commitment to carbon pricing. Yet Harvard researchers have argued that ExxonMobil has a record of misleading the public that goes back decades. The company has denied that too, claiming the study was activist-funded. ExxonMobils lobbying per se is not illegal. Thats part of the problem. We have a political system that promotes narrow corporate interests above the common good. By misleading the public over many decades, ExxonMobil has compounded the political failure. Even ExxonMobils shareholders are in revolt against the company managements disgusting resistance to reality. A hedge fund investor won a high-profile proxy fight this past spring to add three new members to the ExxonMobil board of directors who will advocate for the company to adopt a decarbonization policy. The hedge fund argued to the other shareholders that for ExxonMobil to continue down the path of carbon energy is a dead-end, a sure way to strand assets, and a majority agreed. The fourth is the European Unions consideration of plans to end the sales of oil-using internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles by 2035 and to replace them with electric and other zero-emission vehicles (such as hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles). In Europe, the oil-and-gas industry is much less powerful politically than in the United States. Recently, a Dutch court in The Hague ordered Royal Dutch Shell to slash the emissions from its products. The European Union as a whole is moving forward with a European Green Deal to decarbonize the EU energy system no later than 2050. In line with the European plans, Volkswagen recently declared its intention to phase out ICEs in Europe by 2035. As in so many areas of public life, America is suffering from a broken political system that sells public policies to the highest bidders and the best-organized lobbies. The oil and gas lobby gave nearly $140 million in campaign contributions in the 2020 election cycle, $75 million through individual and PAC contributions and the rest in soft money. Of the $75 million, $63 million, or 84%, went to Republican candidates. This is fishing for Congressmen, indeed. Yet as a result the companies are not merely making ill-gotten gains. Their products are killing fellow Americans and creating havoc worldwide. Its time for them to pay for this repeated, long-standing, knowing and shocking malfeasance. ExxonMobil and the other big oil companies owe not only a profound mea culpa to the world for pushing dangerous products, but also restitution for the damage they have caused. As with the drug companies that pushed addictive painkillers on Americans and tobacco companies that pushed killer cigarettes, its time for the oil industry to pay heavy penalties on ill-gotten gains, the flip side of which are the death and destruction caused by extreme climate events. ExxonMobil has a market capitalization of around $260 billion. These and other oil and gas companies should be charged a corporate income tax surcharge to reflect the social cost of carbon of their oil and gas products, now estimated to be around $51 per metric ton of CO2 emissions. Tax penalties should include damages from past emissions as well as ongoing production. Up till now, as a result of Americas pay-to-play politics, the companies have received tax benefits instead of paying tax surcharges. By charging an income-tax surcharge, the companies would not only pay restitution to society, but would face the incentive to change course before they create a complete disaster for the world. The funds raised by such a surcharge could then help to fund the modernization of infrastructure that America so desperately needs, including the shift to green technologies that protect the planet. America still has a chance to save itself. Biden is on the right course. In addition to the scaled-down bipartisan infrastructure agreement that strips out clean energy, the Democrats are planning a reconciliation bill that includes Bidens clean energy policy. The American people overwhelmingly support policies to limit climate change. Americas test, therefore, has come down to the question of honesty, honor and survival. Can we overcome corporate greed and a broken political system to save our nation and our world?",08/07/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/08/opinions/biden-climate-corporate-greed-infrastructure-sachs/index.html
Farmers like me want to join fight against climate change. But we need help,"The record drought scorching the western US  including my state, North Dakota  is becoming an all-too-familiar story. For farmers like me, it seems like nowadays we have more bad years than good. Every season brings another unprecedented catastrophe, affecting crops regionally or all around the country. Remember the record winter storm in Texas, only four months ago? It caused $600 million in agricultural losses, according to Texas A&M University. In addition to the current megadrought, which analysts describe as the worst in 1,200 years, in the past three years alone farmers have seen record floods in the Midwest, derecho storms that brought hurricane-force winds to Iowa and Illinois, and the largest ever wildfire season in California, not to mention other deluges, droughts and localized disasters that barely registered in the news cycle. The pace of disaster can be dizzying. Earlier this spring, even putting aside the drought, our farm experienced an unusually late frost that killed off 30% of our soybeans just as they were emerging from the soil, requiring us to replant. Within a week, local temperatures boomeranged back to nearly 100 degrees. While the agricultural sectors fate has always been tied to the weather, the severity of these events, as well as their increased frequency, makes it seem that climate change is having a hand in our weather patterns. The agricultural industry is often misunderstood by the general public, and we havent always been credited for being forward thinking on climate change. However today, more farmers recognize the evidence around us and are turning the tide. Data from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) also shows that farmers are increasingly implementing conservation practices that help mitigate climate change, although we still have a long way to go. One reason for this shift is that sustainable farming is in our best interest  its good for our bottom lines and for ensuring the lands viability for future generations. Farmers are finding that improved soil management can lead to higher and more consistent yields, while precision agricultural practices like soil testing and variable rate fertilize application can reduce bills for fertilizer and other inputs. On our farm, we use a number of conservation practices, and we keep up with the latest information from the agricultural extension services at North Dakota State University. We plant cover crops and practice no-till, minimum-till, and good water management to prevent erosion and preserve soil organic matter. We also do soil testing and use prescription fertilizer so that we only put down as much fertilizer as the crop is going to use  which reduces runoff and nitrogen emissions while also lowering our costs. Climate change is a daunting issue, but farmers can be part of the solution by implementing good practices. A recent report written by experts from Farm Journal Foundation and the Massachusetts Institute of Technologys Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change found that while agriculture contributes 10% of total US greenhouse gas emissions, existing climate-smart solutions  if put into wider use by farmers  could turn the industry into a net-carbon sink. Some examples of these solutions include expanding efficient fertilizer application, renewable energy use, feed additives to help livestock reduce methane, and more radical innovations like methane digesters, big steel tanks that capture natural gas from livestock manure. Cutting-edge agricultural research conducted at American universities is delivering new solutions all the time to help farmers adapt to and mitigate climate change. However, farmers often still face barriers to putting sustainable solutions into practice. For many, it comes down to costs. Farming is a business that runs on tight margins  we are affected not only by the weather but also by volatile commodity prices. Because of this, many dont have the start-up capital to invest in sustainability. We need incentives such as tax breaks, cost sharing, technical assistance or favorable loan terms for these investments to make financial sense. There are already several USDA programs that help farmers improve their sustainability  such as the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP), Rural Energy for America Program (REAP), and the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP). However, these programs are significantly underfunded, so not all farmers who apply actually receive assistance. According to a 2021 report by Farm Journal Foundation and MIT, only about 40% of EQIP projects received funding between 2000 and 2010. This is partly because of the focus on reducing federal spending, which has led to a tighter budget for EQIP. In addition, applications for technical assistance from local USDA conservation offices frequently have long wait times, according to the report. Under the 2018 farm bill, EQIP and CSP, for example, are provided with $1.8 billion and $750 million respectively for FY 2021. This only makes a dent in what farmers across the country need to implement sustainable agricultural measures. To enable more farmers to participate, the government needs to increase funding to these programs and others like them. It should also increase funding for agricultural research that helps farmers adapt to and mitigate climate change. In addition, Congress should pass the Growing Climate Solutions Act, which would, among other things, help the agriculture and forestry industries reduce greenhouse gas emissions by providing technical assistance for farmers to enroll in carbon-credit markets. The bill passed the Senate and is awaiting a House vote. Finally, government and industry groups need to do more to ensure that farmers are aware of the options that are available to them. Although conservation programs are in high demand, many farmers are busy with the day-to-day running of their businesses and dont find out about opportunities and incentives until after the programs are already full. Today, agriculture is an innovative, forward-looking industry, and farmers are putting more and more climate-smart solutions into practice. But to truly move the needle and secure a future for family farms like mine, the government needs to provide more support. Fighting climate change is a centerpiece of President Joe Bidens policy platform. My hope is that farmers can do their part to ensure a sustainable future for us all.",08/07/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/08/opinions/farmers-climate-change-fight-support-kummer/index.html
Climate change altered the size of human bodies,"The average body size of humans has fluctuated significantly over the last million years and is linked to a changing climate, according to research published Thursday. A team of researchers led by the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom and the University of Tubingen in Germany gathered measurements of brain and body size for more than 300 fossils from the Homo genus or family, to which modern day humans  Homo sapiens  belong. The team used this data, combined with a reconstruction of the Earths regional climates from the last million years, and calculated the climate that would have been experienced by each fossil when it was a living human. Researchers found that climate  particularly temperature  has been the main driver of changes in body size for the past million years. Colder, harsher climates were linked to larger bodies, while warmer climates were linked to smaller bodies, the team found. Larger bodies can buffer individuals from cold temperatures  the larger you are, the smaller your surface compared to your volume, so you conserve heat more efficiently, Andrea Manica, a professor of evolutionary ecology at the University of Cambridge, told CNN via email. This is a relationship that is found in many animals, and even among contemporary humans, but we now know that it was a major driver behind the changes in body size over the last million years. The research was published in the journal Nature Communications. Researchers also looked at the impact of environmental factors on brain size. Homo sapiens emerged around 300,000 years ago in Africa, but the Homo genus, which includes Neanderthals and other extinct, related species such as Homo habilis and Homo erectus, has existed for much longer. Experts said that compared to earlier species such as Homo habilis, we, Homo sapiens, are 50% heavier and our brains are three times larger  but the reasons behind such changes are still debated. The team found that climate did have a role in brain size, but there was so much variation in brain size that cant be explained by environmental changes. Interestingly, brain size changes were completely unrelated to temperature, so body and brain size evolved under distinct pressures, Manica explained. For brain size, we found that larger brains were found in stable environments  brains are expensive, so you cant sustain them if you lack resources. He added: For early Homo, there was also a tendency to develop bigger brains in more open habitats, where our ancestors would have been required to hunt large mammals. Importantly, however, climate explains changes in brain size much less than it does for body size. This means that other factors such as added cognitive challenges of ever more and complex social lives, more diverse diets, and more sophisticated technology were likely the main drivers of changes in brain size, he added. Manica thinks its unlikely that current climate change will dramatically impact our body sizes for now. The changes that we described have happened over thousands of years, or rather, tens of thousands of years, he explained. So a few years of climate change will do little to our bodies or brains. If we managed to keep changing the climate without destroying the whole planet for a long time  we are not doing too well in that regard  then maybe, but thankfully this is an issue we dont have to worry about for quite a while, he said. But still, climate change may already shrinking some of the planets animals. North American migratory birds have been getting smaller over the past four decades, and their wingspan wider. The changes appear to be a response to a warming climate, according to a 2019 study. In an analysis of 70,716 dead birds representing 52 species logged between 1978 and 2016, researchers found that 49 saw statistically significant declines in body size. The authors suggested that the shrinking body sizes are a response to climate warming, with temperatures at the birds summer breeding grounds north of Chicago increasing roughly 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) over the course of the study. And a 2011 study in the journal Nature Climate Change found that ectotherms  cold-blooded animals like toads, turtles, and snakes that rely on environmental heat sources  are already changing a lot as temperatures rise. Both aquatic and terrestrial ectotherms have been shrinking, according to the study, with common toads size and condition decreasing as temperatures rose 1.5 degrees Celsius over a 22-year period.",08/07/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/08/world/climate-change-body-size-intl-scli-scn/index.html
The West is caught in a vicious climate change feedback loop,"After a deadly, climate change-fueled heat wave smothered the Pacific Northwest at the end of June, historic heat threatens records once again, particularly in the drought-stricken Southwest region. More than 30 million people are under heat warnings and advisories. The National Weather Service says the risk level for this heat wave is very high  dangerous for not just those with underlying health issues, but the entire population, especially those who work outdoors. The overnights, which in some places will only drop to the mid-80s, will bring little relief. As temperatures climb to the triple digits, the sun will bake out what little moisture there is in the ground, worsening the Wests unprecedented drought. Scientists say heat and drought are inextricably linked in a vicious feedback loop that climate change makes even harder to break: heat exacerbates the drought, which in turn amps up the heat. As were getting these very extreme heat waves, its just making the drought even worse, even though drought is initially caused by the lack of precipitation, Julie Kalansky, a climate scientist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, told CNN. But during the dry months of much of the West, these heat waves just continue this drying throughout the summer and into the fall. More than 93% of the West is in drought this week, according to the US Drought Monitor, the largest area on record in that region. Nearly 60% of the west is in the two most-severe drought categories, extreme or exceptional. Three of the states entirely in drought conditions are also at the center of this weekends heat wave: California, Nevada and Utah. Death Valley in Southern California is forecast to reach 130 degrees or higher on Sunday and Monday, within stones throw of the hottest temperature ever recorded on the planet  134 degrees at the same location in 1913. Kern County, California, about a three-hour drive west of Death Valley, is expected to reach triple digits as well. Juan Flores grew up in a family of migrant farm workers in Kern. He worked in the grape fields in sweltering conditions on summer breaks, and remembers a previous extreme drought in 2011, when many migrant farm workers  including his parents  struggled economically. With the drought, youre going to have less crops, and because youre going to have less crops, youre going to need less people, Flores told CNN, and then all of a sudden, folks are going to be on unemployment benefits, but those benefits dont last forever. Although his parents are in a better economic situation, Flores said many migrant farm workers will still bear the brunt of climate change-fueled economic challenges as severe weather events become more frequent and more extreme. Weve got to talk about a national emergency, especially in Kern County, because were considered the fruit basket of the nation, said Flores, who is now a community organizer with the Center on Race, Poverty, and the Environment, a national environmental justice group. Kalansky said strong storms that draw moisture from the Pacific Ocean, often referred to as atmospheric rivers, are crucial in determining whether California is going to end up in drought. In the last two years, however, only one such storm brought precipitation to California this winter. During extended periods of heat, like what the West has endured this summer, dry air evaporates water from the soil, which worsens the drought  another reason water shortages are cropping up; not only has there not been enough rain to fill reservoirs, the air is leeching water from whats left of them. The heat and the water shortages hit farming communities from several angles. When you have high heat in these in agricultural communities, it can be very dangerous and hard to work outside too, Kalansky said. So thats kind of a double whammy. The farm labor market in the US depends heavily on immigrants with very few legal protections. An analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists found that from 2015 to 2016, only 24% of US farm workers were US citizens, while the remaining 76% were people of color. Many risked their lives crossing the border to escape climate-related challenges. Extreme heat and drought compounds the health hazards farm workers regularly face in the fields, including exposure to pesticides and respiratory illnesses like asthma. During the unrelenting Pacific Northwest heat wave in late June, one farm worker in St. Paul, Oregon, died while working on a crew moving irrigation lines. Adding insult to injury, Kalansky also warns that extreme heat, low humidity and the historic drought are a recipe for another destructive wildfire season. It primes the environment where if there is an ignition, its really dangerous in terms of fire because the fields are so dry, she said. And then if you add winds to it, thats when you really get these very dangerous conditions for wildfires. As temperatures continue to surge, Kalansky said that these extreme weather events are merely a preview of whats to come if the world continues to spew planet-heating emissions. I would be thoughtful of how to mitigate the impacts now, in an equitable way, especially for communities that are most impacted, she said. Its something very important to think about now and that will serve well, because this is likely to happen again in the not too distant future.",09/07/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/09/weather/heat-drought-climate-feedback-loop/index.html
Climate change is fueling mass-casualty heat waves. Here? why experts say we don? view them as crises,"The Pacific Northwest heat wave in late June was a mass casualty event, officials said. Hundreds of people likely died in the multi-day, record-breaking heat, and the death toll continues to rise. Officials are still investigating the cause of dozens of deaths that occurred during that time, but at least 83 people died from heat-related illness in Oregon, 54 of which were in Multnomah County, which includes Portland. Many of those people were older, living alone, and without functioning air conditioning, according to a a preliminary report on excessive heat deaths released by the county Tuesday. In Washington, at least 78 people died. Across the border in British Columbia, officials counted nearly 800 deaths from June 25 to July 1  500 more than normal for that time period and which they believe are tied to the heat, according to Lisa Lapointe, the chief coroner for the province. In reality, it could be months before we know the final toll. Despite the staggering statistics, there was no obvious sense of urgency around the tragedy as it played out  nothing similar to a hurricane making landfall, a gunman opening fire in a night club or a wildfire destroying a town. They were hundreds of quiet deaths from an invisible disaster: unprecedented heat, which dozens of scientists concluded was virtually impossible without climate change. Scientists and psychologists told CNN the response has to do with how humans view crises. When theres a wildfire or hurricane, its easy for people to see the devastation in front of their eyes, said Aaron Bernstein, the interim director for the Center for Climate, Health and the Global Environment at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Our brains are highly tuned to pictures of destruction, because we dont want that to happen to us. With heat waves, there usually isnt a visible swath of destruction. The heat wave also occurred against the backdrop of another deadly tragedy: a condo collapse in Surfside, Florida. As of Monday, 94 people have been declared dead, with 22 more unaccounted for. The heat wave began the day after the collapse, but only one of those events truly gripped the nations attention. Bernstein noted that the public response to a tragedy has to do partly with who is responsible. People want someone to blame, he said, and in tangible disasters its easy to point a finger  in the case of the Surfside collapse, a landlord or engineer. But its different with a global crisis like climate change, which doesnt kill people directly but instead makes it more likely that an event will be deadly. Theres no single person that you can point a finger to on climate change, Bernstein said. Our brains are much more likely to pay attention when theres a person to point a finger at. There are other reasons, but all of those reasons make very clear to me that we have to make climate change personal, actionable and urgent. Humans also tend to connect more with short-term tragedies than events that seem far-off, as climate change might feel, according to Astrid Caldas, a senior climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists. We cannot really compare the tragedies and the events, because they are separate and both were terrible events, Caldas told CNN. But there are all these complex constructs of peoples psyches and how media behavior contributes to that lack of same reaction. Such responses to climate change-fueled disasters and the harm its causing for people is not that dissimilar to peoples reactions toward the Covid-19 pandemic as the Delta variant spreads rapidly, according to Kristie Ebi, a climate and health researcher at the University of Washington. Over 600,000 Americans died (of Covid-19), and yet there was a limited response in many quarters, Ebi told CNN. When we look at heat waves, we often dont get the total number of deaths until months later, which are often much higher than initial estimates. Much like the pandemic, extreme heat also disproportionately kills low-income communities, people of color and the elderly populations. As of Monday, Oregon health authorities report about two-thirds of heat wave deaths were people of color. A 2020 analysis found that the number of heat-related deaths in the US each year has been underestimated since records typically only look at medical terms such as heat stroke, and neglects other potentially heat-related causes of death, like heart attacks and other underlying conditions. Ebi said most people, particularly in a typically mild region like the Pacific Northwest, dont perceive heat as a health risk. People are generally unaware and dont think about the risks associated with these high temperatures, she said. Theres been a number of efforts to try and increase that awareness, and yet, theres almost no research to back up whats an effective approach. Researchers say its important to understand that climate change is already affecting our lives today  that unless climate resiliency or heat action plans are put in place, particularly in historically marginalized communities, multiple people will suffer and die from extreme heat as climate change accelerates. If nothing is done, and people continue to be vulnerable, I would say, by logic, the number of people affected would go up, Caldas said. We need to have an idea of what could happen if we dont act. Its about trying to prevent what can happen, if we dont take any action.",13/07/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/12/weather/climate-change-mass-casualty-psychology/index.html
EU unveils ambitious climate package as it cools on fossil fuels,"The European Union has unveiled some of the worlds most ambitious proposals to reduce carbon emissions and wean its 27 members off fossil fuels, including taxes on emissions-heavy imports into the union and non-renewable energy, such as oil, gas and coal. The package of measures looks to fundamentally transform the worlds single largest trading bloc. It touches on almost every area of economic activity  from how citizens heat their homes and commute, to a total upheaval of manufacturing practices. The EU last month enshrined in law its target to reduce emissions by 55% by 2030, compared with 1990 levels, but on Wednesday unveiled the aggressive 10-step program, titled Fit for 55, which is a roadmap for how it will achieve its reduction. At a press conference in Brussels on Wednesday, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that Europe had become the first continent with a comprehensive architecture to meet its climate ambitions. We have the goal, but now we present the roadmap to how we are going to get there, she said. We know, for example, our current fossil fuel economy has reached its limits. And we know we have to move on to new model one that is powered by innovation, that has clean energy that is moving toward a circular economy. While the package is bold, climate activists have criticized the 55% target for not being strong enough to prevent global temperatures from rising to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, which scientists say is necessary to stave off more severe impacts of climate change. The European Union accounts for around 8% of the worlds carbon emissions from fossil fuels. Containing rising temperatures will need firm action from bigger economies, including the US and China, the worlds two biggest carbon emitters. The plan is also unlikely to be implemented in the way that von der Leyen and her fellow commissioners have envisioned. First, it must go through the EUs exhaustive legislative process, which could take many months, even years. It will need to be read, amended and approved by both lawmakers in the EU Parliament and the EU Council, the forum in which the elected leaders of each member state debate such matters. The plans  which form part of von der Leyens broader Green Deal, a key plank of her Commissions 2019-2024 agenda  takes particular aim at transport, both personal and commercial, across the block. Von der Leyen announced cars with combustion engines, for example, would not be produced within the bloc from 2035. Financial incentives would be offered to countries that replace traditional fuel with a sustainable alternative in aviation and maritime transportation. The proposed carbon border would place tariffs on certain goods produced outside the bloc, depending on their carbon footprint, subjecting them to the same standards that already exist for goods produced within the EU. The plans is to discourage EU companies from importing cheaper materials from places where environmental standards are lower. In the initial implementation, the sectors affected would include cement, iron and steel, aluminum, fertilizer and, crucially, electricity. Minimum tax rate for petrol and gasoline fuels would be increased by significant margins, as would tax on kerosene. Another key pillar of Wednesdays package is a lowering of the cap in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), the worlds first and largest carbon market. Created in 2005, the ETS works by placing a cap on the carbon emissions companies within the EU are allowed to produce each year. If a company goes over, they are fined. They can also buy allowances from others in the ETS, roll over unused allowances. Over time, the cap set by the ETS goes down across the entire carbon market. Presenting the package, von der Leyen said that these measures, which would cost 500bn at the Europe level alone would also create financial incentives for the private sector, so that they complement the EUs overall ambition. There is likely to be pushback against many of the proposals within the EU. EU officials admitted to CNN that even getting the college of commissioners to agree on what von der Leyen put forward on Wednesday was a struggle. Some member states are poorer than others, meaning the transition to Brussels goals are harder, while other member states have economies built on industries that by their nature produce more emissions. It will also be politically difficult, as member states are currently divided on many other pan-European issues  from rule of law to human rights  and will likely use this debate on climate change as a proxy for other ongoing rows. EU diplomats told CNN that they expected opposition from countries like Poland and Hungary, who are currently embroiled with the European Commission, but also potentially wealthy and powerful nations like Germany, which has a mixed history on climate change due to its large manufacturing base. But there are also many Members of European Parliament who think the proposals dont go far enough. If the Council waters down von der Leyens initial text to appease opposing member states, there is also the possibility that parliamentary objection could grow. The proposals presented by the Commission, postpones the most stringent climate measures until the past 2030, said Michael Bloss, a German MEP sitting in the parliaments Green group. In their proposal, free allowances for industry will only end in 2036, the kerosene tax only applies fully as of 2030 and the internal combustion engine will only be phased out in 2035. Although it is technologically and economically possible to implement these policies earlier, in this form, the Green Deal will not be enough to limit global warming to 1.5C, he said. On the other side of the debate, MEPs like Gunar Beck  who represents the right-wing nationalist Alternative fur Deutschland (AfD), Germanys largest opposition party  say that while they dont dispute a need to tackle climate change globally, the EUs position could have negative effects. Even if the EU becomes carbon neutral, other developing countries will rapidly increase their emissions. What it will do is worsen the competitive position of EU companies and further impair the EUs economic recovery, he said. If negotiations drag for years, von der Leyen and her allies may not even be around to see them through, as their mandate ends in November 2024. While climate change is not going to be dropped from the EU agenda any time soon, the political makeup of the bloc could change radically in that time. There are elections in Germany and France that could shake up both countries within the next year and, post-pandemic, the political direction for the future of the EU is uncertain.",14/07/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/14/europe/eu-climate-change-policies-fit-for-55-intl/index.html
"Joe Manchin says he? ?ery, very?disturbed about reconciliation proposals on climate change","Sen. Joe Manchin, the Democrats most pivotal swing vote, expressed his most serious concerns yet about a key element in their partys $3.5 trillion sweeping economic plan: Provisions dealing with climate change that have been sought by progressives. Manchin, who hails from coal-producing West Virginia, told CNN that hes very, very disturbed by provisions he believes would eliminate fossil fuels  a warning sign for Democrats who need all 50 members of their caucus to sign off on the plan in order to get it through the Senate. But the climate provisions are key to getting support from liberals, particularly in the House. And how Democratic leaders keep both factions of their caucus will be key to determining if they can approve much of President Joe Bidens domestic agenda by the fall. I know they have the climate portion in here, and Im concerned about that, Manchin said moments after Biden met with Senate Democrats in the Capitol on Wednesday. Because if theyre eliminating fossils, and Im finding out theres a lot of language in places theyre eliminating fossils, which is very, very disturbing, because if youre sticking your head in the sand, and saying that fossil (fuel) has to be eliminated in America, and they want to get rid of it, and thinking thats going to clean up the global climate, it wont clean it up all. If anything, it would be worse. Democrats still need to draft their bill to expand the social safety net, which would go through the budget reconciliation process by September and cannot be filibustered, meaning it can advance with just 51 votes rather than 60. Separately, Manchin is central to an effort to approve nearly $600 billion in new spending on a narrower bill on infrastructure. But that infrastructure plan is going through the typical legislative process, which would need the support of at least 10 Republicans to overcome any filibuster attempt. The dual-track approach will only succeed if Senate Democrats unify behind it. But its clear that party leaders have their work cut out for them to keep their caucus in line. Thats a big amount, said Sen. Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, when asked about the $3.5 trillion price tag. Yeah, I think we just got to figure out how its being spent, and how its being applied, figure out how its going to be paid for, and then make the assessment. In the proposal, Democrats propose a wide-range of measures dealing with child care, immigration, Medicare expansion and corporate tax hikes. But Manchin seemed generally open to most of the ideas, including the price tag, though the climate provisions sparked his ire. In the plan, Democrats want to meet Bidens climate change goals of 80% clean electricity and 50% economy-wide carbon emissions by 2030, according to a senior Democratic aide. The measure would fund a clean energy standard, vehicle tax incentives and electrification of buildings  among other matters. The measure also would propose methane reduction and polluter import fees to reduce emissions, the aide said. Manchin wouldnt say if the climate provisions would be a dealbreaker for him, but said: I think reasonable people, if you show them the facts, and you agree that these are the facts, youll make the adjustments accordingly. And thats what Im hopeful for. ... Im going to do everything I can to make sure the United States of America remains energy independent. Manchin said he did not speak up when Biden was in attendance at Wednesdays lunch. But after Biden left, Manchin relayed his concerns to his colleagues. Asked if Biden singled him out, Manchin said, He talked a little bit. Said Joe this, and Joe that. ... A lot of Joes back and forth. No, no, no, we have a great relationship and well talk in detail. Manchin said Biden spoke about a priority in his state: making sure the abandoned mine lands are going to get cleaned up. People are going to get good jobs. Were going to be plugging a lot of orphan wells. Which are good jobs. Yet there are other potential landmines ahead, as well. Manchin also said that hes concerned about more spending driving up inflation. Im concerned, Manchin said. Im going to talk to some economists. Im going to dig deep into that. People in West Virginia, I spoke about this right now, are paying much higher gas prices; theyre paying food prices. ... Its not just a threat; its happening.",14/07/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/14/politics/joe-manchin-reconciliation-climate-change/index.html
European officials say ?limate change has arrived?as deadly floods engulf entire towns,"European officials have said climate change contributed to this weeks extreme flooding, which has left entire towns submerged and more than 120 people dead. Scientists have for decades warned that climate change will make extreme weather events, including heavy rain and deadly flooding, more likely. Around 100 of those killed after torrential rainfall since Wednesday were in Germanys western states of Rhineland-Palatinate and North Rhine-Westphalia, where local leaders are urging the world for swifter action on climate change as villages under their watch become a new and unexpected epicenter of global warming. Neighboring Belgium has also been hit hard by the floods, which have killed 20 people in the country and could rise further, Interior Minister Annelies Verlinden said Friday at a press conference. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Friday that flooding in northwestern Europe was evidence of the need for urgency in acting on climate change. Science tells us that with climate change, we see more and more extreme weather phenomenons that last longer, said von der Leyen, two days after unveiling an ambitious package of climate change proposals for the EU. It is the intensity and the length of these events when science tells us this is a clear indication of climate change and that this is something that really, really shows the urgency to act. German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday met with US President Joe Biden in Washington, DC, where she welcomed Americas return to the Paris agreement on climate change, saying it would strengthen this years annual climate talks  known as the Conference of the Parties  in Glasgow, Scotland, later this year. We talked about the challenges of climate change, and Im very, very glad that the United States have returned to the Paris Accord, and that this gives us a very different basis in Glasgow to fight for more climate protection at the Conference of the Parties, she said. I think the meteorological events  whether its fires hitting the United States, dramatically high temperatures, or just sudden irregular rainfalls  indicate that the number of extraordinarily weather events has increased dramatically in recent years. We need to respond to that. Her comments echoed those of her environment minister, Svenja Schulze, who tweeted Thursday: Climate change has arrived in Germany. The events show with what force the consequences of climate change can affect us all, and how important it is for us to adjust to extreme weather events in the future. There is growing acknowledgement and acceptance now from many politicians that anthropogenic  or human-induced  climate change plays a role in extreme weather events. Biden, for example, recently linked the extreme heat and prolonged drought in the US to climate change. Scientists are now able to estimate just how big a role climate change has played in a particular event. Its too soon to make conclusions about current flooding in Europe, but estimates are likely to be made in coming days. A similar, though less extreme, flooding event in Western Europe in 2016 that killed 18 people in Germany, France, Romania and Belgium, for example, was found to be 80-90% more likely to occur than it was in the past before anthropogenic climate change. While officials at the national and EU level are sounding the horn on climate, so too are local leaders on the disasters front lines. The premier of North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany  Armin Laschet, who is also the Conservatives candidate to succeed Merkel  said the floods in his state were a catastrophe of historic proportion, calling on the world to speed up its efforts to both mitigate and adapt to climate change. The floods have literally pulled the rug from under peoples feet, Laschet said. We will be faced with such events over and over, and that means we need to speed up climate protection measures, on European, federal and global levels, because climate change isnt confined to one state, he said. As the Earths atmosphere warms, it can hold more moisture, which in some cases leads to unprecedented rainfall. It may be that the total average rainfall in an area doesnt change, but extremes are amplified, which can mean longer dry periods or more intense storms. Flash flooding occurs when rain falls faster than the ground can absorb it. It is flash because its onset is rapid  water levels can rise meters in minutes. When there is more water vapor in a warmer atmosphere, rainfall rates can increase and flash flooding is more likely to occur. And drought can actually compound this effect. Very dry soil cant absorb water efficiently  think of trying to wet a very dry sponge. While the rain is ultimately beneficial, if a region that has been experiencing intense drought gets hit with heavy rain, flash flooding is more likely to occur. Thats the dynamic in Germany and Belgium at the moment. Just a few months ago, there were historically low water levels on the Rhine in Cologne, which were disrupting shipping along the river, but now the river has swelled from two months of rain falling in just one day. The projections for how much the Earth would warm have largely been correct, said Myles Allen, a climate scientist at the University of Oxford. But there have been outliers  namely, the warming in Europe has been faster than predicted. Allen said scientists expected more extreme weather events, but records are being blown away at a concerning clip  the unprecedented heat wave in the Northwest US in late June is another recent example. Extreme events happen and records get broken all the time, Allen said, but it is worrying that were seeing such rapid intensification. With more action, he said, climate change could be addressed in a generation. Deadly flooding and heatwaves serve as a reminder of the climate crisis reach. A problem is that every climate documentary starts with an image of a polar bear, which send the message that climate change happens in the Arctic, on the other side of the world, Allen said. But these events show thats not true.",16/07/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/16/europe/germany-floods-belgium-climate-change-grm-intl/index.html
Scientists are worried by how fast the climate crisis has amplified extreme weather,"Until recently, climate change had been talked about as a future threat. Its frontlines were portrayed as remote places like the Arctic, where polar bears are running out of sea ice to hunt from. Sea level rise and extreme drought was a problem for the developing world. But in the past month, its been the developed world on the frontline. In the past four weeks, floods in Germany engulfed streets and swallowed homes that had stood for more than a century in the quiet village of Schuld. A Canadian town of just 250  known more for its cool, mountain air  burned to the ground in a wildfire that followed unprecedented heat. And in the western United States, just weeks after a historic heatwave, some 20,000 firefighters and personnel have been deployed to extinguish 80 large fires that have consumed more than 1 million acres (4,047 square kilometers). Climate scientists have for decades warned that the climate crisis would lead to more extreme weather. They said it would be deadly and it would be more frequent. But many are expressing surprise that heat and rain records are being broken by such large margins. Since the 1970s, scientists have predicted the extent to which the world would warm fairly accurately. Whats harder for their models to predict  even as computers get more and more powerful  is how intense the impact will be. Michael E. Mann, the director of the Earth System Science Center at Penn State University, told CNN the past few weeks have showed the limitation of climate change models. There is an important factor with many of these events, including the recent heat dome event out west, that the climate models dont capture, Mann said. The models are underestimating the magnitude of the impact of climate change on extreme weather events. In climate models, Mann explained, day-to-day weather is just noise. It looks a lot like chaos. Its only the most extreme events that stand out as a clear signal. The signal is emerging from the noise more quickly than models predicted, Mann said. The [real world] signal is now large enough that we can see it in the daily weather, even though the models didnt see it coming. That means historic events like the flooding in Germany or the wildfire in Canada didnt register in the predictions. To make that happen, scientists say, we need even more powerful climate models. Tim Palmer, a research Professor in Climate Physics at the University of Oxford, is one of several scientists who have been calling for a global center for modeling that would house an exascale supercomputer  a machine that can process a mind-boggling amount of data. Scientists and governments in the 1950s established the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), when it became clear that to advance the field of particle physics would require a machine so expensive it was unlikely any single country would develop it. As an international organization, CERN has been hugely successful, Palmer told CNN. Thats what we need for climate change. Scientists use computer simulations of weather events to make projections of how they may change decades into the future. But they cant zoom in enough  even to a city level  to predict the most extreme events. Despite technologys progress, computers are still not typically sophisticated enough to operate at such a high resolution. Palmer said climate models must get there. If worldwide were spending trillions of dollars adapting to climate change, weve got to know exactly what were adapting to, Palmer said, whether its floods, droughts, storms or sea level rise. While the recent extreme weather events in the Northern Hemisphere took many by surprise, they were not completely unexpected, said Richard Allan, a professor of climate science at the University of Reading. This is what the science has always been pointing towards, he said. But he agrees that better computers would be useful in making more detailed and refined projections. Its also difficult to assess how weather patterns will shift and alter in the future, including whether westerly flow over Europe will be more commonly blocked, causing thunderstorms to stall over one place, such has been the case over Europe in July 2021, or more lengthy and sustained heatwaves such as over western North America, said Allan. Even without this granular modeling, climate activists  and, increasingly, communities affected by extreme weather events  are calling for more action on climate change. German Chancelor Angela Merkel said over the weekend that, We have to hurry, we have to get faster in the fight against climate change. Several developed countries, including the US, have this year significantly increased their commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The European Union last week unveiled an ambitious plan to put climate at the center of just about every development and economic initiative it has. Yet many activists say that their pledges still fall short of the action needed to contain average global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius, which the International Panel for Climate Change says is necessary to avoid even more catastrophic impacts of climate change. They also criticize governments that make ambitious pledges while continuing to approve new fossil fuel projects, including coal mines, and oil and gas facilities. Merritt Turetsky, director at the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research, is hoping that these weather events in the developed world will galvanize that kind of action. She is herself challenging her own perceptions of where climate change frontlines are and who is vulnerable. Maybe this is a necessary evil, Turetsky said. We used to think of frontlines as island nations because of sea level rises, or the Arctic. We know there is a cognitive dissonance when climate change is impacting people so far away from you and everything you know. We tend to put it on a shelf, because its one thing to see this is what they say, but its another thing to feel it. Were at a point where everyone on the planet now has felt the impacts of climate change itself, or at least someone they love or know has. Its circling in closer and closer. Thats certainly the feeling among residents in Germanys Schuld. When you look at whats happening in Canada, where they had temperatures of 50 degrees, and whats going on all over the world, it is clear this is the result of climate change, Niklas Pieters told CNN, as he helped his parents clear the debris from their ravaged home in Schuld on Monday. I dont want to have to get used to this.",20/07/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/20/world/climate-change-extreme-weather-speed-cmd-intl/index.html
Seeking your climate refuge? Consider this,"It was the trees that my family loved most about California: the coast redwoods, Monterey cypress and giant sequoias that have stood watch and borne witness to the passage of time for a million years. And it was the trees, now parched and burning in a world radically altered by the accelerating buildup of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere, that drove us away. Californias forests are some of the most awe-inspiring places on earth  as much for their grandeur as for the carbon dioxide that they absorb from the atmosphere and store away in their trunks and roots. But the past few years have seen the most horrific wildfire seasons on record in California. 2018s Camp Fire killed 86 people and burned so many buildings that the metal particles released into the air caused lead levels to spike to 15 times higher than normal in the Bay Area, according to a report from California Air Resources Board. Last year broke records when more than 4 million acres burned, and this year, according to data from Cal Fire, is so far on track to be even worse. This is all fueled by an ongoing drought emergency in 41 of the states 58 counties, worse than any experienced in recorded history. Water has run out in rural towns in the Central Valley. In California, many are now considering what only a few years ago was unthinkable: In a time of accelerating fossil-fueled climate impacts, how much longer will we stay? And as ever more human beings are forced to navigate the dual emotions of grief about all were losing and anxiety about how we keep ourselves and our communities safe, how do we also maintain a focus on stopping the planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions that are causing this catastrophe in the first place, and keep it from getting worse? First, if you are considering uprooting your life because of climate change, let that sink in. Let that reality, a scenario that was likely inconceivable to you just a few years ago, radicalize you to the all-encompassing scope, scale and urgency of this existential, all-encompassing crisis. Take this moment to align your life with this new reality. Become an activist. Get political. Educate yourself and others on the solutions that already exist to address this crisis. If you buy a house, electrify it  meaning replacing technologies that depend on fossil fuels with ones that use renewable energy. Identify the leverage points you can tap in your life in every sphere of influence  as an individual, an employee, a community member, a citizen  to make an outsized impact wherever you can. Process the emotion of it all: that in the year 2021, the climate crisis changed your life personally, fundamentally and permanently. Let the emotion fuel the ferocity of your action. For my family, San Francisco, the place that we loved and built community  the place where my daughter was born and my son learned to ride a bike  brought health impacts from smoke that in the end were too much for our set of circumstances. The only useful way that I have managed to deal with that grief is to use it to remind myself and others of the reality of this crisis and all thats at stake. Second, like it or not, youll represent what the future may hold for whatever town you may choose to move to  an early warning for communities that have yet to experience the direct and devastating effects of the climate crisis. Use your climate story to sound the alarm to others about the urgency of our unfolding planetary emergency. Dont make this move in silence. Broadcast the reality of it to mobilize everyone you can. Do it loudly. Do it everywhere. Signal the urgency and gravity of the issue through your behavior. Show up at city council meetings. Encourage your city or county to declare a climate emergency. Get involved in local issues  for me, that means joining the growing community of Water Protectors and allies to oppose the Line 3 pipeline. Focus on deepening community ties and building resilience, because both will be essential elements in an era of chaos and change. Third, ensure that your climate-related move doesnt exacerbate existing inequity. Climate migration risks deepening class divides, disrupting local culture and furthering a history of colonialism. When my family relocated to Duluth, Minnesota, the most valuable advice we received came from Karen Diver, the former tribal leader of the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa  the original caretakers of the place we now call home. Dont let your climate solution result in our spiritual and cultural genocide. Learn about the history of the land youll call home. Stand for the rights of indigenous people. Support public programs and community groups. Tread lightly. And remember that climate change is first and foremost a crisis faced by people far less privileged than us. Global warming has been an existential crisis for communities around the world for decades, from Bangladesh to Madagascar, from Syria to the Central Valley; often those who have done the least to contribute to global greenhouse gas emissions but for whom the impacts and implications are far more dire. The ability to worry about or work on climate change is a luxury that many cant afford. Ultimately, well all realize that there is no such thing as a climate-safe place, only places with different climate-related impacts, unfolding on different timescales, to differently-equipped people, interconnected in ways we cant begin to fathom. I write this from the city that welcomed my family when we left California, (a city that has been called a climate safe haven), under a red sun setting in an orange sky, as smoke from forest fires in Canada cause unhealthy air quality even here. There is no away from climate change. Wherever the forest fires are raging, the heat domes are suffocating, the levees are breaking, the famines are starving, the infrastructure is melting, the living things are dying  its happening to us all. At this pivotal moment in human and planetary history, the question for us cannot only be, Where might I be safe? but also, Where might I be of most use? This is no time for the most privileged among us to insulate ourselves inside our climate havens. This is a time to open our arms wide, contributing and engaging in every way we can to the global effort to reimagine everything about the way we inhabit this planet. A time to find a way, despite the odds, to come back into balance with the earths exquisitely interconnected  and still living  natural systems.",20/07/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/20/opinions/climate-change-migration-alexander/index.html
Extreme weather events put spotlight on climate change? toll on US infrastructure,"Americas infrastructure has taken a beating from extreme weather events in recent weeks spurred by climate change, raising concerns among officials that the nations roads, bridges and even commercial flights cant stand the severe conditions. With roads buckling in the Pacific Northwest, a deluge drenching a New York City subway station and fatal flooding across Europe, scientists say climate change is here and immediate action is needed. The countrys crumbling infrastructure has commanded attention as the US has faced the unprecedented heat, drought and wildfires and the Biden administration has pushed costly proposals to address it. I think people see it, but Im not sure they realize how much worse its going to get and how quickly, Josh DeFlorio, head of climate resilience for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, told CNN. On the West Coast, there is concern over the extreme heat that melted some of I-5 in Seattle last month and claimed the lives of hundreds in the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia. Western states have also faced an unprecedented, multi-year drought and as of Sunday, the US was grappling with 80 fires and complexes that had burned 1,157,976 acres so far, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has called for improving infrastructure that can endure the effects of climate change. The simple reality that we need to have more climate resilient infrastructure and we need to stop climate change from getting any worse, he said last week while in Oregon to promote President Joe Bidens infrastructure framework. Shane Underwood, who researches asphalt at North Carolina State University, told CNN that with the world getting hotter, road crews should start laying down asphalt that is more heat resistant. If temperatures are greater than we presumed they would exist when the pavement was designed, this can happen more frequently, Underwood said. But while officials and scientists are calling for an infrastructure overhaul and swift action on climate change, the overlying issue is how to pay for it. Negotiations on Capitol Hill over how to fund a massive bipartisan infrastructure bill, which includes $47 billion for climate change resilience, are intensifying. On Sunday, a Democratic aide confirmed to CNN that Republicans and Democrats in the bipartisan group have agreed to scrap an enhanced IRS enforcement provision after conservatives pushed back, endangering the groups ability to get a deal ahead of a procedural vote scheduled for Wednesday to advance the legislation. Ohio Sen. Sen. Rob Portman, a Republican whos helping to negotiate the bipartisan proposal, told CNNs Dana Bash that the group of senators from each party working on the package was meeting again on Sunday to work through its details. And provisions to address climate change are complicating Democrats $3.5 trillion sweeping economic plan. The key element in the legislation, which is part of the partys two-track approach to accomplish Bidens sweeping social agenda, has drawn concern from Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat representing coal-producing West Virginia and Democrats most pivotal swing vote in the Senate. The climate provisions, though, are key to getting support from liberals, particularly in the House.",23/07/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/23/politics/infrastructure-extreme-weather-climate-change/index.html
"?nce in a thousand years?rains devastated central China, but there is little talk of climate change","As record heat waves hit western North America and deadly floods swept Germany, the growing risks associated with climate change have grabbed headlines, and prompted widespread discussions in the West. Scientists have been warning for years that the climate crisis would amplify extreme weather, making it deadlier and more frequent  and the latest catastrophes are seen as a timely reminder the threat could hit much closer to home than some might think. But this week, with much of Chinas central Henan province devastated by record rains, there was little reference to the broader climate crisis among Chinese officials, scientists or state media. The silence is all the more conspicuous given how much Chinese authorities have emphasized the extremeness and rarity of the weather. At one point, the provincial capital of Zhengzhou was pelted by nearly 8 inches (20 centimeters) of rain in an hour. In just three days, it had 24 inches (61 centimeters)  or nearly a years worth  of rainfall, according to the Zhengzhou meteorological station. Zhengzhous weather station called it a once in a thousand years downpour. Henans water resources department went a step further, claiming rain levels recorded at some stations could only be seen once every 5,000 years. But on Thursday, state-run newspaper the Global Times said Ren Guoyu, a chief expert at Chinas National Climate Center, dismissed the connection between heavy rain in Zhengzhou and global climate change. Instead, he attributed the flooding to abnormal planetary scale atmospheric circulation, the report said. Liu Junyan, climate and energy project leader for Greenpeace East Asia, said without the impact of climate change, it is very difficult to imagine such extreme rainfall would occur in an inland city like Zhengzhou. But she said it is rare for Chinese weather and climate authorities to acknowledge a potential climate change connection in the aftermath of extreme occurrences, because such analysis requires more research and data. Out of caution, they basically avoid talking about it, she said. Such associations are also seldom reported by state media, she added. That stands in stark contrast to how climate scientists and the media have responded in the West. While full analysis is needed to confirm to what degree changes to the earths climate have affected specific extreme weather events, many experts agree the trend is clear. Scientists at the United Nations World Meteorological Organization (WMO), for example, conducted a rapid attribution analysis, which found the western North America heat waves would have been virtually impossible without climate change. WMO Secretary General Petteri Taalas later said they were clearly linked to global warming. It is not that Chinese leaders do not admit climate change is real. On the contrary, President Xi Jinping wants China, the worlds largest emitter of greenhouse gases, to become a global leader on the climate crisis. Last year, he pledged to hit domestic peak emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, earning international praise. In the official narrative, climate change is often presented as a global crisis that China, a responsible major power, has stepped up to solve, especially as the former Trump administration rolled back US involvement. Less mentioned, however, are the direct threats it poses to China, and its effect on the daily lives of its 1.4 billion people. Chinese authorities are also wary that climate activism popular among young people in the West could spread to China. Last September, 17-year-old Ou Hongyi, known as the Greta Thunberg of China, was detained and questioned for hours by police when she joined the Global Climate Strike in Shanghai, an international event that attracted thousands of protesters at more than 3,500 locations worldwide. That has made it difficult for the Chinese public to realize how they are personally related to the climate crisis, Liu said. Like some in the West, Chinese people tend to perceive the dangers of climate change as something remote  threatening only the melting ice caps in the Arctic or low-lying islands in the tropics. And although emission cuts and green reforms are often mentioned in state media and classrooms, many treat them as just another state policy for local governments to follow. For many, climate change is more of an issue about politics, about economic gains and costs, and international collaboration, Liu said. But as the devastation in Henan shows, many Chinese cities are not prepared to deal with the climate risks from increasingly frequent and intense extreme weather. In the 18 hours before the evening rush on Tuesday, Zhengzhous weather station issued five consecutive red alerts for torrential rain. According to guidance from the China Meteorological Administration, the alert should have prompted authorities to halt gatherings, suspend classes and businesses  advice Zhengzhou authorities apparently failed to heed. As the deaths of 12 passengers trapped on a flooded subway gripped the nation, some have questioned why authorities didnt shut down it down earlier to avoid casualties. The situation could be worse in smaller towns and villages around Zhengzhou with far less contingency planning, rescue resources and media exposure, Liu said. The last time Henan saw similarly intense downpours was nearly half a century ago. In 1975, a super typhoon dumped huge amounts of rain onto the province  one village at the center of the storm saw 63 inches (160 centimeters) of rain in three days. Overflowing rivers burst 62 dams, killing more than 26,000 people by the official count, though other estimates were several times higher. While the connection between climate change and extreme weather in China might not have received much official mention, it doesnt mean Chinese scientists havent been studying the issue. A senior meteorologist with the Chinese Academy of Engineering, for example, has published a paper on the impact of climate change on extreme torrential rains in Chinese mega cities. On Chinese social media, too, some have started to reflect on the lack of discussions on the issue. On Weibo, Chinas heavily censored version of Twitter, one user said she was disappointed to find very, very few discussions about climate change on major social media platforms. In Henan, the (disaster) unfolded too quickly in such a short time, she wrote. But in other places, its like boiling a frog in warm water  it might not cause any immediate life threatening danger, but in the long run, I reckon itll also affect how we live and work. Diving in headfirst: Chinese athletes practice for the diving event in Tokyo, Japan, on Thursday ahead of the Olympic Games, which begin on Friday. The Chinese delegation includes more than 770 people, including athletes, coaches and support staff, according to state-run news outlet CCTV  and more than 99% of the delegation is fully vaccinated against Covid-19. A childrens book about sheep led to the arrest of five people in Hong Kong on Thursday, under the citys sweeping national security law. The book series depicts a sheep village  but police say the books referenced parts of the 2019 pro-democracy anti-government protests, including the 12 Hong Kongers who were caught and detained by Chinese authorities after trying to flee by boat. The protests, which often turned violent and threw the semi-autonomous Chinese city into political turmoil, prompted the Chinese government to promulgate the security law last summer. It granted far reaching new powers to authorities, who wasted little time in detaining activists, raiding newspapers, and banning public protest. Police said in a statement that the five people  all core members of the General Union of Hong Kong Speech Therapists  were arrested on suspicion of conspiring to publish seditious material that incited hate toward the Hong Kong government, one of the crimes laid out in the security law. In a separate news conference, however, police said they had been arrested under articles 9 and 10 of the law  which allow the government to regulate the internet, the media, and other communications to prevent terrorist activities and to promote national security education in schools. CNN has reached out to police, but was not offered an explanation as to the discrepancies in the statements. In the news conference, police said the storylines depicted in the childrens books beautify illegal acts of political violence, and urged parents to get rid of books that would harm the mind of the next generation. Police denied accusations the law was being used as a legal trap for publishers or media outlets  but the arrests are deepening fears of censorship nevertheless. In the past year, authorities have ordered schools to ban certain textbooks that may violate the law, blocked websites on national security grounds, and revised film censorship guidelines to abide by the law. A wave of Chinese firms have reportedly backed off of plans to go public in the United States. Tough US laws requiring audits for foreign companies and a growing crackdown by Beijing has made it increasingly tough for Chinese tech companies to approach Wall Street. Since February, shares of overseas-listed Chinese tech firms have lost a staggering $1 trillion in value, marking one of the biggest sell-offs of all time, according to Goldman Sachs analysts. And, after a disastrous IPO by ride-hailing giant Didi, TikTok owner Bytedance, social e-commerce platform Xiaohongshu, fitness app Keep and medical data company LinkDoc Technology have all either shelved or scrapped plans to list in New York, according to media reports. It may very well be the end  at least temporarily  to US listings for Chinese companies, according to Doug Guthrie, a professor and director of China Initiatives at Arizona State Universitys Thunderbird School of Global Management. He added that a serious pause on such listings could be in effect until US-China relations improve. There are still ways for Chinese companies to tap overseas investment even if the US is no longer an option. They can go to Hong Kong, for example, which also has a diverse pool of international investors and a regulatory regime that meets international standards. But the US market still has an irreplaceable role, as its bigger than any other financial market in the world, has a greater turnover in stocks and places a higher value on company earnings. That means a company listing in America may find it easier to achieve a higher valuation and sell more shares.

Chef says climate change can be tackled if you cook the way your momma (really) did,"There is nothing more dear to us than our food culture  what our momma cooks, what our grandma fed us. Being told that what is on our plate is hurting the planet can feel like a threat to our souls. Science and innovation are bringing a dizzying number of new meat alternatives, from the booming rise of Beyond and Impossible to dozens of global startups hoping to replace land-hungry, pollution-belching animal agriculture with protein fermented in labs. But chef Camilla Marcus prefers to look back to find food solutions. Modern diets are formed by an overhang from the industrial revolution, she says. Which is not how your mom cooked. That isnt how historical cultures cooked. It was much more about zero waste and being sustainable. Nothing was left on a plate, nothing wasnt repurposed. Depending on her age and locale, maybe your mom depended on frozen TV dinners, but that way of cooking  along with supermarkets stocked with only the best cuts of factory-farmed meat and visually perfect produce  is the real insult to food tradition, Marcus argues. No one could afford it or could conceive of a packaged, perfect piece of steak. That isnt how people bought things. They bought things from their neighbors. They bought things from local shop, she says. After being trained at the International Culinary Center and working her way up through some of the best reviewed restaurants in the world, Marcus opened west-bourne in the Soho neighborhood in New York with the hopes of being a model for sustainable, earth-conscious, zero-waste dining. Our whole goal was sort of accidentally vegetarian, but decidedly wholesome, she says. I genuinely believe that were not going to convince the public to be vegetarian or vegan. Id rather try and get someone to eat plant-based a couple of meals a week or a couple of days a week. Growing up in Los Angeles, Marcus mother shopped locally, buying all-natural kids snacks from Mrs. Goochs (a market later acquired by Whole Foods), using washable napkins and rinsing out bottles to return to the milkman. It wasnt until she arrived on the East Coast for college and culinary school that she realized her family was old-fashioned in the best possible way. Thats when the light bulb went off  oh, I had this really unusual childhood and I didnt realize that people didnt think like that and didnt think about how theyre storing things, where theyre shopping, how theyre cooking, what theyre using, what theyre throwing away, she said. A new report by the European grocery giant, Tesco, and the WWF conservation organization finds that humanity wastes a staggering 2.5 billion metric tons of food each year. So instead of evangelizing a mass migration to veganism, Marcus hopes people will start taking small steps to make their diets more sustainable. Carnivores can search out organic, grass-fed-and-finished meat from a so-called whole butcher committed to minimal waste. And if youre throwing out a lot of broccoli stems because your children only eat the tops, look up something to do with them, like add them to a smoothie. I dont think its that our eyes are bigger than our stomachs, she said of the challenges facing the country. I think we throw out a lot. We dont know what to do with it ... and I think on the supply side, we throw a lot out because we think that the public doesnt want it and that may or may not be true. If shoppers and diners were happier to buy bruised kale or did not demand it out of season, the industry and even policy makers would follow suit, she said. First, though, there has to be more understanding and options. Marcus has done plenty of learning of her own. After demanding that her west-bourne staff source only compostable or reusable items and eliminating virtually all food waste, hers was the first eatery certified under the TRUE program. But just as she learned her restaurant had achieved an even higher sustainability certification, the Covid-19 lockdown put her out of business and pandemic priorities took the focus off sustainability. As someone who cares about climate change and our environment, it was really hard to see single-use plastics come back with a vengeance sort of overnight, she said. She gave birth during lockdown and, cut-off from her beloved staff, began connecting with other chefs to create the Independent Restaurant Coalition. With so many eateries in deep financial shock and PPP loans poorly designed for that industry, they are lobbying for a Restaurants Revitalization Act to help others avoid the same door-closing fate. Shes confident that as the world reopens, her west-bourne model could still become the norm as more people dine out with the knowledge that every bite consumed has a cost to land, air, water and the climate not often reflected on the check. I do think Millennials and Gen-Z are actually thinking about that and going, you know what, I dont know that I need steak on the plate tonight. You know, its OK, Marcus says. Its really been obviously a brutally painful period, but I think one that hopefully has catalyzed real systemic change. I think that it really has been a long time coming. That change could be a realization that eating well is more than just about food. You choose your favorite places to eat because they make you feel good and you like the vibe, she said, not simply because its the right price and they always deliver on time. The same could also be true of ingredients, she says. Not necessarily the prettiest or the cheapest  though she argues that policies like subsidies must change to make good food affordable to all  but the ones that make us, and the bigger community feel good. Chefs and restaurants have their part to play, as does the food industry and government she says. But as the pandemic shone new light on food producers and grocery store clerks along with first responders, maybe there will be new views of food and eating that persist. We should be asking ourselves, why is a plastic knife 10 cents on the dollar to a fully compostable, biodegradable one? Marcus said. Thats where the rubber will hit the road. With the massive impact of Americas food industry on its greenhouse emissions, big changes are needed. But small ones can have an impact too.

Floods in London are the latest sign big cities aren? ready for climate change,"Cars stranded in streets turned to rivers. Bus passengers rescued by raft. Train stations submerged, sparking travel chaos. The now-familiar scenes of a city inundated by floods played out in London over the weekend, when heavy rainfall put parts of the UK capital underwater. When two London hospitals turned non-emergency patients away after getting flooded over the weekend, it was a brutal reminder that even some of the worlds richest cities are dangerously unprepared for the kind of extreme weather that is becoming more common and more severe because of climate change. Climate and infrastructure experts have been warning for years that London, like many other large cities, isnt ready for climate change, with large parts of the city built on a flood plain and a Victorian drainage system that is unable to withstand this kind of intense rain. Its deeply concerning that were seeing hospital emergency departments having to close because they flooded, something certainly needs to be done to make sure that critical infrastructure is not at risk, said Liz Stephens, associate professor at the department of geography and environmental science at the University of Reading. According to the Greater London Authority, 17% of London is facing either high or medium risk of flooding, with more than 1 million Londoners live in a flood plain. The city has built a giant flood defense system on the river Thames to protect itself from tidal flooding, but the barriers are of little help when it comes to flash flooding caused by sudden heavy rainfall  the sort that is becoming more common because of rising temperatures. Images from Sunday showed Londoners taken by surprise, wandering through flooded streets. Some even attempting to drive away through the rising water, which officials warn against because of the high likelihood for automobiles to be swept away, or for the drivers to become trapped. The London Fire Brigade said Monday it took over 1,000 emergency calls related to the flooding with crews rescuing people from cars and helping them flee their homes. While these images of people not taking the risk seriously are concerning, Stephens said individuals were hardly to blame here. Our ability to map the risk of surface water flooding is not particularly good, Stephens said. He noted UKs surface water flood risk maps have not been improved significantly since 2013, even though more precise technology is available and despite the fact that numerous reports have been published that emphasize the increasing risk. On top of that, the way flood risk is monitored and managed in the UK is extremely complicated, with different bodies responsible for different parts of the effort and no single body in charge. The Met Office, the UKs national weather service, issued weather warnings for heavy rainfall and thunderstorms on Sunday, but Stephens said these may not be immediately understood by people. I think there was an amber warning which tells you that that there could well be severe impacts, but the amber warning covered a very large area of southeast England, said Stephens. So really as an individual, what would you do with that kind of information. If you dont know that your property is at risk of flooding, and youve got some very broad scale flood warning, or not even a flood warning, a warning of intense rainfall, then I dont think we can be surprised if people are unprepared for it, she said. A report into the impacts of climate change on the UK published last month by the governments independent climate advisory group, the Climate Change Committee, warned the country was not ready, saying that adaptation action has failed to keep pace with the worsening reality of climate risk. The risk is always greater in the urban environment because weve got concreted surfaces, but were also relying on an old drainage infrastructure in London, were talking about Victorian drains, Stephens said. Images like those coming from London on Sunday are becoming worryingly familiar. Just two weeks ago, devastating floods caused by heavy rains swept across large parts of western Europe, leaving more than 200 people dead and thousands homeless. On the other side of the world, much of Chinas central Henan province was left devastated after record rains there last week, killing at least 58, cut off power and forced the relocation of more than 1 million people. And while it is not possible to attribute a single event to climate change, heavy rains and floods are becoming more common. As the Earths atmosphere warms, it can hold more moisture, which can lead to unprecedented rainfall. It may be that the total average rainfall in an area doesnt change, but extremes are amplified, which can mean longer dry periods or more intense storms. When heavy rain hits after prolonged drought, the soils are less able to absorb the water and the rain is more likely to result in flooding. Urban areas are at higher risk of flash flooding because surfaces are covered with concrete, which means the ground cannot absorb any water. According to the European Environmental Agency, Paris, Thessaloniki, Bucharest and Barcelona among the cities with more than three quarters of their surface area sealed, meaning they are at higher risk of surface flooding. On top of that, many European cities rely on very old infrastructure, and sewage systems cannot cope with heavier rainfall. Summer thunderstorms are not a new occurrence, but it is becoming ever clearer that the worsening impacts of flooding from intense rainfall are having devastating effects here in the UK and across Europe, Jess Neumann, a hydrologist at the University of Reading, said in a comment to Science Media Center. The severity and frequency of flooding is a stark warning that we are not prepared to deal with climate change.",26/07/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/26/europe/london-flooding-infrastructure-climate-intl-cmd/index.html
"As wildfires worsen, firefighters are on the front lines of climate change","Firefighters in the West have witnessed loss beyond measure and are yet again gearing up for another devastating fire season, especially in California. Jesse Alexander, the chief for the Yuba City Fire Department in California, and his crew have been on the front lines of some of the most destructive California wildfires in history, including the Camp Fire in 2018, which killed 85 people and devastated the town of Paradise. And he says now the fire is really hitting close to home. During the Camp Fire, I looked across at guys who live in Paradise, not knowing if their house is there, said Alexander. Its completely different when you are fighting a fire in your own community. We are used to seeing destruction, but when its in your own backyard, it makes such a significant impact. So far this year, California has seen three times the acres burned compared to last years record-breaking fire season. California is currently in its 11th driest year on record, and has already broken over 1,500 daily high temperature records this year  17 of those were all-time high temperatures. Eleven of the last 15 most destructive fires in California history occurred in the last five years. Last week, Alexanders department was split between fighting the Dixie Fire and the Tamarack Fire. The blaze has now reached megafire status as it has burned over 160,000 acres. Its burning the same region that the Chips Fire scorched in 2012. Alexander said he sees that climate change is having an impact on the way wildfires behave, and hes concerned about the safety of his crew. Conditions are definitely changing. You are seeing these erratic fire events happen more frequently, he said. Its one thing to be smart and savvy with your fire behavior analysis, said Alexander, but when you get a firenado, theres not a whole lot you can do to keep yourself safe and that always makes me nervous. Extraordinary plumes of wildfire smoke are billowing out of these massive complexes, reaching so far up into the atmosphere that they are being carried thousands of miles east by high-level winds. There were few clouds in the Northeast on Tuesday morning, but the smoke  carried on a 3,000-mile trip across the country  created a hazy start to the day. In some areas, the smoke has reached the ground level, where it can be a health concern. Air quality alerts have been issued hundreds of miles from the flames, as far east as Pennsylvania and New York. The smoke at high levels of the atmosphere is visible in several ways. Its effect on light causes the sun to look red at sunset as the sky takes on a burnt-orange color. A similar effect can be seen in the morning as the sun rises. How clear is the air where you live? Despite some much-needed rainfall last week, the drought expanded in the West and now covers more than 95% of the region. More than two-thirds of the West in extreme or exceptional drought  the two worst categories. This area has expanded by 60,000 square miles, or about the size of the state of Georgia, during the month of July. In particular, conditions deteriorated in the Pacific Northwest where there was significant expansion of the worst drought categories. Washington state had previously been spared the worst category of drought until last week when it exploded to cover more than a quarter of the state. The drought is the worst on record for Oregon, with 17% in the most severe category, an area that has nearly quadrupled in the month of July. Six states are still entirely in drought conditions: Oregon, Idaho, California, Nevada, Utah and North Dakota. Robust rains the past few days, courtesy of the Southwest Monsoon, have brought some improvement in the Southwest, particularly in parts of Arizona, New Mexico and southwestern Colorado. How much improvement the recent rain will be for the drought is yet to be seen. The number of acres burned by the Bootleg fire in Oregon. On July 19th, the Log and Bootleg Fires merged together forming the third largest fire in Oregon history. The blaze has grown so big and it is producing so much heat that is has essentially created its own weather. This fire is also burning up carbon offsets and is up to 53% contained. A total of 85 other large fires are currently burning across 12 states today. At least 33 people are dead and several more are still missing in central China, after devastating floods triggered landslides, overwhelmed dams and rivers, and submerged entire neighborhoods. Residents of the city of Zhengzhou saw 18 inches (457 mm) of rain fall in just 24 hours. According to the Zhengzhou Meteorological Department, the city recorded over 24 inches (617 mm) of rain in the course of three days, which is just under a years worth of rainfall  25.2 inches (640.8 mm). Flooding during the summer months in this region of China is an annual occurrence. However, the record-breaking rainfall has raised questions about whether the country is prepared to deal with more extreme weather events that can be amplified by climate change.",26/07/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/26/weather/climate-impacts-wildfires-drought-weather-wxn/index.html
The amount of Greenland ice that melted on Tuesday could cover Florida in 2 inches of water,"Greenland is experiencing its most significant melting event of the year as temperatures in the Arctic surge. The amount of ice that melted on Tuesday alone would be enough to cover the entire state of Florida in two inches of water. Its the third instance of extreme melting in the past decade, during which time the melting has stretched farther inland than the entire satellite era, which began in the 1970s. Greenland lost more than 8.5 billion tons of surface mass on Tuesday, and 18.4 billion tons since Sunday, according to the Denmark Meteorological Institute. While this weeks total ice loss is not as extreme as a similar event in 2019  a record melt year  the area of the ice sheet thats melting is larger. Its a significant melt, Ted Scambos, a senior research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado, told CNN. July 27th saw most of the eastern half of Greenland from the northern tip all the way to the southern tip mostly melted, which is unusual. As human-caused climate change warms the planet, ice loss has increased rapidly. According to a recent study published in the journal Cryosphere, Earth has lost a staggering 28 trillion tonnes of ice since the mid-1990s, a large portion of which was from the Arctic, including the Greenland ice sheet. In the past decade, weve already seen that surface melting in Greenland has become both more severe and more erratic, said Thomas Slater, a glaciologist at the University of Leeds and a co-author on that report. As the atmosphere continues to warm over Greenland, events such as yesterdays extreme melting will become more frequent. Although the current ice meltdown in Greenland isnt record-setting, the magnitude at which these events occur is a clear signal of how climate change is creating more melt periods. Overall, were seeing that Greenland melts more often, said Scambos, who also authors the National Snow and Ice Data Centers Greenland updates. In previous decades or centuries, its extremely rare to get above freezing temperatures at the summit of Greenland. In 2019, Greenland shed roughly 532 billion tons of ice into the sea. During that year, an unexpectedly hot spring and a July heat wave caused almost the entire ice sheets surface to begin melting. Global sea level rose permanently by 1.5 millimeters as a result. As Greenlands surface continues to thaw, Slater said coastal cities around the world are vulnerable to storm-surge flooding, especially when extreme weather coincides with high tides. Melting from Greenland is expected to raise global sea level between 2 and 10 centimeters by the end of the century, he added. Massive ice sheets can melt rapidly when the air temperature is warm. But warmer ocean water is also eroding the ice sheet around the edges. As humans release heat-trapping greenhouse gas, the warming atmosphere thaws the fresh white ice  which reflects the suns energy back into space  on the surface. That exposes the darker ice below which absorbs solar energy and causes more melting. Additionally, warmer coastal water melts the ice sheet around the edges, breaking off massive icebergs that contribute to sea level rise. Scientists say the trends at which climate change is accelerating are quite clear, and that unless emissions are curbed, such extreme events will continue to occur more frequently. While such events are concerning, the science is clear, Slater said. Meaningful climate targets and action can still limit how much the global sea level will rise this century, reducing the damage done by severe flooding to people and infrastructure around the world.",29/07/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/29/us/greenland-ice-melting-climate-change/index.html
"Curbing climate change is auto mechanics, not rocket science","With the gas mileage and auto pollution decisions President Joe Biden is expected to announce in coming days, environmentalists are increasingly worried the administration will yield to automakers pressure and adopt modest limits on greenhouse gas emissions from cars, instead of the strict standards they say are necessary to combat climate change. The United States can begin to take the biggest single step of any nation in the fight against climate change. The President must set tough rules that restore, and later strengthen, tailpipe emissions standards that President Donald Trump trashed while putting us on course to phase in a new car fleet that is 100% electric by 2030. Bidens actions will shape US greenhouse gas levels  and what we drive  for generations and send a message to the world that we are serious about fighting what he has called the existential threat of global warming. Every gallon of gasoline we burn, whether in a hybrid vehicle or a Hummer, emits 25 pounds of carbon dioxide, the heat-trapping gas that is most responsible for warming the planet. Transportation spews more of that primary global warming pollutant than even power plants. So, we cant tame climate change without aggressively reining in gas-guzzling and emissions from SUVs, pickups, minivans and cars. Nine years ago, automakers and President Barack Obama reached a deal to make 5% annual improvements in gas mileage and emissions. Automakers added cost-effective efficiency technology they had sitting on their shelves, such as improved engines, transmissions and aerodynamics, to make their vehicles guzzle and pollute less. Fully enforced, by 2025, the standards would have delivered a new car fleet averaging 36 miles per gallon, compared to 24.9 mpg today. Furthermore, those standards would have kept six billion tons of CO2 out of the atmosphere while saving consumers $1 trillion on gas. But in 2017, four days after Trump took office, auto company CEOs returned to the White House, asking to roll back the very rules they had negotiated with his predecessor. Trump complied, effectively freezing mileage and emissions at 2020 levels for the next six years  and saddling the country with a fleet averaging no better than 29 mpg, costing consumers more at the pump. As a first step, with his upcoming decisions, President Biden must reinstate the Obama-era standards. Manufacturers are taking advantage of Trumps rollback. They are rolling out prodigious numbers of gas-guzzling SUVs and other light trucks and slapping on monster markups  for as much as $30,000 and more on some. Most of these trucks haul little more than a latte from Starbucks. Some automakers assert that they may plow some of these hefty profits into making EVs. But so far most carmakers have produced many promises but only a relative handful of EVs compared to the 17 million gas-powered cars, pickups and SUVs they churn out annually. Notwithstanding their big talk about an electric future, automakers are devoting a huge share of their roughly $14 billion annual marketing budget to pushing the gas-guzzling trucks on consumers. Ford sold barely 11,000 EVs in the 12 months ending in April  and 800,000 gas-powered F-150 pickups in 2020. Yet the company asserts it anticipates its 2030 global production will be 40% electric. With its track record, the new electric F-150 it has dubbed the Lightning may be more Tinkerbell than Thor. General Motors declaration that it aspires to eliminate tailpipe emissions by 2035 and go carbon neutral by 2040 is a far cry from pledging to halt production of gas-engine vehicles. We wont build back better banking on automakers hopes. Last summer, the California Air Resources Board completed a feeble agreement with Ford, Honda, Volkswagen, BMW and Volvo that Dave Cooke, a Union of Concerned Scientists senior vehicles analyst, told us would cut emissions by only half what the Obama rules would have saved. Automakers seized on it as a model for the rest of the country. Dont be bamboozled. Applied nationally to all automakers, the mileage and pollution savings would be so slight that they would extend Trumps climate reach through most of Bidens term. Dressing up those loophole-riddled Swiss cheese rules as a revived Obama plan would leave Biden far from his central  and crucial  climate goal: Bringing carbon dioxide emissions to near zero by 2050. We wont fend off climate catastrophe with anything less than bold steps. We have no choice but to phase out internal combustion engines in new vehicles, and the pollution they emit, by 2030. Just do the math: Many SUVs and other light trucks and cars sold in 2030 will last 20 years. They will still be rolling in 2050. Carbon dioxide persists for hundreds of years. So, with the invisible, ubiquitous tenacity of Lewis Carrols Cheshire cat, the pollution will foul our atmosphere  and overheat the globe  far into the 22nd century. Cutting emissions and boosting gas mileage by 7% a year  two percentage points more than the companies agreed to a decade ago  will ensure that the tens of millions of gas-powered vehicles built between now and 2030 wont bar us from protecting the climate. This is auto mechanics, not rocket science. Nearly a decade ago, automakers started to meet Obamas 5% yearly improvements by using more efficient transmissions; safe, lightweight, high-strength steel and aluminum, and aerodynamic designs. If they fully deploy these and other efficiency technologies in all their vehicles, they can achieve the imperative 7% gains while phasing in EVs. Heres a bonus: the technology will save more than it costs. If Biden takes bold action now  boosting gas mileage, scrapping loopholes, and plugging in  he can make history as the president who tackled the growing climate crisis. Global warmings challenge demands no less.",01/08/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/01/opinions/greenhouse-gas-emissions-automaker-industry-climate-change-becker/index.html
A crucial ocean circulation is showing signs of instability. Its shutdown would have serious impacts on our weather.,"A crucial system of currents in the Atlantic Ocean that helps control temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere and has implications for the entire planets weather systems is showing signs of instability due to human-made climate change, scientists say. Its collapse would have dire consequences for our weather and life on Earth. The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)  which the Gulf Stream is a major part of  helps maintain the energy balance in the Atlantic Ocean. It is often described as a conveyor belt that takes warm surface water from the tropics and distributes it to the north Atlantic. The colder, saltier water then sinks and flows south. A study, published Thursday in Nature and Climate Change, warned of an almost complete loss of stability of the AMOC over the course of the last century. Researchers say it could be close to a collapse from a strong circulation to a weak circulation, though the threshold for such a collapse is still uncertain. Scientists have warned for years that the circulation is weakening. Heavy rain and melting ice sheets are making the water in the North Atlantic Ocean less salty, which makes it lighter and less likely to sink. If the water in this region becomes too light, the entire circulation could be disrupted. Global weather patterns are critically linked to the circulation and its transport of heat and nutrients around the planet. A collapse of this system would result in significant and abrupt changes, including fast sea level rise, more extreme winters in Western Europe and disruptions to monsoon systems in the tropics. It could also have a cascading effect and destabilize other components of the Earths climate system, including the Antarctic ice sheet and the Amazon rainforest. This scenario was the premise for the 2004 climate science fiction film The Day After Tomorrow, in which a series of extreme weather disasters strike after climate change caused the AMOC to collapse. The circulation is weaker than it has been in around 1,000 years, scientists had previously said, but they did not know whether it had actually been destabilized or undergoing natural changes. This weeks study used eight datasets looking at surface temperatures and salinity in the North Atlantic over a period of 150 years, and found global warming was driving the destabilization. The difference is crucial, the studys author, Niklas Boers from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, told CNN in an email. Imagine a chair, which can be either shifted (with all four legs remaining on the ground) or tilted. Both change the position of the chair (corresponding to the change in mean AMOC strength), but in the first case the stability of the chair wont be affected, while in the latter case there exists a critical point. If we tilt the chair just slightly further, it will fall down. My results suggest that what is happening to the AMOC is more likely to be a tilting than only a shifting, so the AMOC has moved toward the critical threshold at which it may collapse, he said. Boers added that he himself was surprised by his findings that the AMOC had been destabilized and was moving toward its critical threshold, at which it could abruptly collapse. A collapse of the circulation would mean significant cooling in Europe, Beors said, but maybe more concerning is the effect of an AMOC collapse on the tropical monsoon systems of South America, Western Africa, and India; especially in Western Africa, an AMOC collapse could lead to permanent drought conditions. Boers recognizes in his study that he and other scientists still dont know if and when the current might collapse, but he called on the world to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as much and as quickly as possible. Every gram of extra greenhouse gas in the atmosphere will increase to the probability of an AMOC collapse in the future, so emitting as little as possible, both on individual but of course also on collective and international level, is the key. The study comes ahead of a major report by the UNs International Panel on Climate Change on Monday, which has been years in the making and is expected to provide the most conclusive look yet at the extent of human-made climate change. It will also likely paint a picture of what the future could look like, depending on what action the world takes to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions.",06/08/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/06/world/climate-gulf-stream-collapse-warning-study-intl/index.html
Global businesses must address climate change before it? too late,"Climate change poses one of the greatest threats humanity has ever faced. In the past few weeks alone, wildfires have emerged across the globe, brutal heatwaves have devastated American cities, and flooding has claimed the lives of hundreds in Europe and Asia combined. As the effects of climate change wear on, these extreme events will likely only get worse. Making meaningful, measurable progress is a monumental task. For the sake of the planet and future generations, it is vital that global businesses, and the professionals who run them, step up in the fight against climate change and take urgent action. Heres how: At the recent G7 Summit, world leaders doubled down on their climate pledges, focusing on the opportunity for a just energy transition that will likely create clean energy jobs around the world. Among other things, they committed to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, halve their collective emissions by 2030, and protect at least 30% of land and oceans by 2030. The business community must match the ambition of world governments by cutting emissions across their own operations. Hundreds of companies have now taken the first step in doing so: committing to 100% renewable energy. The tech sector in particular has been leading this shift, with a number of companies already reaching their 100% goal, and many more setting science-based plans to get there. Companies must analyze the financial risks that climate change poses to them  and publicly disclose that information. Global capital markets need high-quality, consistent and comparable data to understand drivers of risk and return, allocate capital efficiently and finance the transition to a more resilient, low-carbon economy. By providing financial markets with the right information, we can build confidence that money flows where it needs to go to boost resiliency and curb emissions across the globe. This means companies exposed to long-term climate-related risks may see higher costs of doing business while companies that develop climate solutions could have access to cheaper capital. We are seeing this play out already. Allianz, for instance, will no longer offer property or casualty insurance coverage to mining companies that plan new coal mines. And BlackRock is setting limits on its investments in companies that are exposed to climate risks. I am encouraged that businesses are increasingly reporting on the impact of climate change and taking steps to increase transparency and accountability through initiatives like the World Economic Forums Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics, a set of environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosures that companies can report on. The recent pledge from the G7 to adopt climate reporting standards reinforces the direction that the regulatory environment is heading in. As business leaders, we need to recognize that our people are our greatest asset  our superpower. With organization-wide climate education programs, businesses can develop a culture of sustainability and climate-conscious thinking at the very core of their work. That is why, starting this month, Deloitte has begun to roll out a new climate learning program for all 330,000 of its professionals worldwide. Developed in collaboration with World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the program is designed to engage our people on the impacts of climate change, inform them about how we are responding and inspire them to take action. By building a workforce of climate advocates and a culture of climate action, we will create a network of support for a transition to sustainable business models with far-reaching influence. Businesses must leverage their collective power to advocate for climate policies that meet the ambition of reaching net-zero by 2050 or earlier. Alongside fellow CEOs from across the world, I recently signed on to a call for government leaders to place a price on carbon and invest in the infrastructure needed to accelerate a transition away from fossil fuels. Companies ranging from shipping and logistics giants to major retailers have taken similar steps to drive systemic change in recent years. And even the oil and gas sector has lent its support for carbon pricing. I call on other leaders to rise to this challenge. They must make climate knowledge a core competency across their businesses  a springboard for greater action  and take concrete steps to address the climate crisis head-on. Watching the world come together to fight Covid-19 has been nothing short of inspiring, but as communities begin to recover from the pandemic, they cannot revert to the previous way of doing things. Lets build on this global cooperation that we know is possible and step up to the next greatest challenge humanity has ever confronted. For companies to build long-term sustainable value for all stakeholders, they must do their part to build an equitable and sustainable future. Our future depends on it.",09/08/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/09/perspectives/climate-change-deloitte-global-ceo-punit-renjen/index.html
"Earth is warming faster than previously thought, scientists say, and the window is closing to avoid catastrophic outcomes","As the world battles historic droughts, landscape-altering wildfires and deadly floods, a landmark report from global scientists says the window is rapidly closing to cut our reliance on fossil fuels and avoid catastrophic changes that would transform life as we know it. The state-of-the-science report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says the world has rapidly warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius higher than pre-industrial levels, and is now careening toward 1.5 degrees  a critical threshold that world leaders agreed warming should remain below to avoid worsening impacts. Only by making deep cuts to greenhouse gas emissions, while also removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, can we halt the precipitous trend. Bottom line is that we have zero years left to avoid dangerous climate change, because its here, Michael E. Mann, a lead author of the IPCCs 2001 report, told CNN. Unlike previous assessments, Mondays report concludes it is unequivocal that humans have caused the climate crisis and confirms that widespread and rapid changes have already occurred, some of them irreversibly. That is due in part to the breakneck pace at which the planet has been recently warming, faster than scientists have previously observed. Since 2018, when the panel published a special report on the significance of 1.5-degrees, greenhouse gas emissions have continued mostly unabated and have pushed global temperatures higher. Even under the IPCCs most optimistic scenario, in which the worlds emissions begin to drop sharply today and are reduced to net zero by 2050, global temperature will still peak above the 1.5-degree threshold before falling. In a statement, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the report a code red for humanity, and noted the 1.5-degree threshold is perilously close. The only way to prevent exceeding this threshold is by urgently stepping up our efforts, and pursuing the most ambitious path, Guterres said. The IPCC report comes just three months before the UN-led international climate change talks, during which global leaders are expected to strengthen their commitments to cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Though some countries have pledged stricter cuts since the 2015 Paris Agreement, many have missed deadlines to do so, and there is still a significant gap between what leaders are promising and whats needed by 2030. From a scientific perspective, every degree, every part of a degree, every half of a degree matters in terms of limiting the impacts that we will see from climate change, Ko Barrett, the former vice chair of the IPCC, told CNN. So at whatever level countries decide is what theyre aiming for, there are benefits and there are consequences to choosing those limits. Dave Reay, the director of the Edinburgh Climate Change Institute, said world leaders must have the findings of this report seared into their minds at the November conference and take urgent action. This is not just another scientific report, Reay said. This is hell and highwater writ large. As computing power increases, scientists are more confident than ever in connecting the dots between the climate crisis and extreme weather, which for some regions  even at 1.1 degrees of warming  is already becoming unbearable. Michael Byrne, a climate researcher at the University of Oxford, said thats whats different about this report is the effects of global warming are no longer in the distant future or in far-flung corners of the world. We knew what was coming and now its here, Byrne said. A heat wave that killed hundreds this summer in the US Northwest and British Columbia would have been virtually impossible without the climate crisis, researchers found. It made Hurricane Harveys devastating rainfall roughly three times more likely to occur and 15% more intense, scientists said. Harvey dumped more than 19 trillion gallons of water on Texas and Louisiana in 2017, triggering devastating floods in the Houston area. The IPCC says heavy rainfall that used to occur once every 10 years now occurs 30% more frequently. Globally, droughts that may have occurred only once every 10 years or so now happen 70% more frequently, according to the report. The climate change connection is particularly strong in the Western United States, which is experiencing a historic, multiyear drought that has drained reservoirs and triggered water shortages. Amid unrelenting drought and record heat, wildfire seasons are now longer and result in more destructive fires. Six of the top 10 largest fires in California have occurred in 2020 or 2021, according to CalFire. Were seeing truly frightening fire behavior. I dont know how to overstate that, said Chris Carlton, supervisor of Californias Plumas National Forest supervisor in California, who called this years wildfire season uncharted territory. Charles Koven, a lead author of the reports chapter on global carbon cycles, said California has already reached a tipping point on wildfires. I dont think we knew where that threshold was until we crossed it, he told CNN. What the report makes clear is that the likelihood of crossing any of these tipping points is certainly going to increase the more warming that we see. With every fraction of a degree of warming, the effects worsen. Even limiting warming to 1.5 degrees, which countries in the Paris Agreement determined was ideal to stave off the worst impacts, the kinds of extreme weather the world has experienced this summer will become more severe and more frequent. Beyond 1.5 degrees, scientists say the climate system could begin to look unrecognizable. Andrew Watson, a scientist at the University of Exeter, said the climate models used in the report dont capture the risk of low probability, high impact events that become more likely as global temperature increases. These are events such as ice sheet collapse, sudden changes in ocean circulation, or catastrophic wildfires, Watson said. These known unknowns are scarier still. The roughly 3,500-page report is a culmination of nearly a decade of climate research by scientists around the world. And although the IPCC is considered the ultimate source on climate change, it tends to be conservative in its findings because of the way its developed  by having hundreds of scientists come to a consensus not only on the research but the language describing it. Yet Mondays report uses the strongest wording to date in describing the climate crisis. Ice sheets are melting and will continue to melt; extreme flooding from higher sea level will continue to get more frequent; and sea level itself will continue to rise well into the 22nd century, simply because of the amount of heat the oceans have already trapped. At the same time scientists are sounding the alarm, the International Energy Agency says human carbon emissions are on course to surge by 1.5 billion tonnes in 2021  the second-largest increase in history  reversing most of last years decline caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. The IPCC report is clear that global leaders must cut greenhouse gas emissions now, before deadly and costly weather extremes get even worse. But Barrett said a key message in the report is that its still possible to prevent the most dire impacts. It really requires unprecedented transformational change, rapid and immediate reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, said Barrett. The idea that there is still a pathway forward is a point that should give us some hope.",09/08/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/09/world/global-climate-change-report-un-ipcc/index.html
"?inal warning? Lawmakers, Biden administration sound alarm over UN climate report and urge swift action","Lawmakers and top climate officials in President Joe Bidens administration sounded the alarm on Monday in response to a new report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, urging nations to swiftly limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. If Senators truly followed the science in this report, wed have 100 votes for climate action to match the 100 percent certainty that human-caused climate change is destroying our planet, Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts said in a statement. This report must be the final warning to the world that time has run out to save the planet from dangerous and irreversible climate change. The latest IPCC report finds the world is rapidly running out of time to keep human-caused global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The report lays out different scenarios if world nations decarbonize and collectively limit their warming to 1.5 degrees, compared to what will happen if they dont take action  leading to global warming of 2 or 3 degrees Celsius. The latter would have catastrophic consequences for the planet, leading to already severe weather events like fires and flooding getting worse. Every bit of warming matters, and every bit of avoided warming matters, Dr. Jane Lubchenco, the deputy director for climate and environment at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, told CNN. We have to enhance ambition and tackle the climate crisis like the existential threat that it is. With global warming currently at 1.1 degrees Celsius, this summer has already set new records for heat and drought in parts of the United States. Some lawmakers said they feared this summer could be tip of the iceberg. Its not as if this year were experiencing is going to be a blip, its going to be the best-case scenario if we dont make changes, Democratic Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota told CNN. Ranchers are liquidating their cattle herds because they cant find hay, part of the [Minnesota] boundary waters is closed off because of fire danger. I think about my grandson; is he even going to know snow in Minnesota? Smith and other lawmakers said the new report underscored the need for congressional Democrats to pass a $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation bill including strong climate provisions, including tax credits for renewable energy, and a Clean Electricity Standard. We cannot afford to squander this once-in-a-generation opportunity to deliver historic investments in clean energy, good-paying jobs, and environmental justice, said Rep. Kathy Castor, who chairs the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis. Top Senate Democrats released new details Monday on the climate provisions in their upcoming $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation bill, which would included a new Clean Electricity Payment Program, clean energy, manufacturing, and transportation tax incentives and grants, funding for a Civilian Climate Corps, new polluter fees on methane and carbon imports, and consumer rebates for home electrification and weatherization, among other things. By finally tackling climate change, we can spare our country and our planet the most devastating effects of global warming, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York wrote in a Dear Colleague letter. Many lawmakers believe that passing a robust reconciliation bill is their best hope to achieve President Bidens goal of slashing greenhouse gas emissions by 50 to 52 percent relative to 2005 levels by 2030. Biden has also said he wants to get the United States to net-zero emissions by 2050, and decarbonize the US electricity sector by 2035. This is really a double wake-up call, said Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas, who chairs the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology. I think finally were beginning to accept weve got to do something. The Biden administration on Monday also announced $5 billion in funding through the Federal Emergency Management Agency aimed at helping states and localities prepare for extreme weather and climate-related disasters. That funding will go toward grants for communities to reduce vulnerability to natural hazard events, additional grants for hazard mitigation, and funding for flood mitigation grants, according to a news release. The world must come together before the ability to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius is out of reach, said US Climate Envoy John Kerry in response to the IPCC report. What the world requires now is real action. We can get to the low carbon economy we urgently need, but time is not on our side. Biden and lawmakers have a series of crucial steps this summer and fall. The bulk of budget reconciliation will likely happen in September and October, teeing up the crucial United Nations Climate Change Conference where the US and other nations will meet to discuss decarbonization commitments. As Bidens top international climate official, Kerry will have a crucial role to play in the coming international talks in Glasgow, Scotland later this fall. In a statement, Kerry said Glasgow must be a turning point in this crisis where all major economies commit to aggressive action on climate during the next decade. Kerrys comments were also echoed by Secretary of State Tony Blinken. We cannot delay ambitious climate action any longer, Blinken said in a statement. This moment requires world leaders, the private sector, and individuals to act together with urgency and do everything it takes to protect our planet and our future in this decade and beyond.",09/08/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/09/politics/un-climate-report-us-lawmakers/index.html
Stop blaming yourself for the climate crisis,"I live in a valley surrounded by jagged mountains  the kind that attract the Winter Olympics. This weekend, wildfire smoke was so thick that it blotted them out completely, making Utah look like the Great Plains. The sun was reduced to a pinhole of hellish red. Anyone who stepped outside felt their chest close, and some went to the hospital. This isnt breaking news. Smoke is now a quotidian feature of summer in the American West. These semi-apocalyptic scenarios  not just fires, but rising seas, floods, drought, extinction  will become a horrific normal unless governments move at breakneck speed to not just reduce but eliminate fossil fuel pollution in our lifetimes. That fact, which the leaders of the worlds biggest economies and governments have been talking about for decades now, was blatantly obvious in the pages of a report released Monday by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Scientists from around the world found that burning fossil fuels already has pushed the planet more than 1 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels. We could cross the critical 1.5-degree threshold of warming around 2030, and we are on pace to unleash a catastrophic 3 degrees of warming by about 2100. These numbers sound abstract, but they are the keys to how the world looks and feels for us and for future generations  the keys to whether New York is underwater or whether the Amazon dries up; to whether the West remains habitable and whether millions globally continue to die each year from fossil-fuel pollution. Climate change is a complex game of probability, but the underlying truth could not be clearer: We must stop burning fossil fuels  coal, oil, natural gas  as soon as possible. Less pollution equals less warming and less danger. None of this is truly new. The first IPCC released its first report on global warming in 1990, two years after NASA scientist James Hansen testified before the US Senate that global warming had begun. Whats new is that the global public is waking up to these dangers. We feel them in our day-to-day lives. We also are smart enough to realize that this isnt our fault. For decades, fossil-fuel companies and politicians have pushed a false narrative that if we change our habits  drive electric cars, fly less, cut beef from our diets  that they wont need to make wholesale changes to the economy. Individual actions matter in that they can reduce emissions, and they do connect each of us to a massive global crisis. All of thats good. But, alone, it is nowhere near enough to battle the climate crisis on the scale thats required. The narrative must shift from one of individual responsibility  if I turn off this lightbulb, Im saving the planet  to one of governmental and corporate accountability. In the United States, this means the voting public must force Congress to enact sweeping climate legislation. The Biden administration says it aims to make this country carbon-neutral by 2050, which is in line with what the science requires. Lawmakers will have to get us there, however, and to date they have not shown that they are willing (or able) to make the kinds of changes needed. The United States must make significant legislative strides to signal its commitment to change in order to have any relevance at the international climate negotiations taking place later this year in Glasgow, Scotland. The current focus is a $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation bill that includes a Clean Electricity Standard, along with other strong climate provisions. Better still would be passing a national carbon tax that could make polluting far more expensive. It does appear that most Americans understand the urgency here. An estimated 52% of Americans say that global warming should be a high priority for Congress and the president, according to a 2020 national survey from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. More of us must join this struggle in ways that put institutional accountability ahead of individual behavior. Without more constant pressure from citizens, governments and corporations will continue doing what they have been for decades now  saying they support clean energy while continuing to spew deadly pollutants into the atmosphere. Its natural to step outside into wildfire smoke or record temperatures or extreme storms and think this is hopeless. Its not hopeless. And its not your fault. Please try to banish those thoughts from your mind. Instead, pressure your government to end the fossil fuel era. Depending on your politics, you could do that by joining national or local groups that are pushing for a carbon-neutral future. Read up on solutions like those assessed by the non-profit Project Drawdown. Write to or call your US senators and tell them that you vote on climate and expect them to do so as well. This is a code red moment for humanity, as the UN secretary-general put it recently. Its also a moment when humans can prove were capable of creating a safer and healthier future.",09/08/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/09/opinions/climate-crisis-ipcc-report-john-sutter/index.html
Key takeaways from the UN report on the climate crisis,"Mondays report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) represents the most comprehensive and conclusive state of the science on the climate crisis: why it is happening, how it is impacting every region of the planet, how much worse things are set to get and what must be done to avoid the worst consequences. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the report a code red for humanity, noting that global heating is affecting every region on Earth, with many of the changes becoming irreversible. The report is around 3,500 pages, represents years of research on the topic, was authored by more than 200 scientists from over 60 countries and cites more than 14,000 individual studies. Here are are some specific impacts and what the report has to say about them. IPCC reports, while long on science and exhaustive in scope and detail, contain precious little in suggesting policy to remedy the climate crisis. This report, for example, is purely the scientific facts and forecasts for the future. Major IPCC reports coming next year will go into more detail on specific impacts and ways to mitigate them, but before then global leaders will meet at a UN-led climate conference in November, in what is being billed as the most consequential climate policy meeting since the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015. As todays report makes clear, there is no time for delay and no room for excuses, the UN secretary-general declared this morning, as he implored government leaders to ensure COP26 is a success in order to avert climate catastrophe.",09/08/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/09/world/ipcc-climate-key-takeaways/index.html
The rainy day strategy to fight global climate change,"The sixth version of the IPCC climate report was released on Monday, and it predicts a dire future. Global warming is advancing dangerously and in ways that will change the lives of our children. The report is 1,300 pages of serious and well considered science. It  or at least the executive summary  should be required reading for everyone. There is no credible argument against the fact that ongoing use of carbon dioxide-emitting fossil fuels are a danger to the Earth. The data is compelling and has been tabulated by many trusted scientific agencies including the National Academy of Sciences and its international analogue, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, as well as many others. The shift to greener energy sources is inevitable, as is the need for more energy as the worlds population both increases and developing countries join the developed world. But there are still technical issues to be ironed out for some green energy sources. There is disagreement on what constitutes green power. While I personally am in favor of increased nuclear electrical generation, there are those who find Fukushima, Chernobyl and Three Mile Island to be worrisome enough to reject this nuclear energy as green. I admit that there is need for increased safety, but to me, nuclear energy is superior to what weve been doing. And there certainly is enormous power to be extracted from the center of uranium nuclei. But even those people who dismiss nuclear energy will generally agree that green power includes wind, solar and sometimes water waves. However, there is an enormous shortcoming associated with some of these technologies, easily pointed out by anyone, and that is that the sun doesnt shine all day, there are cloudy days, and wind is a chancy thing in many locales. So how do you store all of that energy for use at night or on a windless day? Quite literally, green technologies need to save energy for a rainy day. One idea is to use excess energy on sunny or windy days to pump water back up into a reservoir, so that during times of energy need, the water in the reservoir can be used to turn turbines. Another option is to convert water into hydrogen and oxygen, which can then be burned when needed, leaving only energy and water as a byproduct. Both of these are promising. However, the most commonly discussed technology is to use batteries to store the energy generated by intermittent green sources of power. And that is a great idea, but to roll out batteries in great quantities, you need to consider practical factors, like cost and the total amount of energy that can be stored. A recent advance by a company located in the Boston area, by the name of Form Energy has potentially devised a technology that could make a big impact on green energy. They are touting their new battery which uses iron and oxygen. This technology will absorb energy and convert rust into iron, releasing oxygen and then, when energy is needed, it will convert iron metal to rust, absorbing oxygen. Its a neat trick, if it works. Certainly, the science of rusting and de-rusting (e.g. oxygenation vs. reduction in science lingo) is well understood. After all, we turn iron ore (which is largely rust) into iron, and most people have seen rust develop on their car. So, theres no scientific mystery here. The real questions are how much does it cost and how fast does the battery drain and recharge? Maybe an even more basic question is does it work? Form Energy claims two things. One is that the cost for energy storage with an iron-oxygen exchange battery is less than $20 per kilowatt hour. The second is that this battery will last for 100 hours, meaning it will supply energy during about four days of overcast or windless conditions. The iron/oxygen battery should be contrasted to the most-used high energy storage batteries currently in use, specifically lithium-ion batteries. These kinds of batteries are very common in society today. On the small scale, they are used in cell phones, cameras, iPads and stuff like that. Going bigger, they are found in saws, drills, sanders, and many construction tools. But it is the big scale where the competition between iron/air and lithium-ion batteries will take place. Currently, lithium-ion batteries are found in some Toyota Priuses, all Teslas, and many other cars, motorcycles, advanced electric wheel chairs and even the Mars Curiosity rover. And, of course, they are under consideration for use in green energy. So, whats potentially better about the iron/oxygen batteries  if they work? Well, cost is an important thing. So is the availability of lithium vs. iron. Iron is very common in the Earths crust. Averaged, over the Earth, it is the fourth most common element, weighing in at 5% of the crusts ingredients. Lithium is far rarer, coming in at about 0.004% of the Earths crust, meaning that iron is at least 1,000 times more common. Lithiums rarity has sparked conversations among strategic thinkers and even the military about where it can be found and how to protect the sources for various nations. If this new iron/oxygen technology works well, it would negate such concerns entirely. Of course, some caution is warranted. Many battery technologies have been proposed, only to fall short of needs  starting with Thomas Edisons nickel iron battery  and the Form Energy technology hasnt yet been demonstrated to the industrys satisfaction. In fact, a Washington Post article lays out these concerns in stark detail. Actual technology choices aside, it is clear that carbon dioxide released by humans is changing the Earths climate. Hurricanes and tornadoes are more and more powerful, resulting in hugely expensive recovery costs. Wildfires are becoming more common. Some crucial water reservoirs are at historic lows. The world is in danger. Humanity needs to confront these consequences before they become worse. Green energy is the most palatable solution to these issues, but the question of energy storage is a very big one. It is unclear which technology will save the day  in fact, it may well be that a smorgasbord of energy storage technologies will be used. But we must find a solution, unless humanity chooses to live in a world that is far more chaotic than the one we have now.",10/08/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/10/opinions/green-energy-technical-needs-ipcc-climate-report-lincoln/index.html
Meaningful ways individuals can put pressure on corporations to solve the climate crisis,"The climate crisis is accelerating at unprecedented pace, according to a new United Nations state-of-the-science report. It is a code red for humanity, said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres  and given that the report concludes the entirety of the warming is due to human greenhouse gas emissions, avoiding the worst of its consequences is up to us. While the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report concludes that humans are unequivocally the cause of the crisis, climate experts say the onus of solving it should not rest on individuals shoulders. Though we all should do what we can to limit our own greenhouse gas emissions, no amount of individual action  changing lightbulbs, turning up the thermostat or reducing plastic consumption  will address the magnitude of the problem, according to scientists and advocates who spoke with CNN. We need bold, global policies, they said, and lawmakers need to hold industry accountable for its role in perpetuating the crisis. Joeri Rogelj, a lead author for the UN reports chapter on global carbon cycles, says the world requires rapid change on a big scale to avoid catastrophic impacts. As an individual, there are things we can do in our own lives, but they wont be sufficient to rise up to the challenge of halting climate change, Rogelj told CNN. What is really important is structural change  and that can only be achieved through long-term thinking and long-term investments and regulations. Climate change is no longer a far off threat with nebulous outcomes. Its fueling deadly wildfires that are scorching entire towns, severe flooding and unrelenting drought that pits communities against each other. As climate anxiety runs high, Rogelj said there are meaningful ways individuals can put pressure on corporations and policymakers to make rapid, stringent cuts on planet-heating emissions. If you have savings, you can reach out to your community and put them in more environmentally friendly goals, Rogelj said. You can also talk to your decision-makers and let them know that this is an issue that you care about by writing them letters. Lisa DeVille, an Indigenous environmental activist from North Dakota, has long leveraged environmental policies to rally her community and participate in public comment hearings about polluting infrastructure. If the climate crisis feels overwhelming, engage in the political process, she said. Its good to hear international scientists echoing what most of us can see with our own eyes, DeVille said. Climate change is real and that its hurting people in our planet right now today. Ultimately, big businesses and the fossil fuel industry need to be held accountable, according to Rogelj. Corporate change took the form of ousted board members this summer when activist shareholders replaced three people on ExxonMobils board. For the first time in modern history, Americas largest oil company faced a credible challenge from an activist hedge fund, Engine No. 1, which was displeased with Exxons financial performance and what it saw as the companys foot-dragging on climate. The vote was a major milestone in the climate battle. The Engine No. 1 campaign was the first proxy campaign at a major US company in which the case for change was built around the shift away from fossil fuels. The climate crisis poses an existential threat to Exxon, one climate activists argue the company hasnt taken seriously enough. The big oil company has deployed Big Tobacco-like propaganda for decades in an effort to downplay the gravity of the climate crisis, shifting the blame to its consumers and protecting its own interests, according to a Harvard University study published earlier this year that used machine learning and algorithms to uncover trends in more than 200 public and internal Exxon documents between 1972 and 2019. In response to the study, Exxon told CNN Business in May that ExxonMobil supports the Paris climate agreement, and is working to reduce company emissions and helping customers reduce their emissions while working on new lower-emission technologies and advocating for effective policies. The Harvard study, Exxon added at the time, is clearly part of a litigation strategy against ExxonMobil and other energy companies. Months before the IPCC report was released, the International Energy Agency warned the world it needs to immediately stop drilling for oil and gas to prevent a climate catastrophe. The IEA report nudged companies toward renewables and urged milestones that included immediately stopping new gas and oil projects, halting the sale of new fossil fuel boilers starting in 2025 and increasing electric vehicle sales to at least 60% by 2030. The IEA also pointed to the economic benefits of focusing on climate change, emphasizing that the annual energy investment would surge to $5 trillion by 2030 from $2.3 trillion in recent years, adding 0.4 percentage points to global GDP growth. As the focus turns to the worlds main greenhouse gas emitters  industrial sectors like agriculture or oil and gas  climate activists are pushing against the idea of individual actions like recycling or eating less meat. We need to stop blaming ourselves and start holding the fossil fuel industry accountable for decades of disinformation and political sabotage, Jamie Henn, director of Fossil Free Media, a nonprofit media organization dedicated to the climate crisis. The concept of an individual having a carbon footprint has been emphasized in marketing campaigns designed for BP, for example, to maintain BPs image on climate change in China. In a 2007-2008 document, advertising company Ogilvy summarized the campaign: BP aims to be seen as an environmentally responsible company and supports efforts to reduce Chinas climate change impact. Encouraging environmental education among Chinese people is also a priority for BP. Ogilvy also noted that, at the time, there had been over 500,000 visits to the website with 400,000 people clicking to calculate their carbon footprint. One thing individuals can do is look at what industries are in your backyard that you can really fight against, Maria Lopez-Nunez, deputy director of the Ironbound Community Corporation, a New Jersey-based nonprofit that focuses on climate and environmental justice, told CNN. Lopez-Nunezs organization has engaged with policymakers on pollution issues stemming from a local trash incinerator. The Covanta Essex incinerator in Newark burns nearly 985,000 tons of trash each year, according to the company. Incinerators, which were created due to limited space in landfills, emit greenhouse gas and can aerosolize other hazardous pollutants such as mercury and lead. Lopez-Nunez says if you want to take meaningful action on the climate crisis, do some homework on the groups active in your area. Find frontline organizations that are in neighborhood, not just the big organizations, said Lopez-Nunez. When you dont know whats going on, go find the people that know the issues of your neighborhood, of your cities, of your state.",10/08/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/10/business/what-can-you-do-about-climate-change/index.html
Climate scientists have done their bit. Now the pressure is on leaders for COP26.,"Scientists have warned for decades that we were changing the climate in a way that would have devastating impacts on the planet and our lives. A landmark report on Monday showed thats already happening, and faster than we expected. The findings, by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), serve as a stern wake-up call for politicians, business leaders and policy makers, who in just 12 weeks will meet for the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow to address the biggest existential challenge in human history. For decades, global policy has lagged behind the science, but leaders and big business are now being forced to play catch-up as their constituents and clients battle heat waves, wildfires and floods that are proving costly and deadly. Youve got the politicians being squeezed by the science, which is confirming a sense of alarm and fear, youve got the science now in the public mind, said Tom Burke, co-founder of E3G, a European climate think tank. Youve got capital markets saying this is beginning to really threaten the future value of our investments. So youve got enormous pressure building up on the politicians. Amid the growing pressure, climate-minded policymakers are likely to face hurdles in making Novembers COP26 conference a success, which is often measured by how far the most conservative leaders are willing to go. Recent multilateral meetings on climate between far fewer nations have ended with disappointing results, sometimes even in division. Alok Sharma  President of COP26  has said he wants the conference to reach agreement on a number of key targets, including putting an end date on the use of coal, a commitment to make all new car sales zero emissions within the next 14 to 19 years, stopping deforestation by the end of the decade and greater reductions of methane emissions. But his main message is to keep 1.5 alive. Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, more than 190 countries signed on to limiting the increase in global temperatures to well below 2 degrees Celsius, but preferably 1.5 degrees, a beyond which scientists say the world will experience more intense and frequent climate extremes. But the G7 leaders meeting in June and a G20 ministers meeting last month left some on the global stage disappointed and unsure of what can be accomplished in November. The G20 communique was delivered more than a day later than expected, as some countries opposed language on the issues of when to phase out coal and around the commitment to 1.5 degrees, according to Roberto Cingolani, Italys ecological transition minister, who chaired the meeting. Cingolani told reporters after the conference India and China were holding out on the issue of coal. A source familiar with the talks at the time told CNN that the significant resistance was coming from fossil fuel producing countries, including some developing economies. At a press conference on Monday, Sharma denied that the 1.5-degree threshold was still divisive, and pointed to the communique G20 ministers ultimately agreed to, in which counties said they would continue efforts to limit it to 1.5 above pre-industrial levels. Based on all the conversations that Ive had, I can tell you that there is a clear desire amongst governments to keep that 1.5 degrees within reach, Sharma said. Yet Chinas top climate negotiator Xie Zhenhua last week accused some countries of trying to shift the goal posts from 2 degrees, which countries agreed to in the Paris Accord, to 1.5 degrees. Some countries are pushing to rewrite the Paris Agreement, Xie said, according to the AFP news agency. That is, they want to strive to change the target of control for the rise of temperature from two degrees Celsius to 1.5 degrees Celsius. He added, We have to understand the different situations in different countries, and strive to reach a consensus. And while the G20 ministers eventually agreed to language around 1.5 degrees, some did so begrudgingly. India published its own statement alongside the communique defending developing nations need to grow, urging richer countries to bring their emissions down faster. The G7 and G20 often try to show leadership in global policy areas  together, they represent represent 80% of the worlds emissions and around 85% of the global economy. But the G20 meeting also failed to reach a concrete agreement on coal phaseout and the scrapping of fossil fuel subsidies. Only 13 members of the G20 have committed to net zero, Sharma pointed out Monday, and only eight have submitted new pledges that go beyond their previous ones. All signatories to the Paris Agreement were supposed to submit a second, more ambitious pledge by July this year. Sharma said the failure to reach an agreement on coal was disappointing and admitted that securing one ahead of the COP26 conference will be tricky. He wants the worlds richest countries to scrap coal by 2030 and the rest of the world by 2040. Coal will be on the docket again at the next G20, which comes just before the COP26 summit. Another sticking point for developing nations is that they havent received the money they were promised to adapt to climate change. The developed world in 2009 agreed to transfer $100 billion every year to the developing world by 2020. That commitment was reaffirmed in the 2015 Paris Agreement but the goal was never met. Old divisions and distrust have resurfaced as a result. A net zero economy powered on renewable energy involves overhauling infrastructure, employing new technologies, transitioning to electric vehicles and rethinking jobs and entire industries. Developing nations argue that many of the worlds richest countries became wealthy because they were free to exploit the very fossil fuels they now want the rest of the world to phase out. Withholding promised funds could mean that some countries are less likely budge on on scrapping coal and committing to 1.5 degrees. Already at 1.1 degrees above pre-industrial levels, the world is heading for average global temperatures of 1.5 degrees faster than scientists thought, the IPCC report said. That threshold will likely be crossed in the mid-2030s, even if greenhouse gas is reduced sharply starting today. The good news is we can keep it to 1.5 and avoid hitting 2 degrees, after which the impacts of climate change will become even more severe, according to the report. The key thing to focus on is that every degree of warming, that every tenth of a degree of warming, matters, Tamsin Edwards, a climate scientist at Kings College London and one of the authors of the new IPCC report, told CNN. Its getting harder and harder every year to limit warming to 1.5 degrees because it means we have to cut emissions faster to get to net zero. The reductions in emissions have to be immediate, rapid and large scale, she added. If by the 2050s the world achieves net zero  where the net addition and removal of greenhouse gas is zero  it can contain temperature rises to 1.5 degrees. The other good news is that the science shows that climate systems would respond well to carbon removal. Planting more trees, expanding carbon sinks and possibly using technology that still being developed will limit the warming and its catastrophic consequences. But so much has already been lost. Many of the effects of climate change are now baked in and impossible to reverse in the short term, like ice sheet and glacier melt that will cause sea level rises. The question now is whether leaders will meet the moment and prevent the level of warming that will lead to catastrophe. Its also a question of whether politicians will learn from mistakes of the past. Youve been telling us for over three decades of the dangers of allowing the planet to warm, UN Environment Program Executive Director Inger Andersen said to scientists Monday, after the IPCC report launched. The world listened, but it didnt hear. The world listened, but it didnt act strongly enough. As a result, climate change is a problem that is here, now. Nobodys safe, and its getting worse faster.",10/08/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/10/world/climate-ipcc-report-cop26-politics-cmd-intl/index.html
Scientists say this invisible gas could seal our fate on climate change,"Slashing carbon dioxide emissions is critical to ending the climate crisis. But, for the first time, the UN climate change report emphasized the need to control a more insidious culprit: methane, an invisible, odorless gas with more than 80 times more warming power in the near-term than carbon dioxide. According to the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the concentration of methane in the atmosphere is higher now than any time in at least 800,000 years. With Earth rapidly approaching the 1.5-degree-Celsius threshold above preindustrial levels, scientists say methane emissions need to be reduced fast. Charles Koven, a lead author of the IPCC report, said this is due to methanes incredible warming power. The fastest way that we might mitigate some of the climate change that were seeing already in the short term is by reducing methane, Koven told CNN. If we were to reduce methane emissions, it would act to offset one of these sources of warming. If the world stopped emitting carbon dioxide tomorrow, Koven said, global temperatures wouldnt begin to cool for many years because of how long the gas stays in the atmosphere. Reducing methane is the easiest knob to turn to change the path of global temperature in the next 10 years, he said. Methane, the main component of the natural gas we use to fuel our stoves and heat our homes, can be produced in nature by belching volcanoes and decomposing plant matter. But it is also pumped into the atmosphere in much larger amounts by landfills, livestock and the oil and gas industry. Natural gas has been hailed as a bridge fuel that would transition the US to renewable energy because it is more efficient than coal and emits less carbon dioxide when burned. Importantly for industry, natural gas is in abundant supply around the world and is less costly to extract from the ground. But proponents for this new cleaner gas missed a dangerous threat: that it could leak, unburned, into the atmosphere and cause significant warming. Methane can leak from oil and natural gas wells, natural gas pipelines and the processing equipment itself. According to data from the US Energy Information Administration, the US has thousands of active wells for natural gas, millions of abandoned oil and gas wells, about two million miles of natural gas pipelines, and several refineries that process the gas. One in three Americans lives in a county with oil and gas operations, posing climate and public health risks, according to a report by the Environmental Defense Fund. Until recently, tracking the location and magnitude of methane leaks was difficult. Now, infrared cameras and advanced satellites can estimate methane emissions around the globe, giving scientists and regulators insight into whats being released from facilities. Climatologists at NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration previously told CNN that pernicious changes in the climate system will only intensify unless people stop using fuels that burn and leak greenhouse gases like methane. For carbon dioxide, weve always known about power plants and smokestacks and things like that; but with methane, until recent years, we didnt understand how much an influence a small number of large sources have really had, Robert Jackson, professor of environmental science at Stanford University, told CNN. We didnt understand how long the tail was and how important the super-emitters were for reducing emissions. The latest IPCC assessment highlights that scientists now have a better understanding of how much methane is being released by human activity like agriculture and the fossil fuel industry, and how much it contributes to the climate crisis. The sources of methane emissions vary by region. In North America, a majority  41% of total methane emissions  come from the oil and gas production followed by livestock at 28%. In China, coal mining is the biggest methane driver, contributing 43% to its total emissions. Though agriculture is a major source of methane, Jackson said the emissions from farming and food production would be harder to tackle. There are only certain things we can do with cattle, Jackson said. We can either ask people to stop eating beef or we can try and give cattle feed additives to change the microbes in the chemistry of their guts. But thats not easy to do for billions of cattle around the world. The International Energy Agency estimate that the oil and gas industry around the world can reduce methane by 75% using the technology already available. It also estimates that 40% of the emissions could be reduced without extra costs, since the natural gas captured could then be sold. Climate activists like Lisa DeVille, a member of the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation, are urging policymakers to make stringent methane reductions. The Bakken oil field in North Dakota surrounds the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation, where DeVille lives, with nearly 1,000 oil and gas wells that scientists found in 2016 was leaking 275,000 tons of methane per year. This means the land that is part of my identity as an Indigenous woman has been turned into a pollution-filled industrial zone, DeVille said. This is unacceptable. As the co-founder of the grassroots group Fort Berthold Protectors of Water and Earth Rights, DeVille is tackling environmental regulations head-on. In 2018, the organization successfully sued the Trump administrations Bureau of Land Management for rolling back a critical methane waste prevention rule. Global temperatures are now at 1.1 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, according to the report, and the planet is already seeing the impact in the form of extreme fire behavior, severe flooding, relentless drought and deadly heat waves. The IPCC report makes clear that stopping methane emissions is key to slowing the planet from reaching 1.5 degrees. Scientists say world leaders need to act immediately in tackling all greenhouse gas emissions, and not just carbon dioxide. Rick Duke, senior director and White House liaison for John Kerry, President Bidens special climate envoy, told CNN in a press call that reducing methane, and methane leaks, is a top priority for the Biden administration. Theres been incredible largely behind-the-scenes effort already to prepare to move faster and more comprehensively to cut methane domestically, at the same time that were addressing this as a diplomatic imperative, Duke said. Already, pressure is mounting. In June, DeVille discussed tribal issues, particularly slashing methane emissions and transitioning to clean energy quickly and equitably, with Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan. What we do in the next few years will determine what kind of world we have, what kind of world we leave for our children, said DeVille, who is now seeking to meet with Interior Secretary Deb Haaland to discuss similar issues. We must rapidly switch to clean energy, stop fossil fuel carbon pollution, and then methane leaks.",11/08/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/11/us/methane-climate-change/index.html
Frightening new climate report also holds the seeds of hope,"The latest report has just arrived from more than 200 of the worlds most influential climate scientists, and it isnt pretty. This new assessment from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change makes clear we are on course to blow through the 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming described in its landmark 2018 report. But in a year defined by searing heat waves, torrential floods and raging fires, it is encouraging that this same report also suggests a strategy to alleviate some of its most devastating projections. For the first time in IPCC history, the assessment dedicates an entire chapter to short-lived climate pollutants, casting a spotlight on methane  the reduction of which would have immediate climate benefits. It shows that methane pollution from fossil fuel operations, agriculture and other activities is responsible for more than a quarter of todays warming. The good news is cutting this pollution also represents the fastest way to slow the rate of warming. We know how to cut methane pollution quickly and cheaply, allowing us to make crucial progress while we continue to decarbonize our energy systems. This spring, a team of scientists from Princeton, Duke, Penn State and Texas A&M Universities and the Environmental Defense Fund published groundbreaking research showing that a rapid, full-scale effort to reduce methane pollution could slow the worldwide warming rate by as much as 30%. By fully deploying known solutions, they estimate we could cut emissions in half by 2030, preventing a half a degree of warming by midcentury, and nearly 1 degree Fahrenheit by 2100. One degree would make all the difference in a world grappling to meet the target in the Paris Climate Agreement. More importantly, it would reduce the threat to millions of people globally from climate change impacts such as rising seas, water scarcity and more intense storms. Progress on methane has already begun, but we need to move much faster and with greater ambition. Cutting methane pollution from the oil and gas sector offers the most immediate and affordable potential impact. On his first day in office, President Joe Biden pledged to restore and expand methane standards for the oil and gas industry that were revoked by his predecessor. In June, Congress cleared the way by formally repealing the Trump reversal. The Environmental Protection Agency is expected to propose stronger standards in September that would include tens of thousands of existing facilities excluded under the old policy. Next, the administration should reengage with Canada and Mexico around our 2016 agreement to cut oil and gas methane pollution 40-45% by 2025, and raise that bar to 75% by 2030. These goals should be the baseline for further action, both domestic and international. Likewise, the European Union is contemplating a methane standard for natural gas encompassing the imports that supply 85% of the continents demand. This would have a huge influence on global gas exporters (of which the United States is among the largest). These policies add to the pressure oil and gas companies face from investors and customers alike. Last fall, for example, one of Europes largest gas utilities canceled a $7 billion deal to buy liquid natural gas from Texas over concerns about methane and other pollution. Thats a wake-up call. More than 70 companies have joined the Oil & Gas Methane Partnership, which provides a rigorous and transparent framework for reporting emissions. Thats a major step. Their stated goal is to reduce methane pollution 45% by 2025, and 60-75% by 2030, but its strictly voluntary. One of the main things industry can do to control their emissions is to regularly monitor their facilities and pipelines for leaks and then quickly move to repair or fix any malfunctions or issues. This in turn saves money, minimizes waste and keeps otherwise lost product (natural gas) under control while reducing harmful pollution. EDF released a report this year about how emissions mitigation can even create jobs in the United States. Whats essential now is accountability, for both regulators and industry. Without regular, reliable measurement, its all just promises. Fortunately, the technology for tracking methane pollution has never been better, from hand-held monitors to sensors on aircraft and drones. But the real game-changer is a new generation of satellites designed to locate and quantify methane pollution from orbit. One of these is MethaneSAT, being built by a new arm of Environmental Defense Fund. The most advanced instrument of its kind, it will quantify total methane pollution with unprecedented precision, measuring methane that other satellites cant detect. Data will be publicly available at no cost, enabling stakeholders to compare reductions across companies and countries alike. Sadly, a serious amount of warming is now unavoidable. But every fraction of a degree we can avoid makes a critical difference. We can still get the planet on a much less damaging trajectory. Tackling methane pollution must go hand in hand with the essential task of cutting carbon dioxide pollution. It is a critical opportunity that we cannot afford to miss.",11/08/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/10/opinions/frightening-climate-change-report-fred-krupp/index.html
"As the climate crisis worsens in the US, pressure for action from Biden and Kerry grows","In a summer of deadly and life-altering extreme weather, the Biden administration and Democrats are walking a tightrope, with a razor-thin majority in Congress, to enact policies that will reroute the US economy away from fossil fuels and show the world that the US will lead on climate change. Many of President Joe Bidens climate provisions were either whittled down or stripped out of a $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill the Senate passed on Tuesday, at the same time Bidens climate envoy, John Kerry, is trying to secure climate commitments from other nations in preparation for a major UN conference in November. Global leaders will meet in Glasgow, Scotland, to commit to reducing greenhouse gas emissions  but officials say the success of the summit will hinge on what can be achieved in Washington. Democratic lawmakers note that most of the work has yet to be done, and much of it falls to Congress. I give [the administration] generally very good marks, but with the huge caveat that most of the heavy lifting is still ahead of us, Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island told CNN. Glasgow is still ahead of us, reconciliation is still ahead of us, most of their regulatory work is still ahead of us. The timeline is consequential for Kerrys work; four years of inaction from the Trump administration made other nations skeptical that the US can keep its word on climate. White House officials say the US must show major progress on Bidens decarbonization goals at Glasgow to regain its international credibility. The last, best hope for legislative action on climate now falls to a $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation bill, which Congress will start work on later this month. The bipartisan [infrastructure] bill, their actions on climate are  inadequate isnt even the word, Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York told CNN. Theyre just kind of gestures, but theyre not real, substantive progress. What happens in this reconciliation bill on climate is going to make up an enormous portion of what is possible, definitely legislatively possible, in this first term of Bidens presidency. In around seven months in office, Biden has appointed a domestic climate czar, Gina McCarthy, canceled the Keystone pipeline permit, greenlit several offshore wind projects that languished under the Trump administration and rolled out executive orders aimed at increasing US electric vehicle sales. After reentering the US in the Paris climate accord in January, he laid out an aggressive target to attempt to stabilize a rapidly warming climate: cutting US greenhouse gas emissions by 50 to 52% relative to 2005 levels by 2030. Democratic leaders in the Senate say they want the reconciliation bill to include measures that support Bidens climate ambition, including robust tax credits for clean energy like wind and solar, fees for big polluters, a Clean Electricity Standard and a Civilian Climate Corps. Climate advocates have cheered some of Bidens decisions and criticized others, and they are waiting to see the follow-through. The way to talk about the Biden administration and climate is two very stark truths, Evan Weber, the political director for youth climate group Sunrise Movement, told CNN. He has done very little and hasnt even [signed] any major legislation, yet hes already done more than any president when it comes to tackling the climate crisis. A senior administration official said the Presidents strategy has been first and foremost about getting America back on track when it comes to climate and demonstrating to the world that we are serious about this in a bipartisan way. The need to act on climate was underscored Monday by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which reported fossil fuel emissions are warming the planet much faster than expected, causing already irreversible impacts. The report lays out why fossil fuel emissions need to be cut quickly to keep global temperatures around 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Its now crystal clear that the decisions we make this year are going to decide whether theres a livable planet for my kids, Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut told CNN. Meanwhile, the US is already learning what life at just 1.1 degrees is like. Unprecedented drought in the West has triggered a water crisis. A historic heat wave in the Northwest killed hundreds in late June and obliterated state records. Nearly 40,000 wildfires have scorched 3.5 million acres, including Californias Dixie Fire, which has grown to the second-largest in state history. And in northern Minnesota, when Red Lake Nation tribal secretary Sam Strong looked out his window earlier this summer, smoke from fires in British Columbia blocked out the sun. It almost seems like an Armageddon type of situation, Strong told CNN. My kids cant even go outside, theres so much smoke. Its crazy; we cant live like this. As Americans endure the increasingly dire consequences of the climate crisis, the White House and Congress are staring down a list of monumental tasks. With the Senate divided 50-50 and no room for error, congressional Democrats are starting to draft a $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation bill, which they hope will contain most of their climate provisions. Work on budget reconciliation is likely to take up most of September and part of October, leading up to Glasgow, where Kerry must convince skeptical countries that the US will lead on climate after four years of inaction under the Trump administration. The envoys work has largely been of quiet diplomacy with other countries, and much of his success is dependent on how far Congress will go on climate change. Does the future of the world ride on what happens in the next few months? Maybe, Murphy said. I dont think you can overstate how important it is for us to right the ship on US climate policy, because the [countries] we need to listen to us are not going to unless we show were willing to change our own policy. Since taking office, Kerry has traveled to more than a dozen cities in Europe, Asia and the Middle East to rally allies and partners ahead of Glasgow, otherwise known as COP26. In public remarks, Kerry has outlined his diplomatic efforts in broad strokes  urging countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming to 1.5 degrees. A State Department spokesperson said Kerrys efforts have largely been focused on raising global ambition on climate since no country can solve climate change alone. It is less clear what Kerry has proposed to individual foreign leaders in exchange for greater climate commitments. But it is a mixture of sticks and carrots, according to one of Kerrys senior advisers, Jonathan Pershing. Part of what we have to do is we have to wield the stick, but we also have to have the carrot, he told lawmakers last month. The carrot might be in the way we can offer [countries] an alternative model of growth and development. Although Kerrys climate-envoy portfolio is much smaller than as secretary of state under President Barack Obama, his relationships with foreign leaders run deep and he remains at the intersection of the administrations key foreign-policy and national security priorities. That can sometimes complicate his assignment: In Moscow last month, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov asked Kerry whether sanctions relief might be on the table for Russia, an issue outside of Kerrys remit. Kerry suggested to Lavrov that he would ensure others in the US government were tracking concerns related to sanctions, a State Department spokesperson said. The pair also discussed cybersecurity issues, Kerry told NPR later. Lawmakers say Kerry has had to tread delicately. Getting buy-in from Russia and China, two of the worlds largest greenhouse gas emitters, will be key to his success. From my perspective, the shift to clean energy and climate-resilient development must be a collaborative ongoing process that involves our allies, but also the government of China, Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts, who chairs the Senate Climate Change Task Force, told CNN. Thats the message Secretary Kerry is sending. We cant solve this problem if China is not partnering with us and the rest of the world. One of the sticks at Kerrys disposal could be a warning to countries like China that if they do not move toward cleaner energy they might be subjected to a tax on carbon-intensive imports, known as a border carbon tax. The senior administration official acknowledged such a step was being studied and is a possible tool in the toolbox, but cautioned that it has a long way to go before it can or will be implemented. US officials and climate experts alike say Kerry needs to demonstrate at COP26 that the US has renewed credibility, which will ultimately be determined by what comes out of Washington in the coming months. Asserting it is one thing, but having real accomplishments and having enacted policy is going to be what persuades the rest of the world that America is back, said Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii.",14/08/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/14/politics/biden-kerry-climate-change/index.html
How the climate crisis is changing hurricanes,"In the same week that Tropical Storm Fred caused catastrophic flooding in North Carolina, and Hurricane Grace made its second landfall in Mexico, Hurricane Henri is barreling toward New England, where its expected to be the first to make landfall there in 30 years. Hurricanes  also called tropical cyclones or typhoons outside North America  are enormous heat engines of wind and rain that feed on warm ocean water and moist air. And scientists say the climate crisis is making them more potent. The proportion of high-intensity hurricanes has increased due to warmer global temperatures, according to a UN climate report released earlier this month. Scientists have also found that the storms are more likely to stall and lead to devastating rainfall and they last longer after making landfall. We have good confidence that greenhouse warming increases the maximum wind intensity that tropical cyclones can achieve, Jim Kossin, senior scientist with the Climate Service, an organization that provides climate risk modeling and analytics to governments and businesses, told CNN. This, in turn, allows for the strongest hurricanes  which are the ones that create the most risk by far  to become even stronger. Scientists like Kossin have observed that, globally, a larger percentage of storms are reaching the highest categories  3, 4 and 5  in recent decades, a trend thats expected to continue as global average temperature increases. They are also shifting closer to the poles, moving more slowly across land, growing wetter, and stalling in one location, Kossin found. Theres evidence that tropical cyclones are more likely to stall, said Kossin, naming hurricanes Harvey, in 2017, Florence, in 2018, and Dorian, in 2019, as examples. Hurricane Harvey dumped more than 60 inches of rain on some parts of Texas, causing about $125 billion in damages, according to the National Hurricane Center, and killing more than 100 people. All of these were devastating to the places where they stalled, he added. The combination of slower movement and more rain falling out of them increases coastal and inland flooding risk tremendously. A 2020 study published in the journal Nature also found storms are moving farther inland than they did five decades ago. Hurricanes, which are fueled by warm ocean water, typically weaken after moving over land, but in recent years they have been raging longer after landfall. The study concludes that warmer sea surface temperatures are leading to a slower decay by increasing moisture that a hurricane carries. And as storms like Henri makes landfall, torrential rain, damaging winds and storm surge become the most significant, often pernicious, threats. Storm surge, produced by wind blowing ocean water onshore is also expected to get worse over time due to stronger hurricane winds and climate change-fueled sea level rise, according to Kerry Emanuel, a professor of atmospheric science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Its a very dangerous phenomenon, he said. And its responsible for a lot of the loss of life in the storms. For every fraction of a degree the planet warms, according to the UN report, rainfall rates from high-intensity storms will increase, as warmer air can hold more moisture. Earlier this week, what had been Tropical Storm Fred dumped more than 10 inches of rain on western North Carolina, according to the National Weather Service, which pushed the Pigeon River near Canton 9 feet above flood stage and killed at least four people. The science behind climate change attribution, which attempts to determine how much of a role it played in extreme weather, has made significant advances in the past decade, according to the UN climate report. Heat waves, flooding, drought and higher coastal storm surge are things that scientists are more confident now in linking to climate change. But there are still some questions around hurricane development that need answers, according to Emanuel. Knowing where they develop and where they move is critical to understanding the threat, Emanuel said. So we have to take into account changing tracks, changing intensity, changing frequency, and changing genesis  and were confident about some of them and were not so confident about other elements. Although its hard for scientists to tell whether odd storm tracks in the North Atlantic, like Henris, are becoming more frequent because of climate change, long-term changes along the coast in the Northeast will ultimately influence the storms that do make landfall there. One thing that we might be able to speculate on is that the very unusually warm ocean along the US Northeast coast and Canada has a likely human fingerprint on it, Kossin added. These warm waters should allow Henri to maintain greater intensity as it moves northward. Bob, in 1991, was the last hurricane that made landfall in the New England region. However, Irene, in 2011, and Sandy, in 2012, were destructive for the Northeast when they came ashore, even though they did not make landfall as hurricanes. The 2020 hurricane season tore through the alphabet so quickly that it was forced to use Greek letters as names from September through November. This years season is already above average: Atlantic storms beginning with the letter H typically occur toward the end of September, meaning Henri formed more than a month ahead of average. As the planet rapidly warms, extreme weather events will become more disastrous and possibly harder to predict. Unless climate and emergency management policies are fixed, Emanuel says infrastructure damage and potential loss of life will increase. The forecasters nightmare is going to bed with a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico, headed toward a populated area, and waking up with a Category 4, Emanuel said. And as the climate warms, that becomes more and more likely.",21/08/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/21/weather/hurricane-henri-climate-change/index.html
How climate change amplifies extreme weather like Tennessee? deadly floods and NYC? record rainfall,"In New York, downpours from Hurricane Henri set rainfall records this weekend. At the same time in Tennessee, an astonishing amount of rain led to flash flooding that killed at least 21 people. Though separated by nearly 1,000 miles, these two extreme weather incidents are examples of the same phenomenon: human-caused climate change supercharging extreme rainfall events. And these types of extreme rainfall events are likely to become more common, too, as long as the planet continues to get hotter. The reason is based on a physics principle known as the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship, which relates temperature, pressure and water vapor. The principle shows that warmer air can hold more water vapor  about 7% more water vapor per 1 degree Celsius. More water vapor in the atmosphere means more moisture available to fall as rain, which leads to higher rainfall rates. On average, the planet has already warmed more than 1 degree Celsius since pre-industrial times, according to a major UN climate change report published earlier this month. Over land areas there has been even more warming, and particularly in the Eastern US, which has led to a noticeable increase in heavy downpours that lead to flash flooding, according to the most recent National Climate Assessment. This dynamic played out in Tennessee this weekend as more than 17 inches of rain fell in just 24 hours around McEwen and Centerville  a third of the regions typical annual rainfall  which would set a record in the state of Tennessee once made official. Krissy Hurley, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service, told CNN that one of the biggest factors contributing to this amount of rain was that the atmosphere had ample moisture to work with. When meteorologists launched a weather balloon over the weekend to collect data, they found the moisture in the air was at record levels  a recipe for disaster, according to Hurley. The flooding was caused by several storms that developed one after the other over the same area, which took advantage of that moisture and led to extreme rainfall rates. We had a stationary boundary set up over western part of middle Tennessee that provided the perfect set up conditions, said Mark Rose, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. A constant training of [storms] over that one area for several hours right along that boundary. Meanwhile, in New York City on Saturday night, residents saw extreme rainfall rates unmatched in the citys history. Heavy rainbands associated with the leading edge of then-Hurricane Henri resulted in a torrential downpour in New York City. Between 10 and 11 p.m., 1.94 inches of rain fell in Central Park, setting the all-time record there for the largest amount of rain in a single hour, according to the National Weather Service. In total, 4.45 inches of rain fell in the city on Saturday night, also setting a record for the date  the old record of 4.19 inches had stood since 1888. Hurricanes are essentially massive engines of wind and rain that are fueled by warm ocean water and air. Over the last two-plus centuries, human activity  mainly the burning of fossil fuels  has added lots of heat to the oceans and air where hurricanes are spawned. These extreme rainfall rates are becoming more common because of human-caused global warming, scientists say. According to the UNs report on climate change, the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events have increased since the 1950s over most land area. Deadly flash floods have made headlines around the world this summer, including in Western Europe in July. In that incident, several months-worth of rain fell in hours, turning city streets in Belgium and Germany into torrents of water that pushed cars and debris into homes and businesses and killed hundreds of people. Heavy rainfall also caused floods in Central China last month that led to over 300 deaths. Zhengzhou, the provincial capital of 12 million people, was one of the hardest hit areas, with entire neighborhoods submerged and passengers trapped in flooded subway cars.",23/08/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/23/weather/flooding-henri-tn-climate-change/index.html
Climate change is sparking wildfires that are amplifying Covid,"Wildfire whack-a-mole is the new Western reality in the US. As fires were contained this month in Oregon and Utah, new ones have sprung up in California and Nevada, part of a new smoky reality in the West that is driving up the threat of Covid-19 at exactly the wrong time. The new top fire priority is the Caldor Fire east of Sacramento, which is causing noxious air in Reno and threatening Lake Tahoe. Tens of thousands have been evacuated from homes in whats become an annual frightening threat. The air quality near Reno this week is at its worst its ever been  check the air near you at AirNow.gov  and theres growing evidence that noxious smoke from the fires amplifies the severity of Covid outbreaks. Particulate matter. Respiratory virus. Health crisis. Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations have been climbing precipitously in the Reno area over the past several weeks, according to CNNs report. Coronavirus cases in Washoe County on Monday were up 24% compared to the week before, and hospitalizations increased by more than 18%. A study published in the journal Science tied airborne particulate matter from wildfire smoke in 2020 to a surge in Covid-19 cases and deaths in California, Oregon and Washington. Fine particulate matter air pollution can be an additional vehicle for spreading the virus even faster, said Francesca Dominici, a co-author of the study. Considering that we are seeing an increased risk of cases from the Delta [variant] and we already have the wildfires, thats going to be concerning. Smoke in the lungs. Heres more from CNNs Rachel Ramirez: Fine particulate matter, or PM 2.5, is among tiniest yet also the most dangerous pollutants, and its one of the main components of wildfire smoke, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. When inhaled, it can travel deep into lung tissue and enter the bloodstream, and it is linked to a number of health complications: asthma, heart disease, chronic bronchitis, and other respiratory illnesses  all underlying conditions that make people vulnerable to severe outcomes from Covid-19. RELATED: Tracking wildfires in the US Staying inside on the smokiest days. The smoke in Reno triggered a Stage 3 Emergency air quality advisory this week and residents were encouraged to stay inside with doors and windows closed. Where some kids wait for snow days, in parts of sunny California and nearby in Nevada theyre checking the air quality each day for school closures. Renos schools were back in session today after being closed Monday and Tuesday. As of now, 95% of the West is experiencing drought and seven western states are under air quality alerts resulting from 92 active wildfires. Read more here about the data. The threat of fires is expected to run at least through September and wildfire season in Southern California is only just getting started. Its almost always fire season now. The recent experience of Americans on the West Coast is that fire season is a tired concept. As a report on the USDA website argues, fires can now occur for much of the year, with winter snows melting earlier, rains coming later, trees susceptible to beetle infestations and grasses helping fires spread more quickly. The fire threat is changing with the environment, according to USDA, and so communities will have to adapt and the government will have to beef up its fire fighting capabilities outside of summer. RELATED: These 7 states are under air quality alerts as wildfires rage in the West Covid can be controlled by vaccines. Governments are less far along addressing climate change. It underlies the increasing severity of wild fires, according to a landmark UN report out in August, which suggested the earth has warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels and is approaching the 1.5 degrees that countries agreed would be a tipping point. Wildfires are thought to be a major symptom of that change. RELATED: Why wildfires happen: Debunking the myth that arson is to blame more than climate change What will government do about the climate? Democrats in Washington are trying to find a way around a GOP filibuster to pass a massive $3.5 trillion infrastructure bill that, among many other things, aims to slash US greenhouse gas emissions by throwing money at energy companies to increase clean energy production and tax incentives to spur an electric vehicle revolution. That measure passed the House this week, but its path to becoming law is not set in stone. Climate refugees? Maybe not yet. Clearly the government will have to do things in the short term and long term to address the fire threat. Another question is what will people do? Read this story by CNNs Vanessa Yurkevich, who talks to Adriana Nichols, a woman who moved from New York to Los Angeles 17 years ago, but would now like to leave LA. It is profoundly a different wish list. A place where we have [running] water, where we are not ... having bags packed in case fires evacuate us, said Nichols. But the alternatives shes finding all have some element of climate risk. Floods, like those that killed 18 people this week in Tennessee. Hurricanes. Heat. Yurkevich includes data from Redfin that confounds the notion of climate displacement in the US. Counterintuitively, people are moving to places with higher climate risk, Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin told her. And it seems like climate, although its something that people care about, is at the bottom of the list or its not the top priority.",25/08/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/25/politics/what-matters-fires-and-climate/index.html
Climate change be damned. More Americans are moving to high-risk areas,"Seventeen years ago, when Adriana Nichols moved from New York City to Los Angeles, she had a simple wish list: natural light (her New York studio apartment was dark), a yard and quiet neighbors. She managed to check everything off that list  and has spent nearly two decades living in the canyons of LA. But today, as she looks to move again with her husband, her requirements have changed. It is profoundly a different wish list. A place where we have [running] water, where we are not... having bags packed in case fires evacuate us, said Nichols. In the last few years, Nichols says the California wildfires and poor air quality make living there unappealing  and downright scary. But she says nearly everyplace she looks to move to is experiencing some element of climate risk. And a new analysis by Redfin, a real estate brokerage, reveals more Americans are moving into areas that face the highest climate risks than ever before. Redfin analyzed data from ClimateCheck, a real estate climate risk assessment provider, and the US Census, which showed that of the top 50 US counties facing climate risks in heat, storms, drought, flood and fire  the majority saw an increase in population over the last five years. Counties with homes facing the highest heat risk saw populations increase by an average of 4.7% over the last five years. Counties with homes facing high drought risk saw population growth of 3.5%, fire risk counties grew by 3%, flood 1.9%, and storm 0.4% over the last five years. Meanwhile, places with relatively low climate risks have experienced population declines. The 50 counties with the lowest number of homes facing heat risk, for example, saw a population loss of 1.4% in the last five years, according to Redfin. Counties around New York City and Chicago  both in states that were already leading the US in population decline  only lost more people during the pandemic when homebuyers left metro areas in exodus, according to Redfin. Counterintuitively, people are moving to places with higher climate risk, said Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin. And it seems like climate, although its something that people care about, is at the bottom of the list or its not the top priority. For example, migration to Wasatch County, Utah, just outside Salt Lake City, is up almost 15% in the last five years. But Wasatch County has the third-highest fire risk in the US, with 96% of the homes there at risk, according to Redfin. The area became even more popular in the last year amid the pandemic, with people looking for affordability, more space and proximity to the outdoors. 2020 saw some of the worst wildfires weve ever seen in Utah, said Ryan Aycock, agent and market manager for Redfin in Salt Lake City. I dont necessarily believe that its going to slow down the people moving into the area. Its still extremely affordable. Its still a very desirable place to live compared to a lot of places. Affordability appears to be a big factor. Of the 50 counties with the largest share of homes facing high heat and storm risk, more than half had a median sale price below the national average of $315,000, Redfin found. Williamson County, Texas  part of the Austin metro area  has the highest heat risk in the US, yet its the county with the biggest growth in population, at 16.3% since 2016, according to Redfin. People live in San Francisco or New York for the most part because its where they are able to advance their careers the most, but now Austin is starting to rise as a tech hub and Austin has climate risk, said Fairweather. Its also where people are buying their second homes  followed by Florida, where homebuyers are taking advantage of lower taxes, said Scott Durkin, CEO of Douglas Elliman. I think people continue to put [climate risk] in the back of their minds. I think there are people that will do anything to be on the ocean and the coast of Florida and nothing, nothing will deter them, said Durkin. Thats despite a record-breaking Atlantic hurricane season last year. And the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is predicting a 60% chance of an above-normal hurricane season again this year, with Florida often a target. Still, home sales in Palm Beach and Miami, are up 270% and 133%, respectively, since last year, according to Douglas Elliman. During the pandemic-fueled red-hot housing market, many buyers waived home inspections to beat out other buyers, according to Durkin. However, in climate temperate areas, Durkin advises against that. If youve got something that has the elements of the strong weather or... subject to heavy winds and waves breaking and beach erosion, you have to really think twice. You may want to get the inspection on the way in before you even negotiate, just so you know for yourself, said Durkin. As for Nichols, she wants to be out of her Los Angeles home in a matter of months. Its no longer a question of, Where do we want to live? The question has become, Where can we live in relationship to whats happening there climate wise? said Nichols.",25/08/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/25/success/climate-risk-home-buying/index.html
Queen Elizabeth II will attend UN climate change talks in Glasgow,"Britains Queen Elizabeth II will attend a pivotal United Nations climate change conference in Glasgow this fall, organizers said in a tweet Friday, giving a royal boost to the event. The United Kingdom is hosting global leaders for the nearly two weeks of talks in the Scottish city from October 31 to November 12. The talks, known as COP26, will come on the heels of the G20 meeting in Rome and is expected to draw many of the groups leaders to open the negotiations. The Queen attended G7 talks in Cornwall earlier this year, where climate was discussed. The British government, which is organizing the talks, has insisted that COP26 will go ahead despite the challenges of international travel brought by the pandemic. COP26 would be one of the biggest in-person international events since the pandemic began. The event is happening against the backdrop of a series of extreme weather events across the Northern Hemisphere, including heatwaves and wildfires in parts of North America, southern Europe and North Africa, as well as floods in China and Western Europe. It also follows the release of a state-of-the-science report by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which found that global warming has happened more quickly than they previously understood and that the human influence on climate is unequivocal. COP26 President Alok Sharma has set out a loose agenda for the talks, focused on getting leaders to commit to limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels to stave off worsening impacts of the climate crisis. There will also be a focus on putting an end date on the use of coal, and boosting wealthy nations payments to the global south to assist countries as they adapt to the climate crisis and prepare for a net zero future, in which the world will emit no more greenhouse gases than it removes.",27/08/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/27/world/queen-elizabeth-ii-cop26-climate-glasgow-intl/index.html
"Climate change is making hurricanes stronger, slower and wetter. Ida checked all the boxes","Human-caused climate change is making hurricanes more dangerous. They are producing more rainfall, moving slower once they make landfall and generating larger storm surges along the coast. Hurricane Ida was a prime example of those changes, and scientists say storms like this will become more common as the planet warms. Fueled by warmer-than-normal water in the Gulf of Mexico, Hurricane Ida destroyed homes, uprooted trees and cut off power to more than 1 million residents. It battered Mississippi and the already storm-ravaged state of Louisiana, and officials there say they expect the death toll to increase in the coming days. Hurricane Ida was just the latest in back-to-back storms that have slammed Louisiana in recent years. But Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at the Nature Conservancy and professor at Texas Tech University, said an important distinction is not the frequency of the storms but their severity. Weve always had hurricanes, weve always had heat waves, weve always had floods and droughts, but what climate change is doing is loading the weather dice against us, Hayhoe told CNN. Its sneaking in when were not looking, changing the numbers as were rolling and asking what is this, how could this happen? The answer to that is climate change, she said. Hurricanes  also called tropical cyclones or typhoons outside North America  are being made more intense by the warming ocean, which studies have shown has absorbed approximately 90% of the planets excess heat trapped by human-produced greenhouse gas emissions. And a recent study found that the planet is trapping roughly double the amount of heat than it did nearly 15 years ago. As the planet heats up, storms get stronger. The recent state-of-the-science United Nations report on climate change concluded that the global proportion of cyclones ranging from Category 3 to 5  the most intense storms  has increased over the last four decades due to rapidly warming ocean temperatures. For every additional degree of warmth, scientists say not only will the proportion of intense cyclones continue to climb, but extreme rain events are also forecast to intensify by about 7%. We know that, in general, hurricanes are intensifying faster, Hayhoe said. They are bigger and stronger than they would be otherwise; they have a lot more rainfall associated with them, and rising sea level exacerbates storm surge. Before making landfall on Sunday, Hurricane Ida went through a remarkable period of strengthening: its maximum sustained winds increased by 65 mph in just 24 hours. Scientists define rapid intensification  a process that historically has been rare  as an increase of 35 mph in 24 hours or less. Hurricane Ida nearly doubled that definition. For rapid intensification to occur, warm ocean water must extend well below the surface, going hundreds of feet deep, to provide enough engine for the hurricane to strengthen. This has led scientists to believe that storms are more likely to undergo rapid intensification as a result of warmer oceans. If you increase the speed limit, you make more room for the storms to strengthen, so it can intensify more quickly, Jim Kossin, a senior scientist with the Climate Service, an organization that provides climate risk analysis to governments and businesses, told CNN. Ida made landfall in Louisiana as a Category 4, and is now tied in the record books with Laura in 2020 as the strongest hurricane to make landfall there. Storms are also generating more rainfall. For every degree of warming, the atmosphere can hold 7% more water vapor that could fall as rain. After flooding from Hurricane Harvey devastated the Houston area in 2017, scientists found that human-caused climate change supercharged the storms rainfall by approximately 15%. Hurricane Ida has dumped more than 15 inches of rain on parts of Louisiana, according to the National Weather Service. As the remnants of the storm arc from the South to New England, another 3 to 7 inches of rain is expected across at least 12 states, including areas already impacted by severe flooding this month such as Tennessee and New Jersey. Paul Miller, a coastal meteorology scientists at Louisiana State University, said southeast Louisiana, including Baton Rouge and New Orleans, experienced one of its wettest seasons on record. According to Miller, it rained on 91% of the days between June 18 and July 19 at the New Orleans airport, compared to the regions average of 40-50%. Its been a historically wet year in southeast Louisiana even before Ida, he told CNN. This really exacerbated concerns about flooding during Ida because the ground had already absorbed a lot of water this year. Satellite data also shows that storms are getting slower, particularly after they make landfall, according to Hayhoe. Slower and larger storms means they can cover a greater area, idle and dump more rain during that time period. And, while experts say the research is still developing, a 2020 study published in the journal Nature found storms are staying stronger farther inland than they did five decades ago. Since hurricanes are fueled by warm ocean water, they tend to weaken over land, but in recent years they have been raging longer after landfall. The study concludes that warmer sea surface temperatures are leading to a slower decay by increasing the amount of moisture that a hurricane can carry. Storm surge, the flooding that occurs when hurricane winds push ocean water over land, is also getting worse due to sea level rise. Hayhoe said storm surge can inundate a larger area now than it would from a hurricane of the same intensity about 50 or 100 years ago. As the water piles up along the coast, rivers and streams that drain into the ocean can also be blocked, forcing water levels to rise upstream. Storm surge and strong winds from Hurricane Ida reversed the flow of the Mississippi River near New Orleans on Sunday  something the US Geological Survey says is extremely uncommon. Scott Perrien, a hydrologist with the USGS, told CNN that the rivers level on Sunday rose about 7 feet due to storm surge at the gauge located in Belle Chasse, about 20 miles south of New Orleans. At the same time, the rivers flow slowed from about 2 feet per second down to about half a foot per second in the other direction, Perrien said. I remember, off hand, that there was some flow reversal of the Mississippi River during Hurricane Katrina, Perrien said, but it is extremely uncommon. Tom Knutson, senior scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said combined with wind and rain, storm surge is one of the more dangerous aspects of hurricanes. Nearly half of all deaths from tropical cyclones come from storm surge. Louisianas natural buffer against storm surge  its coastal wetlands  are also disappearing due to sea level rise and persistent severe hurricanes. Watching each additional hurricane, like Ida, hit the state, is a reminder of the importance of preserving and restoring these environments, Miller said. As the ocean gets warmer due to fossil fuel emissions, the Gulf Coast will likely experience more hurricanes that are as severe as Ida. Hayhoe said the only choice humans have left is to either rapidly cut greenhouse gas emissions or face the most catastrophic impacts of the climate crisis. The bottom line is climate change is not only an environmental issue or a coastal issue, climate change is an everything issue  a human issue, Hayhoe said. To care about climate impacts and to advocate for climate action, we only have to be one thing, and that one thing is a human living on planet Earth.",30/08/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/30/weather/hurricane-ida-climate-change-factors/index.html
These ancient climate change events helped early humans migrate across the Arabian desert,"Stone tools and ancient animal fossils have revealed that early humans were in Arabia 400,000 years ago. Prehistoric climate change may have encouraged their travels across what are now vast stretches of desert, according to new research. This is the oldest dated evidence for humans in Arabia, which includes Saudi Arabia and other countries across the Arabian Peninsula. Saudi Arabias deserts are some of the driest regions in the world, but it was a different story hundreds of thousands of years ago. Environmental changes occurred after periods of heavy rainfall in the desert, creating lush grasslands that served as the perfect backdrop for early human ancestors migrating to and from Africa. In the hollows between large dunes, researchers found evidence of ancient lake formation at the Khall Amayshan 4 archeological site and Jubbah Oasis in the Nefud desert, located in northern Saudi Arabia. Between 400,000 and 55,000 years ago, these periodical lakes formed and filled at five different times that were associated with the discovery of stone tools. The stone tools help document how these early human cultures and their materials shifted over time. The oldest tools belong to cultures that relied on handaxes, like early human ancestors Homo erectus and Homo heidelbergensis. This transitions to more developed stone tool technology that could have belonged to early Homo sapiens and Neanderthals. The research is a breakthrough in Arabian archaeology, according to lead study author Huw Groucutt, head of the Max Planck Extreme Events Research Group in Jena, Germany, based at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology. Arabia has long been seen as an empty place throughout the past, Groucutt said. Our work shows that we still know so little about human evolution in vast areas of the world and highlights the fact that many surprises are still out there. Hollows between sand dunes in the Nefud desert would catch and pool water during pulses of heavy rainfall thousands of years ago, creating small lakes, wetlands and rivers bordered by grasslands. This environment supported the migration of both animals and early human ancestors. The Arabian Peninsula in Southwest Asia is the only land bridge that connected Africa to Eurasia. While this area has been of interest to researchers, the deep arid interior of the peninsula isnt easy to access. In order to penetrate deep into the desert we have to have jeeps and enough supplies to conduct our surveys and excavations, and occasionally we have to employ the use of a helicopter to get to the archaeological sites in the interior of the deserts, said study coauthor Michael Petraglia, project leader and professor at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, via email. Satellite imagery allowed the researchers to see there were once about 10,000 ancient lakes across Arabia, and surveying the archaeological sites revealed stone tools and animal fossils. Massive wild cattle, ostriches, gazelles and even hippos lived along the shores of lakes and were surrounded by grasslands and savannahs. The presence of hippos is extraordinary, as that tells us that there were enough rivers, lakes and wetlands to sustain them, Petraglia said. These Green Arabia events drew in animals and the hominins that were pursuing them, he said. However, green events were not long-lasting, as they were followed by decreased rainfall and the formation of deserts. We do not know what happened to hominins during these arid periods, but we suspect that they either moved on or went extinct. The findings have suggested that human migrations trekked through the heart of Arabia, rather than taking coastal routes as suggested by previous research. The stone tools recovered also shed light on the people who made them, even if their remains can no longer be found in the desert. And these tools tell a diverse story of cultures coming together on migration routes. Arabia is the staging ground for migrations between Africa and Asia, Petraglia said. It is the geographic bridge between continents that has been ignored by scientists for decades. It is clearly a key region for the migrations of multiple hominin (early human ancestor) species over time, likely coming from different directions including Northern Africa, the Levant and possibly other parts of Asia. Its possible that Arabia also served as a place for different species of humans to interact. Some of the tools dated to 55,000 years ago are similar to those made by Neanderthals, which would make this the southernmost discovery of Neanderthals so far. Arabia may be one of the most important places for understanding where humans mixed and mated, Petraglia said. It is potentially the staging ground for interbreeding among species. We must find human fossils to prove this, and so the search is on. It also serves as a reminder of the profound ways in which environmental change has affected, and continues to affect, the survival of life on our planet, said study coauthor Tom White, a senior curator of Non-Insect Invertebrates at the Natural History Museum in London, in a statement. Now, the researchers want to fill in the remaining gaps in the history of how ancient humans eventually migrated across the globe. We know that archaic humans made it to China by 2.1 million years ago, Petraglia said. This means that we are missing an archaeological record in Arabia, and there is a current gap of more than 1.5 million years. This question could be answered by the oldest sites in Arabia  scientists just have to identify them first.",01/09/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/01/world/early-humans-arabia-migration-scn/index.html
Ida turns New York City into a front line of extreme weather supercharged by climate change,"After Hurricane Ida battered the southern US states, its remnants lashed the northeast on Wednesday night, transforming New York City into a danger zone Thursday morning. Ida dumped heavy amounts of rain on Central Park and the subway was inundated with fast-moving floods, knocking nearly the whole system out of operation. The neighboring city of Newark, New Jersey, saw the heaviest single day of rain on record. These are the kinds of scenes that scientists say the world will see more of because of human-caused climate change. Officials in New York appeared totally caught off guard by the floods. Meteorologists  who knew storms and floods were on their way, even roughly how much rain would fall  were also surprised at the storms pace. Its dangerous. Were seeing a kind of rainfall  we almost never see this kind of speed with which the rain has come, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said, urgently calling on everyone to stay at home. New York Governor Kathy Hochul said she could not guarantee responders could rescue people that may be stuck in their cars if it starts floating away like a boat on a river. Eight people have already died in New York and New Jersey, which are both under a state of emergency. What is so surprising is the time span of the rainfall and the area impacted, said CNN Weathers Michael Guy. It is such a large area across the northeast, and it only happened within a span of a few hours. Thats nothing that we have seen, especially in this region of the country. Like with several weather events over the summer across the Northern Hemisphere, Ida has smashed records in some areas by a huge margin. Wednesday was the rainiest day on record for Newark, New Jersey, which saw 8.41 inches of rain recorded. Thats nearly 25% above the previous record, set in 1977. In New York City, more rain fell in a single hour (3.15 inches) than at any point in the citys weather records, which go back to the 1800s. New Yorks Central Park recorded 7.13 inches of rain, nearly doubling the previous record set in 1927 for the same date, the National Weather Service New York reported. New York Citys flash flood emergency status is the first issued in its history. Globally, extreme rainfall events  including those in Germany and China in recent months  are becoming more common because of human-caused global warming, scientists say. A recent UN climate report said that the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events have increased since the 1950s over most land area. Across continental US, specifically, the heaviest downpours have been observed to be increasing in all regions, with the northeast showing the largest increase, according to the US National Climate Assessment. Warmer air can contain more water vapor than cooler air. Global analyses show that the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere has in fact increased over both land and oceans, the report says. In terms of hurricanes, climate change is making them more dangerous. They are producing more rainfall, moving slower once they make landfall and generating larger storm surges along the coast. Hurricane Ida was a prime example of those changes, and scientists say storms like this will become more common as the planet warms. Scientists are now able to analyze exactly how much of a role climate change is likely to have played in a particular weather event. Its too early to make such an estimate for Ida, but trends in hurricanes of this force suggest a link. What we can say, without doing a dedicated attribution study, is that major hurricane occurrences (categories 3-5) have increased in recent decades, which cannot be explained by natural variability alone, Friederike Otto, who co-leads the World Weather Attribution initiative, told CNN in an email. Specifically, from event attribution, we do note that when hurricanes occur, the rainfall associated with them is more intense because of human-induced climate change, and Ida will not be an exception. While there is less certainty about the impacts of climate change on wind speed and some other factors, there is high confidence that the translation speed  how fast the whole system moves  of hurricanes has slowed, Otto said. This is important as it means the cyclones hang around for longer and thus can also cause more damage. Climatologist Kim Cobb, director of the Global Change Program at the Georgia Institute of Technology, warned that New York, like many cities, was clearly not prepared to deal with climate-related and weather disasters such as Storm Ida. I dont think that what were seeing today is emblematic of a climate-ready city in New York and, obviously, we have a story coming out from cities across the world  from communities out west grappling with wildfires that are linked to climate change, Cobb told CNN. Were just coming out of Idas devastation across the southeast US  Louisiana and Mississippi  infrastructure that is not ready for our climate of now, let alone the climate of tomorrow. These kinds of climate impacts are going to worsen with each additional increment of warming. On an individual level, the US government advises people to find safe shelter immediately in the event of a flood, and to refrain from walking, swimming or driving through flood waters. Authorities in the northeast are urging people to stay off the streets. A landmark climate science report by the UNs Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change published in August, of which Cobb was a lead author, found that global warming was happening faster than scientists had previously thought. The report laid out a robust scientific argument for reaching net zero  where the world emits no more greenhouse gases than it removes  by 2050. That would require deep cuts to greenhouse gas emissions and for the world to wean off unabated fossil fuels. Reaching net zero by 2050 could contain average global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, which scientists say would stave off some of the more catastrophic climate change impacts than the world if currently experiencing. Warming is already at around 1.2 degrees C.",02/09/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/02/world/ida-climate-change-floods-rain-intl/index.html
Is this *finally* the moment we wake up to the climate crisis?,"Record flooding in Philadelphia and New York City. Tornadoes in New Jersey. Fires burning through California and Nevada. Everywhere you look, extreme weather. Weather the likes of which even meteorologists and other experts say they have never seen before. Whats perhaps more remarkable is that we know why all of this is happening: Our changing climate. As the Earth warms, more extreme weather becomes more of the rule rather than its exception. In April, the World Meteorological Organization released a report detailing a five-fold increase in the number of extreme weather events over the past five decades. The WMO, which is part of the United Nations, estimated that those extreme weather events have left more than 2 million people around the globe dead and cost $3.64 trillion in total losses. Because of climate change, unfortunately this is something were going to have to deal with great regularity, New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul said at a news conference Thursday to address the historic flooding in the Empire State. Rep. Cori Bush of Missouri, a prominent liberal voice in Congress, was even more blunt  tweeting: Glaciers started melting and Congress waited. Fires started burning and Congress waited. People started dying and Congress waited. Now our cities are underwater, wildfires are raging, and temperatures are at record highs. Congress can no longer wait to pass a Green New Deal. That politicians like Hochul and Bush were even talking about climate change in the midst of its effects suggests some progress  that at least some politicians have made the connection between the extreme weather we are experiencing and the warming climate. Bushs tweet raises a simple but deeply important question: Is this the moment when we, as a country, start to take climate change seriously? Or is this, like so many other scenes of extreme weather in recent years, simply written off or ignored because the solutions are too politically painful? For a long time, the political reality of climate went something like this: The effects of our warming planet were too far away for any politician  or the average person  to worry about them. Sure, at some point in the long-distant future we, as a society, would need to make some changes in regard to our energy consumption and our broader lifestyle, but it wanst urgent. It was something that, maybe, our kids kids kids would need to worry about. The events of the last few days put the lie to those assumptions. Yes, climate change will continue to worsen unless actions are taken  and quickly. But, we dont have to wait to see the impact of a warming climate. The record flooding in New York is climate change. The massive Caldor Fire is climate change. The rapid intensification of Hurricane Ida leading to yet another major hurricane wrecking Louisiana is climate change. This is all factually true. There is no debate within the scientific community that we are currently living through the first major impacts of the warming planet  and that, unless critical changes are made, and soon, things will get significantly worse. Bottom line is that we have zero years left to avoid dangerous climate change, because its here, said Michael E. Mann, a lead author of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report on climate, which came out in August. Polling is mixed on just how much of that message has gotten through to Americans. In a May 2021 Pew poll, about two-thirds of respondents (64%) said that climate change should be a top priority to ensure a sustainable planet for future generations, even if that means fewer resources for addressing other important problems today. Roughly 1 in 3 (34%) said that climate should be a lower priority, with so many other important problems facing Americans today, even if that means more climate problems for future generations. When it comes to making changes to bring about the changes required to curb our climate crisis, the public is significantly more divided. A slim majority (51%) said that in the next 50 years major lifestyle changes will be necessary to address problems from climate change. Meanwhile, 46% believe that new technology will be developed over the next 50 years that will handle the growing problem of climate change. That disconnect between acknowledging climate change is a problem and grasping the need to make at-times drastic changes in how we live in the world has long been a source of frustration for those focused on the threat posed by the Earths warming. The sad reality is this: It may take extreme events impacting millions and millions of American personally  and costing peoples lives  before the proper urgency about climate change is reached. Is this that moment? For the sake of the people who died amid the flooding and storms, we can hope so.",02/09/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/02/politics/climate-change-tornado-flooding-fires/index.html
More than 230 journals warn 1.5? of global warming could be ?atastrophic?for health,"Human health is already being harmed by the climate crisis, and the impacts could become catastrophic and irreversible unless governments do much more to address global warming, the editors of more than 230 medical journals said in a joint editorial Monday. The editorial points to established links between the climate crisis and a slew of adverse health impacts over the past 20 years: Among them are an increase in heat deaths, dehydration and kidney function loss, skin cancer, tropical infections, mental health issues, pregnancy complications, allergies, and heart and lung disease, and deaths associated with them. Health is already being harmed by global temperature increases and the destruction of the natural world, a state of affairs health professionals have been bringing attention to for decades, the editorial reads. It warned that an increase of global average temperatures of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels and the loss of biodiversity risked catastrophic harm to health that will be impossible to reverse. Governments around the world are laying out plans to try to contain global warming to 1.5C to stave off worsening impacts of climate change, a target that the editorial said did not go far enough to protect public health. Warming is already at around 1.2C. Despite the worlds necessary preoccupation with Covid-19, we cannot wait for the pandemic to pass to rapidly reduce emissions, the authors wrote, calling on governments to respond to the climate crisis with the same spirit of unprecedented funding dedicated to the pandemic. The UK-based BMJ, one of the journals that published the report, said that never before had so many health publications come together to make the same statement, reflecting the severity of the climate change emergency now facing the world. The authors also warned that the aim to reach net zero  where the world emits no more greenhouse gases than it removes from the atmosphere  was relying on unproven technology to take gases like carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. They added it was more likely that global warming would surpass 2C, a threshold that climate scientists say would bring catastrophic extreme weather events, among other impacts to human, animal and plant life. Simply urging the world and energy industry to transition from fossil fuels to renewables falls short of the action needed to meet the challenge of the climate crisis, they said. The editorial was published as a call to action ahead of a several meetings between global leaders to discuss and negotiate action on the climate crisis, including the UN General Assembly next week, a biodiversity conference in Kunming, China, in October and crucial climate talks in the Scottish city of Glasgow in November. Among key climate issues expected to be addressed at these events are the 1.5C target, putting an end date on the use of coal and protecting biodiversity, both on land and sea. The greatest threat to global public health is the continued failure of world leaders to keep the global temperature rise below 1.5C and to restore nature. Urgent, society-wide changes must be made and will lead to a fairer and healthier world, the authors wrote. We, as editors of health journals, call for governments and other leaders to act, marking 2021 as the year that the world finally changes course.",06/09/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/05/health/climate-health-journals-warning-intl/index.html
Majestic sequoia trees can live for thousands of years. Climate change could wipe them out,"Almost everything about a sequoia tree is giant: It can grow to more than 200 feet tall and live longer than 3,000 years. Yet the sequoias footprint is shrinking, as human-induced climate change threatens this ancient trees survival. Sequoias were once found across the Northern Hemisphere, but today, they only naturally grow across the western slopes of the southern Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. So when the Castle Fire broke out in August 2020, and merged with another fire to tear through more than 174,000 acres over four months, the loss was something even experts didnt think possible  somewhere between 7,500 to 10,600 mature giant sequoias were destroyed, according to a report by the National Park Service, published in June. Thats 10-14% of the entire worlds population of mature sequoias  a big chunk of history up in flames. They stood for a couple of thousand years before ancient Rome, before Christ, Clay Jordan, superintendent of Sequoia & Kings Canyon National Parks, told CNN. I mean, these trees were mature. There are only around 48,000 acres of sequoia groves left in the world, and the trees are now facing threats from human-made climate change in several ways. Scientists say that climate change is making wildfires more frequent and intense. Fires in June this year in the Western states would have been virtually impossible without human-made climate change, according to an analysis by more than two dozen scientists at the World Weather Attribution project. The Castle Fire last year was started by lightning, but that doesnt mean climate change wasnt to blame  a severe and extended drought in California had left vegetation extremely dry, turning it all into kindling, allowing fires here to burning hotter and longer. Sam Hodder  president and chief executive officer of Save the Redwoods League, a nonprofit dedicated to protecting coastal redwoods and giant sequoias  explained that the threat is compounded by cedar bark beetles, which thrive in drier conditions. A giant sequoia that was weakened by drought was then subject to impacts by the bark beetle, which then further weakened the tree and made it more susceptible to mortality from fire, he said. Hodder described the Castle Fire as something not witnessed for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. This was the first time that the fire got big and hot enough to get into the crowns of multiple giant sequoia and kill them, he said. Sequoias have survived many a drought before, and even those that were spared from the Castle Fire are showing clear signs of stress. Christy Brigham, Sequoia & Kings Canyon National Parks chief of resource management and science, said the trees were shedding their needles because its too dry. The trees have recovered from previous droughts, Brigham said, but if climate change continues and droughts become more severe, they may not be able to survive. she said. To know what these trees have survived, researchers turn to dendrochronology, the science of studying tree rings, which Clay Jordan refers to as the sequoias journals. Biologists can look at those rings and work out when it might have been affected by fire or periods of drought. They sometimes shed light on how humans have threatened them. We know that, on average, a healthy forest would experience lightning strike fires about every 10 to 20 years and those fires would be low in intensity and would help burn up those excessive fuels  keep the forest at a thin enough level so that the forest could thrive, Jordan said. A raft of suppression measures that authorities have undertaken to reduce forest fires has in some cases made matters worse. Forests naturally need to burn to some degree, just typically at lower intensity than they do now. Those less powerful fires burn off just enough kindling to make forests less susceptible to more intense fires. Now those fires burn hot enough that they can get above the thick barks and into the crowns of these giant sequoias, where they are vulnerable, Jordan said, noting that fires are now burning at much higher intensities than they historically did. When Brigham and her colleagues visited the site of the Castle Fire after it stopped, they discovered a scene of such lifelessness that she described it as a moonscape. There were no seedlings. There were no needles. There were hardly any cones. Everything had been incinerated  the entire canopies. It was a field of the worlds largest burned up toothpicks, she said. A couple of hours away by car stands Alder Creek Grove  roughly 540 acres purchased by Save the Redwoods League at the end of 2019. On the day CNN visited, the sky was smoky and white, as yet another wildfire burned in the region. Among the charred and misshapen trees, some of the once-commanding giant sequoias had been reduced to short and spindly spires. Standing here, weve got at least a dozen dead giant sequoias. These trees were 1,500 to 3,000 years old, said Tim Borden, Save the Redwoods Leagues sequoia restoration and stewardship manager. Their tree mortality rate for these trees annually was less than .01% and so in one year, in 2020, for us to see 10 to 14% of the total of giant sequoias alive killed in one year, in one fire? Theres nothing to compare that to. But patched between the peaks and valleys in the Sierra Nevada mountains, there are little saplings of hope. Down the ridge near where the monarch sequoias  which are the older trees  burned out, in an area where the fire wasnt so intense, a carpet of new life has taken root. Thats because after lower-intensity fires, sequoias can open up their cones and start to germinate, Hodder explained. And there is hope, too, that people will value these trees  and all of the planets biodiversity  enough to influence their governments to take bolder action on the climate crisis behind the sequoias struggles. During CNNs visit to the Sequoia National Park, schoolchildren and families flocked to up the winding road to see the worlds largest tree, by volume. The General Sherman tree is stunning, a glorious monarch sequoia standing more than 275 feet tall and 36 feet wide. Its more than 2,300 years old. Without an urgent response to the climate crisis and an improvement in forest maintenance, this tree, which has lived through the rise and fall of entire civilizations, could be lost in a single fire, like thousands of others in this forest were. Theyre among the most rare, the oldest, the biggest living species in the world, Hodder said. We dont have a moment to lose in getting these forests ready for our new reality.",07/09/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/07/americas/sequoia-trees-climate-california/index.html
Animals are ?hape shifting?in response to climate change,"Some warm-blooded animals are experiencing shifts in their body shapes, likely as a response to the pressures of climate change, according to a new review of existing research. Animals are getting larger beaks, legs and ears that allow them to better regulate their body temperatures as the planet gets hotter, with birds particularly affected, said Sara Ryding, a researcher at Deakin University in Australia and one of the authors of the research that published on Tuesday in the journal Trends in Ecology & Evolution. The biggest shifts in appendage size in the more than 30 animals they looked at in the review were among some Australian parrot species, which saw their beak size increase by 4% to 10% on average since 1871. It means animals are evolving, but it does not necessarily mean that they are coping with climate change. We can see that some species have increased in appendage size so far, but we dont know if they will be able to keep up as the climate crisis worsens, Ryding said via email. We also dont know whether these shape-shifts actually aid in survival (and therefore are beneficial) or not. This phenomenon of shape-shifting shouldnt be seen as a positive, but rather it is alarming that climate change is pushing animals to evolve like this, under such a relatively short timeframe. She said that the changes were subtle and unlikely to be immediately noticeable but could be functionally important. While climate warming was a compelling argument as the driving force behind these changes in shape, the study said that it was difficult to establish causality with confidence given the multifaceted effects climate change has on the environment. Within an animal species, individuals in warmer climates have larger appendages, such as wings and beaks  a pattern known as Allens rule, with the greater surface area allowing the animals to control their temperature more easily, the study noted. At the same time, body sizes tend to shrink, since smaller bodies hold onto less heat. In the United States, a recent study of 70,716 migratory birds representing 52 species showed that they have been getting smaller over the past four decades, and their wingspan wider. The birds all died when hitting high-rise buildings in Chicago during migration and were collected by the citys Field Museum. Both of our studies look at how animals respond to climate change by altering their surface area to volume ratio, explained Ryding. While most research on morphological change over time has focused on birds, the paper noted that shrews and bats have increased their relative ear, tail, leg and wing sizes. It said that more research on different species and in different ecosystems was needed to determine how wide the phenomenon was and could help predict which species might shape-shift in the future. Previous studies have shown cases where shape-shifting is happening, but these have focused on individual species or groups. Our review paper combines all of these to show how widespread this phenomenon seems to be, Ryding said.",07/09/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/07/world/animals-climate-change-shape-shift-scn/index.html
Biden gets real on climate change,"We dont have any more time. Thats Joe Biden, who spent the last few days touring devastation from Hurricane Ida and warning about super storms exacerbated by climate change. Last week, the President went to Louisiana, where thousands of people still lack power after Ida roared ashore  though, thankfully, levees held after being strengthened in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Remarkably, Ida was not at its deadliest on the Gulf Coast, where winds reached 140 mph, but a thousand miles away, when it hit New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut and New York. Flash floods, tornadoes and high winds left at least 50 dead in the Northeast, and in the process laid bare vulnerabilities faced by coastal cities amid global warming. For decades, scientists have warned of extreme weather, it would be more extreme and climate change was here and were living through it now, Biden said in New Jersey on Tuesday in the latest stop of his wild weather tour. One analyst warned Tuesday on CNN that forecasters may have to come up with a new level on the hurricane magnitude scale  Category Six  if storms turned into monsters by warmer seawater get much worse. The US climate crisis has also sparked severe wildfires and drought this year. Luckily, Biden does have a plan. His $1.2 trillion infrastructure deal with Republicans and a $3.5 trillion spending plan are packed with investments designed to cut carbon emissions and to develop green energy and energy efficient vehicles and modes of transport. The bill is vital to US hopes of showing leadership at Novembers global climate meet in Scotland. Theres a problem, though. Sen. Joe Manchin, a moderate Democrat from West Virginia whose votes are key to passing bills in a 50-50 Senate, is having second thoughts about a $3 trillion-plus spending spree. Manchin says hes worried about inflation. But its probably no coincidence that hes a fierce defender of his storied coal-producing state. He can probably expect a call from Biden fairly soon. I think were at one of those inflection points where we either act or were going to be in real, real trouble; our kids are going to be in real trouble, the President said. Not a mask in sight. Americas big college football kickoff weekend brought its usual huge crowds to massive stadiums  many of them across the pigskin-crazy South, where the Delta coronavirus variant is running rampant. The scenes of tens of thousands of people crammed together was too much for the governments top infectious diseases specialist, Dr. Anthony Fauci. I dont think its smart, Fauci, a world-renowned virologist, told CNN. Theres not much chance that Faucis comments will suddenly empty stadiums. The massed crowds are a sign that many Americans  especially the young  have come to the end of their tether with Covid-19 restrictions  even as the pandemic hits historic levels in some states. And to borrow what may be an apocryphal quote attributed to a titan of round-ball football, legendary Liverpool FC manager Bill Shankly, football is not a matter of life and death; its more important than that. At the very least, Fauci, said, events like football games should require vaccinations Other experts warn that mass crowds are likely to seed new outbreaks of the disease, especially as the weather cools and people spend more time indoors. By this point, everyone in America  and nearly everywhere else  feels like the pandemic is endless. Its like climbing a mountain and after scaling a steep slope, discovering that the summit still looms far above. Nevertheless, Biden will try to instill a sense of urgency on Thursday. The White House is vowing a new six-point strategy to consign the crisis to the past. But if more than 1,500 new Covid deaths a day wont convince vaccine skeptics to change their minds, the chances of them being moved by another presidential speech seem slim.",08/09/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/08/world/meanwhile-in-america-september-8-hfr/index.html
Australia is shaping up to be the villain of COP26 climate talks,"If Australias allies were worried that the country might cause them problems at upcoming climate talks in Glasgow, the events of the past week should leave little doubt in their minds. It will. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Thursday all but confirmed a report that his country had pressured the UK into dropping key climate commitments from their bilateral trade agreement, showing no sign of regret or embarrassment at being caught out. And on Monday last week, when a senior UN official warned Australias climate inaction would eventually wreak havoc on its economy, Australias resources minister, Keith Pitt, dismissed the UN as a foreign body that should mind its own business. He even bragged about Australias plans to keep mining coal well beyond 2030, while much of the developed world is already well on its way to phasing out the fossil fuel. Australia is becoming increasingly isolated from the rest of the world with its obstinate approach to the climate crisis. Leaders like US climate envoy John Kerry and COP26 President Alok Sharma have been focused recently on the climate challenge of China  but its Australia thats emerging as the real pariah of the COP26 talks. Of all the developed countries, Australia has the poorest standing on climate. Its clear that Australia will just be absent, basically, from the talks, Bas Eickhout, a Dutch member of the European Parliament, told CNN. They were quite happy with the role the United States played until last year, and now of course they seem to be the last-man standing from the Western countries to block progress, he said, referring to the US absence in global climate efforts during the Trump years. The UK has also come under criticism for bowing to Australia in the countries bilateral trade agreement, in which an explicit reference to containing global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius appears to have been taken off the table. But a British official close to the negotiations in the lead-up to COP26 said that the UK had otherwise been consistent in its messaging to the Australian government to take the crisis more seriously. Part of that messaging included denying Morrison a slot to speak at the Climate Ambition Summit in December last year, an event organized by the UKs COP26 presidency, the UN and France. More than 70 leaders attended and spoke, and many announced improved emission-cutting pledges, known as a Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Australia had no new NDC to announce, and it still doesnt, having missed a July 31 deadline mandated by the Paris Agreement. Last December, we had a little bit more run time, so we were holding the bar very, very high, and you really had to earn your stripes to be able to speak, the UK official said. Theyre a developed country, theyve got huge amount of capacity, and theyre being devastated by climate change, quite frankly, and weve been pretty strict on that. They havent come forward with a long-term strategy. There are growing concerns among some delegates that Australia could stifle progress at COP26 talks in key areas. Sharma, who is also a British MP, has said he wants the world to put an end date on coal at the conference and to push for countries to refocus their commitments to containing global warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. The Paris Agreement obliged signatories to try to contain temperatures to 2 degrees, with a preference for closer to 1.5 degrees, but there has been a growing acceptance among many governments that the world should be aiming for 1.5. Scientists see 2 degrees as a critical threshold for many of the Earths ecosystems. But the comments in the past week from Australias leaders suggest they will push back on both coal and 1.5. We should increase the pressure on partners like Australia, Peter Liese, an EU member of Parliament from Germany, told CNN. He added he would be raising the challenge of Australias climate inaction in the European Parliament as a problem. He also said the logic behind Australias policy was difficult to understand. Theres a general hesitancy in Australia to commit to ambitious climate targets, and thats quite embarrassing for that country because they suffer already from climate change. Australia experienced devastating wildfires in 2019-20, events that scientists said were made more likely by human-induced climate change. The recent UN state-of-the science climate report found that Australia is already experiencing more heat extremes and higher sea level rises than the global average because of climate change. Heat, sea level rise and drought are all projected to increase in Australia the more the Earth warms. Australia has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 26% to 28% by 2030, from 2005 levels, a commitment that sits well below those made by the United States, European Union and United Kingdom, among other developed nations. US President Joe Biden, for example, increased his countrys pledge in April to reduce emissions by 50% to 52% in the same time frame. The Australian Climate Council, which is independent of the government, has suggested the country should slash emissions by 75% by 2030, compared to 2005 levels, to do its part in containing global warming to 1.5 degrees. Instead of focusing on immediate emissions reductions, the government has framed its climate response around tech not taxes, saying essentially it will transition to renewables when it becomes cheaper to do so. Removing the green premium  the price difference between current technologies and low emissions solutions  is the key to widespread global adoption and will make net zero achievable for all countries, the Australian Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources (DISER), which oversees climate policy, said in a statement to CNN on Monday. It reiterated its plans to continue to export coal to nations that are still developing, including China, India and South Korea. Australia has an important role to play in meeting that demand, it added. The Australian government in December last year technically updated its NDC, as it was obliged to do by the Paris Agreement before a July 31 deadline, but it did not actually increase its target to cut emissions. The point of the deadline was for countries to raise their climate ambitions. DISER told CNN it would release a long-term strategy on climate ahead of COP26. Australia will spell out its position in due course, it said. The countrys current pledges do not even put it on track to meet the requirements to keep global warming within 2 degrees Celsius, let alone 1.5, according to Climate Action Tracker, a group that monitors climate policies around the world. The watchdog said that if the whole world followed Australias policies, temperatures would rise by between 2 and 3 degrees. And while Australia says achieving carbon neutrality by mid-century would be preferable, its one of the only developed nations that hasnt actually committed to it. Even China, widely seen as a roadblock to international climate progress, has pledged carbon neutrality by 2060. A spokesperson for the European Union told CNN that the bloc hoped Australias ambition to reach net zero as soon as possible can be turned into a 2050 net zero target. Part of whats holding Australia back is the power that fossil fuel companies wield in the country. Australia is the worlds second-biggest coal exporter, after Indonesia. According to Pitt, the Australian resources minister, coal brought in around $50 billion in exports and more than $3 billion in royalties last financial year, and provides direct jobs for over 50,000 Australians, and supports the jobs of many more. More than 60% of the countrys electricity was generated by coal last year. In the UK, it was 1.6% in 2020. A shift to renewables in Australia has begun, but its been slow. Just 9% of the countrys electricity comes from the sun. Australia has the highest amount of solar radiation per square meter of land than any other continent. DISER said that there had been successful structural changes to the electricity sector, which has seen a reduction in emissions of 22.5% since it peaked in 2007. Meanwhile, as the UK, US and EU are designing green recoveries from the Covid-19 pandemic  boosting the use of renewables, like wind and solar energy, and setting targets to transition to electric cars  Australias plans center on increasing its exploration and use of natural gas, a fossil fuel that contributes to climate change. It strategy for electric vehicles doesnt involve any subsidies or put an end date on combustion engine cars. A report published on Thursday by the climate think tank InfluenceMap showed that fossil fuel companies are exerting a strong influence over Australian climate policy through well-funded lobbying, and that Australian businesses that are more vocally climate friendly are less engaged in lobbying the government in practice. The direction that the Australian government is taking  for example its recent trade negotiations with the UK  isnt coming out of a vacuum, InfluenceMap director Ed Collins told CNN. When it comes to lobbying for Paris-aligned climate policy, corporate Australia is largely missing in action. Collins said that Australia was a clear outlier from its peers in this dynamic. In the United States and Europe, for example, there are big companies actively pushing the government on climate policy. In Australia, thats not the case  its missing those strategically engaged, pro-climate corporate voices. It appears that lobbying fossil fuel companies have hijacked climate policy from the Australian people. Most Australians support more climate action from the government, according to a poll by the Lowy Institute in May. The poll found that 78% of Australians would support a net zero emissions target for 2050. Around the same number support the government subsidizing electric vehicles. And 63% support a ban on new coal mines opening in Australia. Yet of the worlds 176 new coal projects, 79 of them are in Australia, according to Fitch Solutions Global Mines Database. The real lobbying to government for improved climate policy is left largely to activist groups. Lucy Manne, the CEO of 350.org, which is an international organization with an Australian presence, accused the Morrison government of deliberately slowing down climate progress. This is extremely frustrating, and the government will only see the movement calling for action grow, she said. The Morrison government risks Australia becoming not just a pariah state on the world stage, but also our economy falling behind. Australia has the potential to become a clean energy superpower and exporter, and the Australian public wants us to be a leader, not a laggard.",13/09/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/12/australia/australia-climate-cop26-cmd-intl/index.html
"Most in the developed world think the US is doing a bad job on climate, Pew poll finds","Despite efforts from President Joe Biden to turn the United States into a global climate leader, most people in the advanced world dont think the US is doing a good job on the issue, and China is doing even worse, a new poll by the Pew Research Center published Tuesday shows. The poll, of more than 18,000 people in 17 developed economies, offers a detailed snapshot into concerns around the climate crisis. It comes as the US Congress is debating a massive spending bill with provisions to slash fossil-fuel emissions, and less than two months before the United Nations-brokered climate talks begin in Glasgow. Respondents expressed serious doubts that international climate efforts would effectively address the magnitude of the climate crisis  52% of respondents lacked confidence a multilateral response would be successful, while 46% were optimistic that nations could respond by cooperating. But the poll also suggested a growing awareness of the impacts of climate change, with 72% of respondents concerned that the climate crisis would personally harm them at some point during their lifetimes. In addition, 80% said they were willing to make personal sacrifices, or change their behavior, to address the crisis. Jacob Poushter, Pews associate director of research and one of the authors of the report, said while concerns around climate had grown since the centers last survey in 2015, it was still a polarizing issue in some parts of the advanced world. We do have a trend, where theres a lot more people who are very concerned about the personal harm of climate change since 2015, Poushter told CNN. This is especially true in Germany, the United Kingdom, Australia and South Korea. But theres pretty large ideological divides on a lot of these questions, he added. Theres more polarization on this issue in the US, and to some extent Australia, than many of the other countries that we surveyed. The US part of the poll was carried out in February, while respondents in the 16 other places took part between mid-March to nearly the end of May 2021. People were also surveyed in Canada, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Spain, Sweden, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. That was before extreme weather events over the summer hit much of the Northern Hemisphere in heatwaves, wildfires, hurricanes and flash flooding. Though many respondents live in parts of the world where such events are becoming increasingly common. In terms of the personal impact of the climate crisis, Germany, the UK, Australia and South Korea showed the biggest increases in the number of respondents saying they were very concerned about the crisis, compared with 2015 polling. South Koreans were most concerned overall, when looking at respondents who were either somewhat or very concerned (88%), followed by Greece (87%), Spain (81%), Italy (80%), France (77%) and Germany (75%). In Sweden, only 44% said they were somewhat or very concerned, followed by the Netherlands (59%), the United States (60%) and Australia (64%). In the US, public views about the climate crisis did not change significantly when compared with the 2015 poll. In contrast, Japan was the only place that saw a significant drop, 8 percentage points less, in the number of respondents very concerned about climate change. The decline comes as the country recorded its earliest cherry blossom season and faced deadly floods and heat waves in recent years, which scientists say are due to warming temperatures. Young adults were generally more concerned than their older counterparts about how warming temperatures would impact them personally, according to the poll. Sweden, home to the prominent youth climate activist Greta Thunberg, came out with the widest generational gap, with 65% of 18- to 29-year-olds at least somewhat concerned about the climate crisis affecting them, 40 percentage points higher than adults 65 and older. The US, Canada, France, New Zealand, and Australia also saw a substantial age gap in public view about the rapidly warming planet. But over-65s in Greece and South Korea were more concerned than the younger age group. Its not new to us that younger people around the world are more concerned about climate change, said Poushter. Its the same when we asked the question of whether global climate change is a threat  and so thats really a consistent binding that we had. Women were also more concerned about the personal impacts of climate change than men in the surveyed publics. In Germany, for instance, 82% of women compared to 69% of men expressed concern. Public views on climate change also fell along the political spectrum. Those on the left were more inclined to take personal steps to mitigate the crisis. The results ring particularly true in the US, where 94% of people who identify with the left are more likely to alter the way they live and work to save the planet. Eri Yamasumi, a specialist for climate strategies and policy at the UN Development Program, said the polls findings chime with those of a similar but larger survey she worked on with the University of Oxford released early this year. The Pew survey reaffirms the fact that people see a high personal threat from climate change  not only in the small island developing states, least developed countries and fragile contexts but also in many places in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific, Yamasumi, who was not involved with the Pew report, told CNN. Addressing the climate crisis requires big changes and its important to understand how the public sees these changes, she added. The report also revealed mixed views on having a larger, collective response to the crisis. Climate researchers have said that no amount of individual action can address the magnitude of the problem, instead governments should commit to bold, global policies that hold industries accountable for its role in perpetuating the crisis. Many respondents were critical of how the US, which relies heavily on fossil fuels, has been handling the climate crisis. A median of 33% of respondents in the poll said the US was doing a somewhat good job, while only 3% said it was doing a very good job. Among US respondents, there is slightly more confidence, with 39% polled said the country is doing a somewhat good job, and 8% said it was doing very good job. Much like the US, China also received critical polling numbers, with 78% saying it was doing a very bad job dealing with global climate change. Over a month after the survey, deadly flooding from heavy rainfall killed hundreds of people in the Chinese province of Henan. Fewer are confident that the international community can deal with climate change, especially when it comes to views of the United States and China, Poushter told CNN. Theres a lot of doubts that those two countries, which are the two largest emitters in the world, are actually doing a good job of dealing with the issue. Unlike the US and China  which are the worlds two largest economies and greenhouse gas emitters  the European Union and the United Nations generally received more positive opinions over their action on climate. The results come as tensions between US and China escalate ahead of COP26, when global leaders gather to tackle a warming world and make stringent commitments to reach net-zero carbon emissions. On Friday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged the two countries to avoid any problems that would get in the way of international climate talks. And since the polling happened before many climate change-fueled disasters this summer, Poushter said that public opinion may have shifted further in the time since the poll. He noted too that the Covid-19 pandemic had limited the scope of the survey. Unfortunately, this is only among sort of advanced economies where we know that telephone surveying works because of the pandemic, Poushter said. In a typical year, we would be going to those other countries and getting a broader view of how climate change and other issues are affecting people in the more developing and emerging economies of the world. As people around the world become more exposed to the consequences of climate change, experts say public awareness about the impacts is necessary. The state-of-the-science report from the UNs Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns that the planet is warming faster than scientists had previously thought. Deep and sustained cuts to emissions are needed over this decade to give the Earth a chance of containing average global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, to avoid worsening climate change impacts and passing critical thresholds for many ecosystems. People are seeing the climate crisis in their own backyards, Yamasumi said. Public awareness of the crisis is critical  both for education and to encourage all countries to take the bold action needed to keep people and planet safe for generations to come.",14/09/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/14/world/climate-change-public-view-survey/index.html
"Not a single G20 country is in line with the Paris Agreement on climate, analysis shows","None of the worlds major economies  including the entire G20  have a climate plan that meets their obligations under the 2015 Paris Agreement, according to an analysis published Wednesday, despite scientists warning that deep cuts to greenhouse gas emissions are needed now. The watchdog Climate Action Tracker (CAT) analyzed the policies of 36 countries, as well as the 27-nation European Union, and found that all major economies were off track to contain global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The countries together make up 80% of the worlds emissions. The analysis also included some low-emissions countries, and found that the Gambia was the only nation among all 37 to be 1.5 compatible. As the study only included a few smaller emitters, its possible there are other developing countries in the world on track as well. Under the 2015 Paris accord, more than 190 countries agreed to limit the increase in global temperatures to well below 2 degrees above pre-industrial temperatures  ideally to 1.5 degrees. Scientists have said 2 degrees is a critical threshold for some of the Earths ecosystems, and is one that would also trigger more catastrophic extreme weather events. The report comes less than two months ahead of UN-brokered international climate talks in Glasgow, known as COP26. The events president, British MP Alok Sharma, has said he hopes to keep 1.5 alive as a global warming limit. CAT reported that progress had stalled after dozens of world leaders made ambitious new pledges to slash greenhouse gas emissions during the US President Joe Bidens Climate Leaders Summit in April. In May, after the Climate Leaders Summit and the Petersburg dialogue, we reported that there appeared to be good momentum with new climate action commitments, said Niklas Hohne, a founding partner of the NewClimate Institute, a CAT partner. But since then, there has been little to no improvement: nothing is moving, he said. Anyone would think they have all the time in the world, when in fact the opposite is the case. Six countries, including the UK, have an overall climate policy that is nearly sufficient, according to the report, meaning they are not yet consistent with 1.5-degree alignment but could be with small improvements. The UKs targets are in line with 1.5 degrees, but its policies in practice dont meet the benchmark. The overall climate plans of the US, European Union and Japan are not sufficient to reach the 1.5-degree goal, the analysis found, saying that while their domestic targets are relatively close to where they need to be, their international policies are not. CAT had previously categorized the US as critically insufficient  the worst category  under former President Donald Trump, who formally withdrew the country from the Paris Agreement shortly before the end of his term. The United States domestic emission-cutting target has since been upgraded to almost sufficient. However, the US is still insufficient in CATs fair share target rating, which takes into account the countrys responsibility and capability. Under the Paris agreement, countries submitted their pledges to cut emissions, also known as Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs. All signatories were supposed to update their NDCs by July 31 this year under the Paris accord. There are still more than 70 countries that have yet to submit an update. India, Saudi Arabia and Turkey are among countries that missed the July 31 deadline. China, the worlds biggest polluter, announced a new target, but hasnt formally submitted it to the UN. And many countries submitted an update without actually increasing their pledge. Brazil and Mexico submitted the same targets as they did in 2015. Changes to those countries baseline assumptions make their pledges weaker than they were before, the analysis showed. Russia, the CAT report said, submitted an update that looks stronger on paper, but doesnt amount to meaningful change. Of particular concern are Australia, Brazil, Indonesia Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, Switzerland and Vietnam: they have failed to lift ambition at all, submitting the same or even less ambitious 2030 targets than those they put forward in 2015. These countries need to rethink their choice, said Bill Hare, CEO of Climate Analytics, another CAT partner. The continued use of coal remains a significant policy problem, the report found, with China and India retaining huge coal pipelines. Indonesia, Vietnam, Japan and South Korea are also planning to go ahead with coal use in the future. CAT also warned that in many countries attempts to wean of coal, which is generally the fossil fuels that causes the most emissions, many countries were looking to use more natural gas, which CAT said was being falsely sold as a bridging fuel. The Australian government, which has said it will keep mining coal past 2030, is also investing money into new gas exploration and infrastructure, and is of particular concern, CAT said in its report. Thailand has plans to ramp up new gas as it phases out coal, while the EU is still planning to commit public funding to new gas infrastructure, and various member states are lobbying hard for the continued use of this fossil fuel. Hare warned against the development of blue hydrogen, based on natural gas, as an alternative to other fossil fuels. Gas is a fossil fuel, and any investment into gas today risks becoming a stranded asset. And while interest in green hydrogen has grown exponentially, there is still a large number of hydrogen projects in the pipeline where its produced from gas, Hare said. Hydrogen produced from gas still produces carbon, and is inconsistent with reaching net zero. Cutting emissions is a non-negotiable part of the Paris Accord. Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases trap solar radiation in the atmosphere, just like glass traps heat in a greenhouse. This causes temperatures to rise and drives more extreme weather, ice melt, sea level rise and ocean acidification. To keep the warming under 1.5 degrees, the world needs to reach net zero by 2050, a landmark UN climate science report published in August showed. Net zero refers to a state when the amount of greenhouse gas emitted is no greater than the amount removed from the atmosphere. According to UN Climate Change, just over 130 countries have pledged to cut emissions to net-zero so far. The new analysis by CAT found that even if all of them followed up on their plans, warming would still reach 2 degrees. If they stick with the policies they have in place, temperatures will likely be 2.4 degrees higher by the end of century. Temperatures are already around 1.2 degrees higher than they were before humans started burning huge amounts of fossil fuels, so room for error is very limited. An increasing number of people around the world are suffering from ever more severe and frequent impacts of climate change, yet government action continues to lag behind what is needed, said Bill Hare, the CEO of the think tank Climate Analytics and another author of the analysis. While many governments have committed to net zero, Hare said that without a real action soon, achieving net zero will be virtually impossible.",15/09/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/15/world/climate-pledges-insufficient-cat-intl/index.html
"The planet is on a ?atastrophic?global warming path, UN report shows","The planet is careening toward warming of 2.7 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels  far above what scientists say the world should be targeting  according to a report on global emissions targets by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Scientists have said that the planet needs to slash 45% of its emissions by 2030 to reach carbon neutrality by mid-century. But under current emissions commitments from countries there will be a 16% increase in emissions in 2030 compared to 2010 levels, according to the report. That would lead the planet to warm to 2.7 degrees above pre-industrial levels, the report says. Scientists have said global temperatures should remain below 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels to stave off the worse consequences of the climate crisis. A UN report in August showed global temperature is already around 1.2 degrees of warming. In a statement about todays report, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the planets current path catastrophic. This is breaking the promise made six years ago to pursue the 1.5-degree Celsius goal of the Paris Agreement, Guterres said. Failure to meet this goal will be measured in the massive loss of lives and livelihoods. The report comes after a summer filled with climate change-fueled extreme weather around the world: While the Western US has been battered by wildfires, worsened by unrelenting drought, flooding events and hurricanes, China and Germany experienced deadly flooding events in July as Southern Europe battled wildfires of its own. Addressing leaders at the Major Economies Forum on Friday morning, Guterres said that the UN climate conference in November, during which world leaders will meet to discuss emissions targets, has a high risk of failure. It is clear that everyone must assume their responsibilities, Guterres said. In his statement about the report, Guterres urged all countries to submit more ambitious climate targets, or Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), that would create a more feasible pathway to 1.5 degrees. He also pressed developed nations to push forward with the decade-long, $100-billion promise to support developing countries with their own commitments. The NDCs create the foundation for nations to achieve the commitments of the 2015 Paris Agreement. They include information on targets, climate policies, and measures for reducing national greenhouse gas emissions. The NDCs also lay out the need for financing and technology to meet the targets. According to the UNs interim NDC registry, there are currently 191 parties to the Paris Agreement, all of whom have submitted their first NDCs. Eritrea is the only country that has not yet become a party to the Paris Agreement, but has submitted its own NDC. But only 59% of the parties have submitted new or updated NDCs, according to the UN. This report is clear: ambitious climate action can avoid the most devastating effects of climate change, but only if all nations act together, Alok Sharma, incoming COP26 President, said. Those nations which have submitted new and ambitious climate plans are already bending the curve of emissions downwards by 2030. But without action from all countries, especially the biggest economies, these efforts risk being in vain, Sharma added. During the Major Economies Forum  a virtual and closed-door meeting with other world leaders on climate  on Friday, President Joe Biden announced the United States and European Union have launched a global pledge to reduce emissions of methane  a potent greenhouse gas  by nearly 30% by the end of the decade. Additionally, as part of the UN General Assembly in New York, the energy and climate ministers of Denmark and Costa Rica announced an effort to encourage countries to transition away from oil and gas production. We have the tools to achieve this target, Guterres said. But we are rapidly running out of time.",17/09/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/17/us/catastrophic-climate-change-un-report/index.html
"High temperatures, wildfire smoke and drought: The politics of climate change in one California congressional district","The changing climate is everywhere Gustavo Carranza looks when he walks through his undulating citrus farm here in this tiny town in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. The summer temperatures are consistently higher than they used to be. The smoke from nearby wildfires fills the sky, obscuring the sun and speckling his mandarin trees with delicate ash. And, most concerning, the water he needs to run his 150-acre farm has become so scarce that Carranza, the son of farm workers in Californias Central Valley who grew up picking and pruning every weekend, is worried about encouraging his own children to take over the farm he and his brothers founded two decades ago. That uncertainty of the water situation, its like you cant feel that happy about them trying to come back to the family business, said Carranza, who considered selling his farm during the last drought in 2014 and 2015. And that is a bad feeling. He added: Theres probably four or five different things that could kill our business. But if we have water, we can work on the others. If you dont have water, these trees will die. Here in Americas so-called fruit basket, where roughly one-quarter of the nations food is produced, drought is everywhere. Rivers have turned into nothing but sandy lines on maps, countless irrigation canals are parched and so much water has been pulled from underground aquafers that the ground in some areas is physically sinking. According to the US Drought Monitor, much of the Central Valley has reached exceptional drought levels, the groups highest intensity. These realities have made the area politically unique, too: There are few congressional districts more impacted by climate change, on a day-to-day basis than Californias 21st, a sweep of farmland from Bakersfield to Fresno that has become one of the most contested districts in recent history. The district, which some studies finding is well over 70% Hispanic  backed Joe Biden over Donald Trump by nearly 11 percentage points in 2020. It is currently represented by Republican Rep. David Valadao, making the district the most Democratic to be represented by a Republican in Congress. But Valadao has been in a constant fight to keep his seat - first being elected in 2013, before being ousted in 2018 and winning his seat back in 2020. Valadao laughed when asked about the fact that he is seen as one of the most vulnerable Republicans in the country. His decision to vote in favor of impeaching Trump earlier this year, making him just one of 10 Republicans in the House to do so, drew the ire of the right and won cheers from the left. A Republican rancher is now challenging Valadao almost entirely on that vote, with rumors of other Republicans planning to get in the race. A slew of Democrats, many of whom applauded his impeachment decision, have also lined up to knock off the Republican congressman, citing his record on a host of issues, including climate change. Valadao took a more nuanced view of climate change as he spoke with CNN at a walnut farm in Fowler, California, acknowledging that he is a person who thinks that the climate is changing and admitting that his party could do more to push on the issue. But Valadao also argued that drought has long been a common situation in the Central Valley and that the nearby fires are stronger because of the way forest in the state are managed, not necessarily because climate change is making them worse. Weve always had drier years and wetter years. Do I think that theres a possibility that it plays a role? Im sure that the climate changing is going to play a role in the long term, he asked. What can we do to fix that? Democrats and Republicans throughout the Central Valley agree that water is likely the most pressing issue there. Its how to address the issue that splits the parties. Valadao has primarily focused on how to mitigate the water issues, stressing the need to renew the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act, a bill that looks to address water issues, and spend the needed money to increase storage of surface water. He, like many of his Republican colleagues in the district, also blames strict environmental policies regulating endangered fish in the California Delta for part of the water issues. A lot of us see a lot of hypocrisy on the issue, Valadao said. He pointed to San Francisco getting most of its water from the Hetch Hetchy reservoir but environmental activists, primarily those who live in the Bay Area, castigate any plans for more water storage to benefit the Central Valley. They live in a totally different world and theyre doing exactly what were trying to do for ourselves. For him, the issue is personal: He was born in Hanford and his family had been in the dairy industry for much of Valadaos life before the family business went bankrupt. Standing with Doug Verboon and Craig Pedersen, two Kings County Supervisors, Valadao recalls floating down a now entirely dry Kings River on the outskirts of town. As congressman, he deals with water issues constantly  he says any time he has a tele-town hall, 30 to 40% of the questions involve water  and a lot of that involves the web of contracts that farmers have with a mix of federal, state and local groups. In looking at the political environment that we live in today, all of the years of efforts in trying to explain to folks that water equals food, and it takes people and communities to grow that. And we have gotten nowhere, nowhere, said Pedersen, arguing that because the political power in California rests in Southern California and the Bay Area, little attention is given to the Central Valley. Our infrastructure hasnt changed  developed for 15 million people, here we are at 44 million people. Theres going to be winners and losers. And right now, weve continually been on the losing side of things. And many in his district arent hiding their disdain for a water policy that benefits cities. Farmers are desperate for more water storage and large signs along highways in the Central Valley rage against what they see as a lack of action by the federal and state governments. Some are overtly political, like one that borrows from Trumps Make America Great Again, slogan: Build More Damns, Stop Man-Made Droughts. Valadao attempted to get more amendments dealing with water into the infrastructure bill currently being debating in Congress. The current bill has somewhere around $40 billion for water infrastructure, Valadao said. Its never enough, he said, and hasnt decided to yet on whether to support it on final passage. Theres no such thing as a silver bullet, he added, but said the two things that could be done is smarter policy on the way we manage our water with our current infrastructure and then growing the infrastructure. Those two are the easiest solutions. To his Democratic opponents in 2022, Valadaos language is hollow. The congressman currently faces three Democratic opponents in the midterm elections  Bryan Osorio, the 25-year-old mayor of Delano; Angel Lara, a 26-year-old former aide to California Sen. Dianne Feinstein; and Nicole Parra, a former state assemblywoman  and multiple Democratic sources say that state assemblyman Rudy Salas, someone long seen as a top recruit to run against Valadao, is planning to run for the seat. Salas did not respond to CNNs request for an interview. The legislation put in place by the current Republican incumbent doesnt address climate change, said Lara, a Bakersfield native whose mother was a farm worker. In order to have to have stability, that root cause of climate change needs to be addressed. Talk is cheap. The legislation hasnt gone anywhere. Its stagnant. The impacts in California have been dramatic. Reservoirs across the state are perilously low, threatening the hydroelectric energy that flows directly to the states major cities and the surface water that can be used by farmers. In August, regulators with the board that oversees water allocations in California voted to halt diversions from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, a major step that will directly impact those using water for agriculture. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has asked residents to cut their water usage by 15% in response to the drought. Because drought is gripping much of the Western United States, these issues are far from unique to just California, with water authorities across the country having to take action to protect delicate watersheds. The most significant came in August when the federal government declared a water shortage on the Colorado River for the first time, triggering mandatory water consumption cuts for states in the Southwest. Osorio described an environment where even the slightest shift in water scarcity impacts every person in the community, from the farmer who may have to switch crops to the farm worker whose well may become contaminated to the city officials who worry about the economic impact and the stability of their own municipal wells. All of this, he said, stems back to climate change. On the issue of water and drought, it is very important to acknowledge climate change and I dont think Valadao has done a very good job in doing that, he said. We have to mitigate the impacts of the drought, but we also have to look at what is causing the drought. This starts with acknowledging the impacts of climate change. Water is a constant concern for many who live in Valadaos district  and it isnt just about quantity. Because surface water has been so scarce in recent years, farmers and towns have had to lean more on ground water, pumping it from vast underground aquafers that have long been a reliable back up plan for the dry years in the Central Valley. With so many dry years coming back-to-back, however, more and more wells are coming up dry  creating a scenario where the vast network of farm workers in the district are spending their days working on water-starved farms and are coming home to concerns about contaminated water. Scientists who have studied the climate impacts on farm workers in the Central Valley have found complex reactions. J. Pablo Ortiz-Partida, a scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, and Angel S. Fernandez-Bou, a researcher at the University of California, Merced, found in their work that while water concerns are pressing, many feel air quality and heat are equally concerning. Farm workers that have been experienced these conditions are conscience of the changes, said Ortiz-Partida, who noted many farm workers who have worked fields for decades have physically felt the heat rise and the air quality diminish. And these extremes are exacerbated by climate change, Fernandez-Bou said. The United Farm Workers, the union that pioneered the rights of farm workers in the United States in the 1960s, has also criticized Valadao for focusing more on the impact the drought has on farmers and less on their workers. Valadao represents workers too, and to our knowledge he hasnt talked with workers at all about water policies, said Elizabeth Strater, a strategist for the union. Hes talking to their bosses, sure. But hes not talking to the workers. Theyre living in the communities facing the harshest symptoms of climate change drought conditions. To Parra, these water issues are second nature  the congressional candidate dealt extensively with water during her time in the state Assembly. She was also punished for pushing the issue, she recalled, getting physically booted from her office in the California state Capitol to a building across the street after she failed to vote for her own partys budget over water and agriculture concerns. Parra, who prides herself in being a moderate, said she would be willing to do the same over water issues if she were elected to Congress, and echoed a more-Republican sentiment that the Central Valley is getting the short end of the stick to Californias urban area. It just seems like this is two Californias when it comes to those who are making the rules and regulations regarding air quality issues, climate change and when we are talking about the drought, Parra said. Climate change is making the events we are seeing as more extreme and for a longer duration. ... Its making them longer, more extreme and mother nature is not happy and we need to do thing about it. What makes Valadao so unique in Congress is that he is a Republican in a Democratic district who, because of his vote on impeachment, is also getting attacked from the right of his own party. Chris Mathys, a former city councilman in Fresno, is mounting a campaign against Valadao by pledging to do everything in my power to defeat Congressman David Valadao who voted to impeach President Donald Trump. Mathys odds are long  Valadao has a deep well of support in a district that leans left  but he could create problems for the congressman by firing up a pro-Trump base that already raged at Valadao in the wake of his vote. It was a betrayal of conservative Republican principles, Mathys said, standing next to his truck that both touts his campaign and makes clear he is running against Valadao. President Trump helped David Valadao get elected and a week after he wins, he votes to impeach him and calls him un-American, he said. Where Valadao voted for impeachment, Mathys has backed the baseless claims that the 2020 election was stolen, and Biden is not the rightful president. While Valadao acknowledged climate change, Mathys would not, making clear that he believes the water issues facing his would-be constituents stem from poor leadership, not the changing climate. I strongly believe climate change is not an issue of the world changing. I think its an issue of a natural progression, he said. Whats making their lives harder is not climate change, but its the poor leadership that weve had in the valley. Valadao was largely dismissive of Mathys and stood by his vote for impeachment, despite the blowback he received at home. If someone is going to run in a district like this based off of one vote on a person that lost the district, everyone who supports that type of mentality has literally given up the opportunity to win a seat and put someone in a spot that could actually fight for them and do whats right for the district, Valadao said. If their only issue is one vote, thats a pretty short-sighted mentality. Valadao, because of the political make-up of the district, knows he is in for another fight come November. He has seen his Democratic opponents line up and tie him to Trump, the man he voted to impeach. And he has seen his Republican opponents argue he wasnt loyal enough to Trump. For this calculation to work, Valadao needs supporters like Gary Serrato, a dried-on-the-vine raisin farmer and former general manager of the Fresno Irrigation District who vote for him in 2020. But he worries that Valadao is a man without a party  targeted by both Democrats and Republicans  and therefore will be ineffective in the coming years. I like Valadao and Valadao is out there doing what he can for the valley, but hes a target, Serrato said. And we need somebody thats going to be able to make change today. Today. We cant wait for another four years, another five years.",18/09/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/18/politics/drought-climate-change-california-21-congressional-district/index.html
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson says the world needs to ?row up?and deal with climate change,"Humanity needs to grow up and deal with the issue of climate change, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Wednesday. Johnson, a last-minute addition to the speakers list that day, slammed the worlds inadequate response to the climate crisis and urged humanity to listen to the warnings of the scientists, pointing to the Covid-19 pandemic as an example of gloomy scientists being proved right. We still cling with parts of our minds to the infantile belief that the world was made for our gratification and pleasure, he said. And we combine this narcissism with an assumption of our own immortality. We believe that someone else will clear up the mess, because that is what someone else has always done, he added. We trash our habitats, again and again, with the inductive reasoning that weve gotten away with it so far, and therefore, well get away with it again. My friends, the adolescence of humanity is coming to an end and must come to an end. Johnson highlighted the UN Climate Change Conference  known as COP26  in Glasgow in November as a turning point for humanity. World leaders need to arrive in Scotland ready to make necessary commitments, he said. Its already too late to stop the rise in global temperatures, but the world can still restrain that growth to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The 1.5-degree marker has been identified by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as a key tipping point beyond which the risk of extreme drought, wildfires, floods and food shortages will increase dramatically. The World Meteorological Organization predicts we now have a roughly 40% chance of reaching that level  even if temporarily  within the next five years. To prevent crossing that threshold, we need to pledge collectively to achieve carbon neutrality, net zero, by the middle of the century, Johnson said on Wednesday. We need all countries, every single one of you, to step up the commitment to very substantial reductions by 2030. The Prime Minister held a closed meeting with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and other world leaders Monday to urge nations to pledge funding to help developing nations move away from fossil fuels. Climate has been a key pillar of the conference so far, and it seems Johnsons appeal has resonated with other world leaders concerned about the climate crisis. In a speech to the UNGA on Tuesday, US President Joe Biden announced the US would double its financial commitment to helping developing nations tackle the climate crisis. In a meeting with Biden on Tuesday, Johnson hailed the US Presidents speech as the most important thing today. Chinese President Xi Jinping also made a major new pledge to stop building coal projects overseas, and increase financial support for green and low-carbon energy projects in other developing countries.",23/09/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/22/uk/boris-johnson-climate-change-unga-cop26-intl-hnk/index.html
Climate change is intensifying the US border crisis. It will only get worse,"In the face of political turmoil following the assassination of the countrys president, a 7.2-magnitude earthquake that killed more than 1,000 people and a tropical storm, Haitians are fleeing their country. More than 10,000 migrants from Haiti converged on the US border at Del Rio, Texas, this week and up to 30,000 may also be seeking to travel north. Their experiences are similar to those of migrants from Central and South America, where political and economic instability and climate change are threatening their livelihoods. In conversations with CNN, Haitians have pointed to social unrest, poverty and earthquakes among the reasons for their migration. The present border crisis paints a picture of how natural disasters  and their trickle-down effects  can push people to leave their homes, even if it means risking their lives. Haiti is one particular important case, but it is connected to a wider story of the dispossession of Black people, especially in the Caribbean, Keston K. Perry, a political economist and assistant professor of Africana studies at Williams College, told CNN. Making the connection between existing inequalities that are linked to colonialism and enslavement of African peoples is important for us to understand how these communities have become particularly vulnerable and exposed to climate change. Research has shown that climate migration will become more likely as the planet warms and people seek places they consider safer and more economically stable. According to a UN report in April, weather disasters linked to climate change have pushed roughly 21.5 million people in countries already struggling with conflict to move each year, on average, since 2010. Though migrants dont often cite it as their primary reason for leaving their homes, a 2020 study found connections between the climate crisis and its effects on safety, the economy and migrants livelihoods. Making a decision to leave their own country has to be the very last resort, Perry said. They are unable to meet the resources, recovery and relief needs on a yearly basis, when they experience calamities like landslides, flooding and hurricanes that were seeing happening more frequently  and so were going to be seeing more forms of migration. The impact of climate change on the US border crisis should not surprise anyone, Democratic Sen. Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico told CNN. The National Security Assessment has been clear from the very beginning on this, Lujan said. The US and our allies have to take the climate crisis seriously in all aspects of this, or everything is going to get worse. The science is clear, were seeing it play out in front of our very eyes. President Joe Biden recently requested a national intelligence estimate, the intelligence communitys most significant intelligence product, to explore the security implications of the climate crisis, a senior State Department official told CNN. The official said the concern about a global refugee crisis, triggered by more frequent extreme weather, is really is the guiding force behind the request for the report. The President wanted to make sure that we have a good understanding and a comprehensive understanding of this challenge, the official said, speaking about the link between climate change and migration. It is going to be so massive and we understand that and we want to make sure that we see the ramifications, the consequences, the risks, and also what kinds of policy options exist today that are working well. But Perry, whos originally from Trinidad and Tobago himself, said the US is contributing to the problem with its rampant fossil fuel emissions, and because it has not provided necessary climate financing to assist developing nations. The United States is not being held responsible, given it is the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions globally, he said. It has not shown any form of interest in supporting these people, who are escaping various forms of climate and agricultural crises that are linked to forms of intervention that the US has taken in those countries. A spokesperson for the White House told CNN the US has committed to bold, ambitious climate goals, including Bidens target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by around 50% of 2005 levels by 2030. Simultaneously, the spokesperson said, the Biden Administration continues to implement a comprehensive strategy to address the factors that drive people to leave their countries, create legal channels to migrate, create protection for people in the region, reform our asylum system and deter irregular migration. As the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere, according to the World Bank, Haiti is extremely vulnerable to natural disasters with more than 90% of the population at risk. Across the Caribbean, climate change is expected to accelerate the frequency and intensity of extreme weather hazards, including hurricanes. Central American countries including Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua have also been facing life-threatening levels of food insecurity as a result of years-long blistering drought and intensifying storms. And much like vast swaths of the Western US, a 2020 study published in the journal Environmental Research Letters found that the frequency, length and intensity of droughts in these countries will increase as temperatures continue to warm through the end of the century. Rep. Raul Grijalva, an Arizona Democrat and chair of the House Natural Resources Committee, said climate migration isnt unique to the United States, but it is in the countrys interest to lead since its already a destination for people who are fleeing their homelands. Like it or not, this beacon  the US-of-A  is out there, Grijalva told CNN. People see that as a refuge, they see it as a new start, and they see it as an escape, and that force is not going away. Even if migrants achieve their goal of settling in the US, they still face impacts of the climate crisis. This summer alone, an unprecedented heatwave killed hundreds in the Northwest, and Hurricane Ida devastated the Gulf Coast and Northeast with flooding. The West is in the grips of a historic drought that has caused water shortages. On the US-Mexico border, most migrants cross the Rio Grande Valley in Texas. The region is one of the fastest-growing places in the US, but it is also getting hotter and drier for people living there. The Rio Grande river, which provides drinking and irrigation water to 6 million people and 2 million acres of farmland for both countries, is draining as heatwaves become more severe and rainfall decreases. Perry said developed nations like the US should expect to see more migrants and refugees attempting to escape intensifying disasters. These crises reveal what has been going on beneath the surface in terms of structural inequities, Perry said. At the end of the day, given what is happening in Haiti and in other parts of Latin America and the Caribbean, we are going to see future events of this kind, especially as the planet warms.",26/09/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/26/us/climate-change-migration-border-haiti/index.html
Scott Morrison may snub the COP26 climate talks as Australia becomes more isolated,"Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Monday he might not show up at the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow this November, as his government becomes increasingly isolated in international efforts on the crisis. More than 100 world leaders, including US President Joe Biden, have confirmed their attendance at the talks hosted by the United Kingdom, a close ally of Australia. Leaders of the G20, which includes Australia, will be convening in Rome a day ahead of the climate talks. While it is not yet confirmed if Morrison will be at that summit, many G20 leaders are likely to take the short flight from the Italian capital to COP26 in Scotland. We havent made any final decisions about (attending COP26). I mean it is another trip overseas and Ive been on several this year and spent a lot of time in quarantine, Morrison told the West Australian newspaper. Morrison said he needed to focus on the countrys reopening after an extended lockdown. His government is aiming to relax its hardline border restrictions in December. Australia will be opening up around that time, there will be a lot of issues to manage and I have to manage those competing demands, he said. The Prime Minister made his comments as Australia comes under pressure from allies, including the United States, to announce more ambitious pledges on the climate crisis. The country is the worlds second-biggest exporter of coal and the Morrison government has said it will continue to mine, export and use the fossil fuel well beyond 2030. Leaders including COP26 President Alok Sharma and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres have called on the developed world to end the use of coal by the end of this decade. Morrisons office did not immediately respond to CNNs questions on the Prime Ministers plans for COP26. I am bringing the Government and I hope the country together on where we are seeking to go and we are working though our commitments, we are working through our plans ... a plan gives people certainty about the big change that will occur over the next 20-30 years, Morrison told the West Australian. The Australian government has been promising a new long-term emissions plan ahead of the talks for months. Morrison made no announcements on any new plans on Friday when he addressed the UN General Assembly in New York in a pre-recorded video. He has said that the countrys plan will focus on tech not taxes. Australia is one of just a handful of countries that did not increase its target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions when registering its official update on its climate plans to the UN last year. It sent its update on December 31 with little fanfare, keeping its target to a 26-28% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, from 2005 levels. The Australian Climate Council, which is independent of the government, has suggested the country should slash emissions by 75% by 2030, compared to 2005 levels, to do its part in containing global warming to 1.5 degrees. More than 190 countries signed up to the Paris Agreement in 2015, in which they committed to trying to contain global warming to 2 degrees, but preferably 1.5 degrees, above pre-industrial levels to stave off the more catastrophic impacts of the climate crisis. Australias target sits well below those made by the US, European Union and UK, among other developed nations. Speaking to Australias ABC radio on Monday, Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne confirmed no final decision has been made on whether Morrison would attend the talks or whether she would stand in his place, but said Australia will be strongly represented at COP26 no matter which senior Australian representative attends. One thing we are absolutely committed to, as we have said, is setting out our long-term emissions reduction plan prior to the COP and that is what we are focused on as a government, Payne said in the interview. Australia is becoming increasingly isolated on the world stage because of its climate failings. US officials pressed Australian ministers on their countrys climate record at a recent defense meeting in Washington, mentioning the urgency of the climate crisis in a communique that Morrison signed. Members of the EU Parliament have told CNN in recent weeks that Australia has one of the worst climate records of all developed nations and some expressed incredulity when it emerged that Australian negotiators had pressured the UK into dropping key climate commitments from their bilateral trade agreement. And comments from Australias resources minister Keith Pitt dismissing the UN as a foreign body that should stay out of Australias affairs has only worsened the countrys image as an uncooperative player in climate action. COP26 comes at a crucial time for the worlds efforts on the climate crisis. A state-of-the-science report published by the UN in August showed that the world is warming faster than scientists previously thought, and that slashing greenhouse gas emissions by at least half this decade is crucial to staving off the more catastrophic impacts of climate change. Australia is already experiencing more heat extremes and higher sea level rises than the global average because of the crisis. Heat, sea level rise and drought are all projected to increase in Australia the more the Earth warms, the report found.",27/09/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/27/australia/australia-morrison-skip-climate-cop26-glasgow-intl-hnk/index.html
"Want to help the climate crisis? Don? toss your old iPhone, fix it","The life cycle of a smartphone begins in mines around the world. There, raw materials and rare earth metals are extracted from the planet in an energy-intensive process. Those materials get transported to factories where theyre refined, often using high temperatures and significant energy, and turned into components like batteries, wires, logic boards and motors. The components are then transferred by fossil fuel-powered vehicles to yet more factories to be assembled into complete devices, before being shipped to consumers around the world. As taxing as this manufacturing process is on the environment, its only made worse by how quickly most consumers discard their phones. Manufacturers have made it difficult to repair devices, and replacing them is often an easier and less expensive solution for consumers, further contributing to the already-dire climate crisis. The greenest smartphone is the one you already own, said Cole Stratton, an associate instructor at Indiana University Bloomington, who has studied tech supply chains. Smartphones seem so small and inconsequential, so unless youve studied the supply chains and realized everything that goes into creating [them], you really just have no sense of how environmentally devastating these things are. The growing right-to-repair movement could help. Right-to-repair advocates, including Apple (AAPL) co-founder Steve Wozniak, are calling for laws that would require device makers to release the tools, parts and repair manuals necessary to allow consumers to have their products fixed by independent shops  or to do it themselves. If consumers could more easily repair devices, advocates say, they wouldnt have to replace them as frequently, reducing reliance on the resource-intensive production process and cutting down on electronic waste. And its not just smartphones: Right-to-repair could make it easier to fix everything from tablets to tractors. Regulators are starting to take notice. US President Joe Biden recently directed the Federal Trade Commission to issue rules preventing manufacturers from imposing restrictions that make it hard to repair devices. A week later, the FTC committed to investigating repair restrictions that may be illegal under federal antitrust and consumer protection laws. European regulators, meanwhile, have been out front on right-to-repair, implementing rules earlier this year that require manufacturers of devices like washing machines and TV displays to make parts and repair manuals available to third-parties for repairs. Right-to-repair advocates hope the recent regulatory attention will be the momentum needed to finally push manufacturers to make repairs accessible more broadly. For the climate, the push cant come soon enough. The worlds scientists concluded in August that it is unequivocal humans have caused the climate crisis, and confirmed that widespread and irreversible changes have already occurred. If we cant repair our stuff, the consequences are we throw a lot more away, Gay Gordon-Byrne, executive director of the Repair Association, a coalition fighting for the right to repair, told CNN. We cant cope with the volume anymore ... Were swimming in products that we can no longer recycle. The supply chain for consumer electronics is global and complex, making it hard to quantify the full scope of its environmental impact, experts say. But data that some companies make public can help paint the picture: With the iPhone 13, for example, 81% of the 64 kilograms of carbon emissions generated by a single device comes from the production process alone, before it is transported to shelves, according to Apple. On an individual scale, thats not much; its about the same as a 130-mile car trip from Los Angeles to San Diego. But multiply that by the hundreds of millions of iPhones sold each year and it adds up quickly. Then, apply a similar calculation to the countless other personal devices we use each day  laptops, desktops, tablets, smart watches, smart speakers, smart headphones and so on  and you begin to get a sense of the carbon footprint of manufacturing new consumer electronics. Everything that happens before the device reaches you is very materially and energetically intensive  thats where the most greenhouse gasses are emitted and where the most violent ecological transformation takes place, Stratton said. Some device makers have been working to increase their use of more sustainable materials in production. Apple, for example, highlighted in its recent product launch event the recycled aluminum and other repurposed components used in its new devices, and HP has talked about using plastics that might otherwise end up in the ocean to build laptops. Still, making a consumer electronic device requires the use of non-renewable, rare-Earth metals that are resource-intensive to mine and refine, and those cant easily be replaced with other components, according to Stratton. Europium and terbium, for example, are needed to make HD screens; zinc and tin help make touch-responsive surfaces; and lithium is used in batteries  just to name a few. Even with advancements in sustainable materials, not making a new device is still the most environmentally friendly option, Stratton said. Many big device makers have designed products in a way that makes them difficult to repair without specialized equipment and instructions, and have limited the authorized repair shops where customers can access such repairs without compromising their devices warranty. This has become increasingly true in recent years. Manufacturers recent design updates include the use of glue rather than screws, which can make a device smaller and lighter but also makes it harder to take apart and put back together. Apple did not respond to a request for comment for this story. During a Congressional judiciary committee hearing in 2019, Apple said it controlled the repair process over safety and reliability concerns. Device makers also say repair restrictions help protect trade secrets and consusdmer privacy. But the restrictions can also lead to profit if consumers are forced to take their broken devices to licensed shops, said Gartner analyst Aapo Markkanen. And it boosts sales if consumers must replace their devices every few years. We always had a right to repair our stuff because we paid for it, but weve just lost it as a society, Gordon-Byrne said. Advocates say these restrictions strip the public of their right to do what they want with products they own, and disadvantage small repair businesses that could be helping to preserve more old devices if they could access the proper resources. Tech Dump is an electronics recycling facility in Minnesota that also repairs and resells old devices through its store, Tech Discounts. It processes between 3 million and 4 million pounds of electronics each year, but can only fix and resell about 10% of the devices it takes in. We have brilliant technicians, and our team has figured out how to repair stuff without needing the repair manual from the manufacturer, Tech Dump CEO Amanda LaGrange told CNN. We could scale much faster, we could repair much more, if we were able to affordably access repair parts and affordably access repair manuals. The end of a products life cycle is troubling for the environment, too. Manufacturers arguing against right-to-repair often say that recycling compensates for the need to regularly replace devices. But experts say its not that simple. In 2016, Jim Puckett, the founder and executive director of the Basel Action Network, a Seattle-based electronic waste watchdog group, visited Hong Kong as part of a global investigation analyzing the end-of-life phase of devices. Puckett and a team attempted to follow the geolocating tracking devices that his organization and experts at Massachusetts Institute of Technology had put into 200 computers, printers, TVs and other devices. The team dropped them off at recyclers and donation centers across the United States that he said branded themselves as eco-friendly and sustainable and have strict control of exportation to developing countries. But Pucketts team found that roughly a third of the electronics they tracked ended up overseas, in places like Pakistan, Thailand, Mexico, the Dominican Republic and Kenya, with 87% of those devices landing in Asia, particularly rural Hong Kong. When Puckett and his team arrived at one of their first destinations in Hong Kong  which they found using the GPS coordinates on the device trackers  he said they found workers dismantling e-waste negligently. Workers broke down parts like fluorescent lights used for flat-screen TVs or monitors; once damaged, these devices release unseen mercury vapor that is toxic to public health and the environment. Chasing the end of life of electronics is really disheartening, Puckett told CNN. At the end of the whole cycle, real horror shows can take place. Even recyclers that process waste responsibly say the procedure can be difficult, because consumer electronics can contain metals and toxic chemicals, and plastics that are expensive to process, according to LaGrange. Repair advocates say that both consumers and companies should take a broader view of how we handle devices from start to finish. Manufacturers in particular should consider the harm devices and their components can cause to the environment when disposed, Puckett said. Youve got to get the toxicity out and design things to last a really long time from the get-go, Puckett said. The total mass of e-waste is declining as devices get smaller, according to a 2020 Yale study published in the Journal of Industrial Ecology. But experts worry that with the coming internet of things revolution  where everything from watches to refrigerators are becoming consumer electronic devices  the amount of waste could tick back up. The Internet of Things is terrifying to every person in my job, because were just seeing piles and piles of electronic waste coming, said LaGrange, who has been advocating for right-to-repair for nearly seven years. The fact that we are still having this conversation is surprising, she said. What was encouraging about President Bidens work ... is that weve known that repairs are important for years, theyre helpful for the people, for our planet, for local jobs, for all things digital equity. So there was something really encouraging about that being seen. But at the same time, there are still a lot of restrictions.",03/10/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/03/tech/right-to-repair-climate-environmental-impact/index.html
Google will prevent climate change deniers from making money from ads,"Google is cracking down on the ability of climate change deniers to make money off its platforms and to spread climate misinformation through advertisements. The company said Thursday it will no longer allow advertising to appear alongside content that contradicts well-established scientific consensus around the existence and causes of climate change. Google (GOOG) will also prohibit advertisements that deny the reality of climate change. The policy, which goes into effect next month, applies to any content on YouTube and other Google platforms that refers to climate change as a hoax or a scam, as well as denials that greenhouse gas emissions or human activity contribute to climate change. Weve heard directly from a growing number of our advertising and publisher partners who have expressed concerns about ads that run alongside or promote inaccurate claims about climate change, Google said in its announcement Thursday. Advertisers simply dont want their ads to appear next to this content. And publishers and creators dont want ads promoting these claims to appear on their pages or videos. Big tech companies have faced increasing pressure in recent years to contribute more to the fight against climate change, including action against climate-related misinformation on their platforms. But as some of the big platforms have shown in the past, consistently implementing a policy after it has been announced tends to be the most challenging part. Facebook last month announced its own effort to combat climate misinformation, including a $1 million grant to support fact-checking of false climate claims. Google also rolled out several products earlier this week to increase climate awareness, including a new setting in Google Maps that shows users the most eco-friendly route.",07/10/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/07/tech/google-climate-change-denial-ads/index.html
"Climate crisis is ?ingle biggest health threat facing humanity,?WHO says, calling on world leaders to act","The World Health Organization, in a new special report, is calling for governments and policymakers to act with urgency on the climate and health crises. The report describes climate change as the single biggest health threat facing humanity, and outlines 10 recommended climate and health actions along with the research in support of why each action is beneficial. Groups representing 45 million nurses, doctors and health professionals around the world have now signed an open letter to heads of state and national delegations urging action on the climate crisis, ahead of a pivotal UN climate change summit in early November. As health professionals and health workers, we recognize our ethical obligation to speak out about this rapidly growing crisis that could be far more catastrophic and enduring than the Covid-19 pandemic, the letter reads. Those people and nations who have benefited most from the activities that caused the climate crisis, especially fossil fuel extraction and use, have a great responsibility to do everything possible to help those who are now most at risk. Both the special report and open letter highlight key climate issues that are already affecting public health including air pollution from the burning of fossil fuels, which causes climate change; intensifying heat waves, floods and storms taking thousands of lives; rising sea levels destroying homes and livelihoods; and extreme weather exacerbating food insecurity and hunger. Protecting health requires action well beyond the health sector, in energy, transport, nature, food systems, finance and more, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus wrote in the reports foreword. The ten recommendations outlined in this report  and the action points, resources and case studies that support them  provide concrete examples of interventions that, with support, can be scaled up rapidly to safeguard our health and our climate. Much like the Covid-19 pandemic, the climate crisis has caused devastating ripple effects across society and the economy, threatening peoples lives, decreasing worker productivity, and straining infrastructure and health services. Moreover, the consequences of both crises have exposed the inequalities that have led certain communities to be more vulnerable than others. Even as they have been battling to end the Covid-19 pandemic, health leaders everywhere have been sounding the alarm on climate change, Maria Neira, director of the Department of Environment, Climate Change and Health at the WHO, said in a press release. It is time we listened. The landmark UN state-of-the-science report released in August concludes that the world has rapidly warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and is now barreling toward 1.5 degrees  a critical threshold that world leaders agreed warming should remain below to avoid worsening impacts. The recommendations in the new WHO special report include prioritizing climate interventions with the largest gains, building climate-resilient and environmentally sustainable health systems, and promoting sustainable food production as well as sustainable and equitable urban design and transportation systems. The recommendations are the result of extensive consultations with health professionals, organizations and stakeholders worldwide, and represent a broad consensus statement urging governments to act to tackle the climate crisis, restore biodiversity, and protect health, Tedros wrote. The report was written in memory of Ella Kissi-Debrah  and all other children who have suffered and died from air pollution and climate change. Kissi-Debrah, who died at age 9 after an asthma attack, is thought to be the first person in the world to have air pollution listed as a cause of death in a landmark coroners ruling. Kissi-Debrah lived in southeast London, near one of the UK capitals busiest roads, the South Circular. As world leaders prepare for this years UN climate talks, health care leaders are urging heads of states to expand their international climate commitments to tackle the current public health crises brought by a warming world  and to prevent future ones. The health arguments for rapid climate action have never been clearer, Tedros wrote. I hope this report can guide policymakers and practitioners from across sectors and across the world to implement the transformative changes needed.",11/10/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/11/health/climate-change-health-covid-who/index.html
"Scientists looked at more than 100,000 studies and found the world has a giant climate-crisis blind spot","Scientists using artificial intelligence to sift through around 100,000 climate studies were trying to put a number on how many people in the world were already experiencing the impacts of the climate crisis. Instead, they discovered something else: there is a worrying inequality in the world of climate science. Climate change studies are twice as likely to focus on wealthier countries in Europe and North America than low-income countries like those in Africa and the Pacific Islands. That blind spot is a problem, as the Global South is and will continue to be more profoundly impacted by the climate crisis than wealthier countries. The ability to link the climate crisis to real-world impacts has grown dramatically in the past decade, as more people face the consequences of a warming planet, including deadly floods, destructive wildfires and crippling heat. But it has been a challenge to collect and scrutinize the vast amount of research, to fully understand the global impact. In research published in the journal Nature Climate Change on Monday, scientists used machine learning  training computer algorithms to detect patterns and predict outcomes  to analyze more than 100,000 climate change studies. Theres just so much climate science produced, like tens of thousands [of studies], and getting to grips with this evidence is really difficult, Max Callaghan, lead author of the study and a researcher at the Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change, told CNN. So we trained the machine learning algorithm to predict the areas that we didnt have time to look at  which is most of them. Compiling the results of all of those studies would suggest a vast majority of the world  80% of land area, where 85% of the worlds population lives  is experiencing the effects of the climate crisis right now. Its a large percentage, but experts know the true number is even higher. The authors called the blind spot in research an attribution gap. Callaghan said the gap suggests 85% is likely to be an underestimate. Friederike Otto, co-lead of the World Weather Attribution initiative, who was not involved with the machine-learning research, also said the studys estimate is likely too low. Over the years, climate scientists like Otto have been saying the climate crisis will leave no place in the world untouched. The study focused on changes in mean temperature and precipitation, rather than extremes, but we know that heat extremes are changing faster than mean temperatures and that heat extremes are increasing almost everywhere, Otto told CNN. It is likely that nearly everyone in the world now experiences changes in extreme weather as a result of human greenhouse gas emissions. What we find here is that the evidence is distributed unequally across countries, Callaghan said. And this is really important because often when we try to make a map or to find out where the impacts of climate change are happening, we find often few scientific papers in less developed countries or low-income countries. Callaghan added that this attribution gap leaves people wondering if climate change is happening in those areas, even though climate scientists firmly believe so. We want to try and point out that absence of evidence isnt evidence of absence, he said. The authors note in the study that an automated approach is no substitute for careful assessment by experts, however, it can identify large numbers of studies for a region that may point towards consequences brought by human-caused climate change. Tom Knutson, senior scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and co-author of the study, told CNN the machine learning methodology has a number of limitations and weaknesses, since it only accounts for certain climate impacts  in this case, human-induced precipitation and temperature changes. If it accounted for other impacts such as sea level rise, for example, he said the outcome may have suggested a greater fraction of the worlds population has been experiencing climate change. A recent report by the World Meteorological Organization found that an extreme weather event or climate disaster has occurred every day, on average, somewhere in the world over the last 50 years, marking a five-fold increase over that period. This summer alone was packed with extreme weather events across the Northern Hemisphere: While the United States has been battered by a cocktail of drought-fueled wildfires, devastating floods and a historic heat wave, China and Germany experienced deadly flooding events in July as southern Europe and Canada battled destructive wildfires of its own. Despite the observed extremes, the dearth of substantial scientific evidence has the effect of limiting the changes that can be proposed or implemented in under-studied locations, Callaghan said. Its useful to bring together the literature and data as this study has, which allows us to see where more data is needed and where there are gaps, Otto said, pointing to previous studies. Their finding of a gap in the Global South is similar to what we found last year, where we saw that extreme events are identified less often and are the subject of fewer attribution studies when they occur in poorer countries. World leaders will gather at a critical UN climate meeting in less than a month, and one of the issues that will be discussed is the amount of funding developed nations can pledge to help the Global South move away from fossil fuels and manage the impacts of the climate crisis. Callaghan said this new machine learning research delivers a key message for world leaders: Climate change is already happening and the planet will only continue to warm, meaning adaptation is critical as well as halting the use of fossil fuels. The new study provides an outline of where more climate funds and climate research are needed, and it is up to global leaders to implement that. The world will continue to warm until we stop burning fossil fuels, and there is simply no way around that, he said. And what we really need to recognize is that we need to change the trajectory and reduce emissions.",11/10/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/11/world/climate-change-attribution-gap/index.html
Our underwater future: What sea level rise will look like around the globe,"The planet is warming rapidly, resulting in historic drought, deadly floods and unusual melting events in the Arctic. It is also causing steady sea level rise, which scientists say will continue for decades. A new study from Climate Central, a nonprofit research group, shows that roughly 50 major coastal cities will need to implement unprecedented adaptation measures to prevent rising seas from swallowing their most populated areas. The analysis, in collaboration with researchers at Princeton University and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, resulted in striking visual contrasts between the world as we know it today and our underwater future, if the planet warms to 3 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Climate scientists reported in August the world is already around 1.2 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial levels. Temperatures should stay below 1.5 degrees, they say  a critical threshold to avoid the most severe impacts of the climate crisis. But even in the most optimistic scenario, where global greenhouse gas emissions begin to decline today and are slashed to net zero by 2050, global temperature will still peak above the 1.5-degree threshold before falling. In less-optimistic scenarios, where emissions continue to climb beyond 2050, the planet could reach 3 degrees as early as the 2060s or 2070s, and the oceans will continue to rise for decades beyond that before they reach peak levels. Todays choices will set our path, said Benjamin Strauss, the chief scientist at Climate Central and lead author on the report. Climate Central researchers used global elevation and population data to analyze parts of the world that will be most vulnerable to sea level rise, which tend to be concentrated in the Asia-Pacific region. Small island nations at risk of near-total loss of land, the report says, and eight of the top 10 areas exposed to sea level rise are in Asia, with approximately 600 million people exposed to inundation under a 3-degree warming scenario. According to Climate Centrals analysis, China, India, Vietnam, and Indonesia are in the top five countries most vulnerable to long-term sea level rise. The researchers note that these are also countries that have added additional coal-burning capacity in recent years. In September, a study published in the journal Nature found nearly 60% of the planets remaining oil and natural gas and 90% of its coal reserves should remain in the ground by 2050 to have a higher chance of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Most regions around the world, it said, must reach peak fossil fuel production now or within the next decade to avoid the critical climate threshold. At the UN General Assembly in September, China made a major climate pledge as one of the worlds largest emitters of greenhouse gases: the country will no longer build any new coal-fired power projects abroad, marking a shift in policy around its sprawling Belt and Road infrastructure initiative, which had already begun to dwindle its coal initiatives. If the planet hits 3 degrees, Climate Central reports that roughly 43 million people in China will live on land projected to be below high-tide levels by 2100, with 200 million people living in areas at risk of sea level rise over the longer term. With every fraction of a degree of warming, the consequences of climate change worsen. Even limiting warming to 1.5 degrees, scientists say the kinds of extreme weather the world experienced this summer will become more severe and more frequent. Beyond 1.5 degrees, the climate system could begin to look unrecognizable. According to the Climate Central report, roughly 385 million people currently live on land that will eventually be inundated by high tide, even if greenhouse gas emissions are reduced. If warming is limited to 1.5 degrees, sea level rise would affect land inhabited by 510 million people today. If the planet reaches 3 degrees, the high-tide line could encroach above land where more than 800 million people live, the study finds. The authors note in the report that a key caveat in their assessment is the lack of global data on existing coastal defenses such as levees and seawalls to fully project exposure to rising seas. Nonetheless, they recognize that because of the impacts seen today with recent flooding events and storm surges, cities will likely revamp infrastructure to avoid worsening impacts. Higher levels of warming will require globally unprecedented defenses or abandonment in scores of major coastal cities worldwide, the authors wrote, whereas the count could be limited to a relative handful through strong compliance with the Paris Agreement, especially limiting warming to 1.5 degrees. But coastal infrastructure costs money. Wealthy nations like the United States and the United Kingdom could afford these measures, but low-income nations could be left behind. And while many small island nations are surrounded by mangroves and coral reefs that could protect their lands from rising seas, warming temperatures are causing ocean acidification and other forms of environmental destruction that threaten such defense measures. During the first two weeks of November, world leaders will gather at UN-brokered climate talks in Glasgow, Scotland. They will discuss further limiting greenhouse gas emissions, as well as the amount of funding developed nations will pledge to help the Global South move away from fossil fuels and adapt to the impacts of the climate crisis. Unless bold and rapid actions are taken, extreme weather events and climate change-fueled sea level rise will increasingly fill the future of the Earth. Scientists say the planet is running out of time to avoid these worst-case scenarios. World leaders have a fleeting opportunity to help or betray the future of humanity with their actions today on climate change, said Strauss. This research and the images created from it illustrate the enormous stakes behind the climate talks in Glasgow.",12/10/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/12/world/3-degrees-sea-level-rise-climate-central/index.html
This website helps you imagine what extreme climate change will do to your home,"The other day I found myself looking at a startling image of my Northern California home, the daylight dampened by an eerie orange glow as wildfire smoke blocked the sun. It looked exactly as it had on September 9, 2020, when the entire San Francisco Bay Area was shrouded in orange smoke  a scary scene I hoped Id never see again. But this time the disturbing sight was generated by a new website with the help of artificial intelligence. The goal: to draw attention to the perils of our changing environment, and inspire people to take action against it, by showing how climate disasters would look in our own backyards. On ThisClimateDoesNotExist.com you can look up any address  your house, landmarks like the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, Times Square in New York or San Franciscos Painted Ladies homes  and get a surprisingly realistic sense of what it could look like if that place was struck by flood, wildfires or smog. The website, which does this by using AI trained on images of such scenes to re-imagine pictures from Google Street View, was created by researchers at Mila, an AI research institute in Montreal. The website, which was unveiled Thursday, has been in the works for two years. It began with the realization that while we have tools to face climate change, an enormous obstacle to dealing with it is public awareness and political will, said Yoshua Bengio, a professor at the University of Montreal and founder of Mila, who also led the research team for the project. Bengio, a Turing Award winner, said the researchers wanted to create images that felt personal, which led to the idea of using AI to show what your house might look like during an environmental catastrophe. Citizens in the past have been hearing about climate change coming from scientists, reports, and graphs, Bengio said. And there is a cognitive aspect, which is, something doesnt scare us so much if its not right in front of our eyes. Climate scientists reported in August the world is already around 1.2 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial levels. Temperatures should stay below 1.5 degrees, they say  a critical threshold to avoid the most severe impacts of the climate crisis. With every fraction of a degree of warming, the consequences of climate change worsen. Even limiting warming to 1.5 degrees, scientists say the kinds of extreme weather the world experienced this summer, including flash floods and more devastating hurricanes, will become more severe and more frequent. ThisClimateDoesNotExist can show you such images that make your home or, say, the Leaning Tower of Pisa appear to be truly flooded or covered in smoke or smog. But creating these visuals isnt as simple as placing an image of water in front of a building or adding a diaphanous filter. There arent many pairs of images out there showing homes before and after a flood  the kind of data that would be helpful for training an AI system on the relationship between the image its being fed and what it should turn it into. To compensate for this, researchers started by building a computerized virtual world. This world, the equivalent of several blocks of a city, let them control flooding and other elements so they could create synthetic images of places before and after a climate catastrophe, said Sasha Luccioni, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Montreal and Mila and a lead researcher on the project. This synthetic data, along with real images showing flooded houses and pictures of smokey orange skies and smog, was used to train an AI system to take any given image from Google Street View and make it look like a climate catastrophe was at hand. To do this, the system needed to first learn where, for instance, water should go in a given image, and then essentially paint water in a realistic-looking way, including reflections of objects poking out of the water and considerations for the lighting of the image. After a user types in an address and ThisClimateDoesNotExist generates images, the website encourages the user to share them with others and presents resources to learn more about climate change and fight it. I think what we want is to channel that initial, like, Oh man, my house is underwater, into climate action, Luccioni said.",14/10/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/14/tech/ai-envisions-climate-change/index.html
What does ?et zero?mean? Our climate change glossary will help you sound smart,"The whole world seems to be talking about the climate crisis, thanks to months of wild weather and new science showing that we need to act quicker than we previously thought to avoid the worst consequences. As leaders prepare to meet in Glasgow, Scotland, next month for crunch talks, theyll be using a lot of technical lingo. The terminology isnt particularly communicative and can be daunting. Even the name of the summit  COP26  sounds more like a bad police drama than a climate event. (First pointer: COP is short for Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on Climate Change. It convenes global leaders, scientists and negotiators on climate, and usually takes place annually. The 26 means Glasgow will be the 26th meeting.) Here are other terms to know to keep up with the talks, understand whats at stake and, most importantly, sound smart around the dinner table. Net zero emissions can be achieved by removing as much greenhouse gas from the atmosphere as whats emitted, so the net amount added is zero. To do this, countries and companies will need to rely on natural methods  like planting trees or restoring grasslands  to soak up carbon dioxide (CO2), the most abundant greenhouse gas we emit, or use technology to capture the gas and store it away where it wont escape into the atmosphere. Dozens of countries have already pledged to achieve net zero by mid-century and there is huge pressure on countries that havent yet to do so by COP26. To save the world from the worst effects of climate change, scientists say its probably not enough to reach net zero. Net negative emissions is the situation where the amount of greenhouse gas removed from the atmosphere is actually more than the amount humans emit at a given period of time. This is a reservoir that absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and locks it away. Natural sinks like trees and other vegetation remove CO2 from the atmosphere through photosynthesis  plants use the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to grow. The ocean is also a major carbon sink because of phytoplankton which, as a plant, also absorbs carbon dioxide. Scientists say preservation and expansion of natural sinks such as forests are crucial to reducing emissions. There are also artificial carbon sinks that can store carbon and keep it out of the atmosphere. More on that below. Technology to remove and contain carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is known as carbon capture and storage. Carbon is usually captured at source  directly from coal, oil or gas as it burns  but new technology is being developed to literally suck carbon from the air. In both cases, the carbon can be stored, usually buried in reservoirs underground or below the floor of the sea, in what are known as artificial carbon sinks. Some scientists warn that it could be risky to inject so much carbon underground, and this process isnt currently used on a large scale. The Global CCS Institute says just 27 commercial facilities are fully operating worldwide, while more than 100 others are in development. But other experts say CCS is necessary to put a real dent in our emissions. There are many ways to capture and store carbon. Here are some of them: Nationally Determined Contributions  or NDCs  is a term used by the UN for each countrys individual national plan to slash greenhouse gas emissions. In the 2015 Paris Agreement, which nearly the whole world signed on to, countries were given the freedom to determine themselves how they would go about meeting the agreements key targets to slow global warming. NDCs are supposed to be updated every five years and submitted to the UN, the idea being that each countrys ambition will grow over time. Dozens of countries have failed to submit their updates ahead of COP26. This usually refers to average concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere before the Industrial Revolution, which started in the late 18th century. CO2 levels are estimated to have been around 280 parts per million at that time. By 2020, that concentration had risen to 412.5 parts per million, according to US government figures. Scientists also talk about pre-industrial levels for average temperatures, using the period 1850-1900 to determine how hot or cold the Earth was before humans began emitting greenhouse gases at larger volumes, like those we see today. A key goal of COP26 President Alok Sharma, a British MP, is keeping 1.5 alive, which refers to a target to keep average global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Its a target that some fossil fuel-producing countries have resisted, and scientists have warned of significantly worse impacts if this threshold is breached. The countries that signed the Paris Agreement in 2015 agreed to limit the increase in global temperatures to well below 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels, but preferably to 1.5 degrees. However, an analysis released last month by watchdog Climate Action Tracker (CAT) found that not a single major economy  including the entire G20  had a climate plan that meets its obligations under Paris. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said in its latest state-of-the-science report that the world has already warmed by 1.1 degrees above than pre-industrial levels, and is now hurtling fast toward 1.5 degrees. More than 10 years ago, at COP16 in Cancun, Mexico, the developed world agreed to transfer money to developing countries to help them limit or reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the climate crisis. They set up the Green Climate Fund (GCF) to facilitate some of this transfer, but countries and donors can send money through any means they like. The money was supposed to build up and reach $100 billion annually by 2020, and that commitment was reaffirmed in the Paris Agreement. This money is often referred to broadly as climate finance. But the 2020 target was missed, and filling the gap is high on the agenda for the talks in Glasgow. Developing nations, particularly those in the Global South, which are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, argue that industrialized nations are historically more responsible for climate change and must do more to fund changes to help developing nations adapt. US President Joe Biden pledged to double the US existing contribution plans, including money for the Green Climate Fund, in a speech at the UN General Assembly in September. Some critics say he should pledge more to make up for the Trump years, when no money was paid into the fund. Adaptation refers to the way humans can change their lives to better cope with the impacts of climate change. These might include building early warning systems for floods or barriers to defend against rising sea levels, for example. In some places where rainfall is decreasing, planting drought-resistant varieties of crops can help ensure communities have enough food to eat. Put simply, this refers to how humans can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, or remove them from the atmosphere, to ease the consequences of climate change. Examples include using fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas more efficiently for industrial processes, switching from coal and gas to renewable energy sources such as wind or solar power for electricity, choosing public transport to commute over private vehicles that run on gasoline, and expanding forests and other means of absorbing carbon. You might hear leaders talking about the end of unabated coal. Unabated coal refers to coal burned in power stations where no action  or abatement  is taken to reduce the greenhouse gases emitted by its use. In short, this creates a loophole for some continued coal power in a net zero world, if the greenhouse gases it emits are captured. Very few coal plants in the world, however, are using abatement technologies, and transitioning to renewables is often more economically feasible in the long term than employing them. In its 2021 report Net Zero by 2050, the International Energy Agency states that a rapid shift will be needed away from fossil fuels to achieve the goal, requiring steps such as phasing out all unabated coal and oil power plants by 2040. Thats electric vehicles to you and me. As electricity generated by renewables, like wind and solar, becomes more available, people are expected to start buying electric vehicles in greater numbers, especially as they become more affordable. That will mean fewer cars powered by oil on the roads, which is another topic on the agenda for COP26. There may also be references to PHEVs  those are plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, which are mostly powered by a battery charged from an electrical source but also have a hybrid internal combustion engine to allow travel over longer distances. This refers to the idea that the drastic changes needed to combat climate change should be fair to everyone. As environmental campaign group Greenpeace says: Put simply, a just transition is about moving to an environmentally sustainable economy (thats the transition part) without leaving workers in polluting industries behind. It aims to support good quality jobs and decent livelihoods when polluting industries decline and others expand, creating a fairer and more equal society  thats what makes it just. Biodiversity refers to all the Earths living systems, on land and in the sea. The UNs Global Biodiversity Outlook report published just over a year ago warned that the accelerating climate crisis was worsening the outlook for biodiversity  that can mean all the trees, plants and animals in a forest, or all the fish and coral in a reef. Biodiversity is declining at an unprecedented rate, and the pressures driving this decline are intensifying, it said. Challenges include habitat loss and degradation, mass extinction of species, declining wetlands, and pollution by plastic and pesticides. Earlier this year, the G7 countries  the seven largest advanced economies  agreed to conserve 30% of land and sea in their nations to protect biodiversity, a pledge they hope will be adopted by more countries at COP26. At COP24 in 2018, world leaders agreed to come up with a set of rules meant to help curb global warming  the so-called Paris Rulebook  which is supposed to put into motion the Paris Agreement. But they did not resolve a critical but complicated issue involving how countries trade and account for certain types of pollution. COP26 President Sharma has been showing more frustration recently that six years after Paris, the rulebook is still unfinished. This must be resolved if we are to unleash the full power of the Paris Agreement, he said earlier in October. COP26 organizers say the rulebook priorities are to: find a solution on carbon markets by creating a robust system of carbon credits; resolve issues around transparency, by putting in place a system that encourages all countries to keep their commitments; and to broker an agreement that drives ambition from governments to meet the 1.5-degree goal.",15/10/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/15/world/climate-cop26-glossary-explainer-cmd-intl/index.html
What? driving Manchin? resistance to climate change legislation,"West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin  a Democrat  appears to be intent on ripping the heart out of President Joe Bidens climate change agenda. With his all-powerful 50th vote as leverage, Manchins reported opposition to Bidens plan for a $150 billion plan to pay power generators to further cut reliance on fossil fuels, kills the plan. It wouldnt be the first time hes committed violence on legislation to address climate change. Back in 2010, when he won as a Democrat in a red state in a very red year, Manchin did it by running an ad in which he literally fired a bullet into climate change legislation. That legislation, the last major attempt to enact climate change legislation, did fail. Eleven years later, the effects of the climate crisis are all the more apparent and frightening but Manchin is still out to get climate change legislation he thinks will hurt his state. It could also hurt him. His familys wealth is directly tied to coal. RELATED: Gas prices are high. That could mess with Bidens climate agenda Years later, hes a man specifically made for this moment. The Democrat representing a red state, hes got complete power over legislation. The chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee only amplifies his importance on energy and climate issues. The current proposal he killed would have paid utilities for moving more quickly away from fossil fuels. Manchin opposes moving more quickly away from fossil fuels since he says the US is already moving away from fossil fuels. Hes right. But its not happening fast enough. Time is running out. Experts are convinced the window is closing for the US and other countries to address climate change, which is already wreaking havoc on the weather and supercharging natural disasters, before the effects are catastrophic. RELATED: Coal-fired power is on the rise in America for the first time since 2014 One new study published in Nature suggests that to in order to avoid catastrophic consequences, most of the worlds remaining fossil fuels should remain in the ground. Ive been trying to see this from Manchins perspective. Hes like a politician from another time  when there were Democrats representing red states. Hes sticking up for the energy source of another time  when coal was king. He doesnt see the need for the government to hasten the demise of coal since coals demise is here. The transitions already happening, Manchin told CNN, although he would not comment on a story about coal and West Virginia. So Im not going to sit back and let anyone accelerate whatever the markets changes are doing. West Virginians are feeling the effects of climate change and the energy markets. Coal is part of West Virginias entire identity. Its beneath the ground in all but two West Virginia counties. It was discovered in the state in the 1700s, part of a great legacy of energy production. Its still the No. 2 coal producer in the US, behind Wyoming. But the US has transitioned away from coal and so too has West Virginia, although more slowly. Most US coal comes from five states, according to the US Energy Information Agency: Even in most states where coal is produced, its production has been dropping, including in West Virginia. The number of people employed in the coal industry in Appalachia, which includes West Virginia, has dropped by half from about 60,000 in 2011 to less than 30,000 today. Coal used to be the largest energy source in the US. Now it accounts for less than 20% of US electricity generation. Thats a smaller portion of the US electricity market than either nuclear or renewable energy. As coal has dwindled, natural gas has exploded. Back in 2008, nearly twice as much US electricity was generated by coal compared to natural gas. In 2020, natural gas generated more than twice the electricity of coal. West Virginia is also a major producer of natural gas. It sits on the Marcellus Shale, which has massive amounts of potential natural gas and is in the top five natural gas producing states, along with Texas, Pennsylvania, Louisiana and Oklahoma. Coal production is actually up this year. That said, coal is experiencing a likely short-term production bump  the first since 2014  since the price of natural gas has exploded as part of a worldwide energy crunch. Where does your electricity come from? I spent some interesting time today looking at where electricity comes from in different states. You can search by zip code. My region, which includes Virginia and the Carolinas, was (and Im rounding here): For comparison, West Virginia gets 89% of its electricity from coal. House of cards. Some Democrats are now questioning that still-large infrastructure bill if it lacks that climate provision Manchin has killed. Others are casting about for an alternative to help the US meet its goal of cutting carbon-producing energy production in half by 2030. What are the alternatives? A tax on carbon, more direct than the one Democrats tried to enact in 2010, could be the next order of business. It has the benefit of being the most direct way to cut carbon emissions, but the problem is no lawmaker likes to raise taxes. Itd be a difficult sell for any lawmaker, in particular Manchin. West Virginia voters elected him to put a bullet in it.",19/10/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/19/politics/climate-change-manchin-what-matters/index.html
"In an age of self-interest, Boris Johnson? secret COP26 weapon may have to be shame","Its now less than two weeks until Boris Johnson welcomes the world to Glasgow, Scotland, where he will host the COP26 international climate talks at a crucial moment in our planets history. Over the course of a fortnight, the British Prime Minister hopes he can shepherd some of the most powerful leaders on Earth to accelerate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions over this decade. Its impossible to overstate how important this summit is for Johnsons image internationally. He has claimed, ever since the UK voted to leave the European Union, that Brexit was an opportunity for his country to become a more active member of the global community, leading the way in reforming global trade, the international rules-based order and tackling the climate crisis. For COP26 to be considered a success, Johnson and Alok Sharma, his COP26 President, will need to see delegates commit to limiting global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrialization temperatures, as opposed to the 2C upper limit stated in the 2015 Paris Agreement. Hell also want dozens more pledges for net zero  where countries emit no more greenhouse gases than they remove from the atmosphere  which realistically requires halving emissions globally by 2030. Of particular importance will be commitments from countries who are growing their economies off the back of fossil fuels, such as Saudi Arabia, and China, which is using coal to power its pandemic comeback. On top of that, he is hoping rich countries will also honor their commitment to transfer $100 billion annually to the Global South to help countries there deal with the crisis they had little hand in creating. Putting an end date on burning coal, boosting plans on electric vehicles and finalizing the Paris Agreement rulebook  which is still not finished six years after the landmark deal was struck  would also mean success. Given the severity of the climate crisis, one might assume that agreement on these issues would be simple. Unfortunately, politics and science have a complicated relationship with one another and, in 2021, multilateralism relies as much on political self-interest as it does on indisputable facts. When it comes to climate policy, politics and physics are having an argument that physics will win, says Tom Burke, chair of E3G, an independent climate think tank. Politics will always favor short-term arguments about short-term cost of living and energy security, whereas physics will obey its laws, paying no attention to cost or time. Until the politics conversation is more realistic about what needs to be done to transform our economies  which will actually provide more economic opportunity  this losing argument will continue. Burke believes that the only way a successful climate policy can be achieved is by countries pooling their sovereignty  as happened with the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe after World War II, for instance  so that every country is as invested as the next. However, he says that as the memory of that war fades, people are forgetting that the global Western order was formed to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past. There are few willing to make a case to their electorate for pooling sovereignty, Burke said, in the face of domestic political issues that matter to voters more than issues in the wider world. A good example of this is the current energy shortages hiking consumer prices. Beyond concerns about individuals heating their homes, some analysts also believe that powerful nations have become more insular over the past decade or so. After the Cold War, the argument for internationalism was easy to make, as people could see the benefits of cheaper goods and greater work opportunities, Alexander Stubb, former prime minister and foreign minister of Finland, told CNN. After the financial crash, many believed that it was the same globalism that had cost them their jobs, homes and prosperity. This fear and anger at the wider world breeds the sort of grievance politics that can lead to isolationism. While Brexit was about more than Britain raising the drawbridge, it is undeniable that a large chunk of the vote came from people who felt left behind and failed by a modern, open world in which they saw no place for themselves. Donald Trumps victory in America the same year was again more complicated than any single issue, but his isolationist America First politics fed a resentment towards globalization and US troops dying in foreign lands. So successful was Trump in feeding this beast, his successor adopted many Trumpian foreign policy stances in places like Afghanistan and China. In this age of self-interest, is there hope that multilateralism could return to save the planet? Stubb says that appealing to the self-interest of the populous is a good starting point. You need to make people feel they are living better lives, be it they are richer or more comfortable because of globalization, he says. That can be because of greater choice in things they buy or because of jobs and subsequent wealth brought to their areas through regeneration projects. Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations and author of the book The Age of Unpeace: How Connectivity Causes Conflict, explains that going green can be spun not just to citizens, but governments, as serving their own national interest. The trick is to make these things beneficial for the countrys national affairs. They can either be in control of their energy revolution or watch other countries steal the march on them. They could also find their economies less competitive in coming years. He acknowledges that this is hard, particularly in the current political climate that surrounds COP. Science has been undermined by so many national leaders over the past year, he says, adding that collective responsibility on issues has been replaced by powerful countries doing what they want while smaller countries suffer, something that can clearly be seen in the distribution of Covid-19 vaccines, for example. Leonard does see a silver lining on selling climate change to even the most cynical of leaders, however. Quitting carbon can put some in a strong position as it decreases their dependence on others. They could make money out of it by being the first to a new technology. It is possible that good things can come out of naked self-interest. In an absence of altruism, Johnson could appeal to his fellow leaders sense of shame. Shame is a powerful tool, which played a central role in the success of the Paris Agreement six years ago. Mary Robinson, a former UN High Representative on human rights and campaigner for climate justice, says that the success in Paris could not have been achieved without one person. In 2015, ahead of the Paris summit, Tony deBrum, then foreign minister of the Marshall Islands, asked his counterparts why his country should disappear simply because they refused to cut their carbon emissions by 1.5C. Among all the boring speeches and statements, he stood out by simply asking why the others believed his country should be consumed by the ocean. It was so powerful that we elevated his voice in Paris. We marched in the streets under the mantra 1.5 to stay alive and forced a conversation about the difference between 1.5C and 2C, she says. I dont believe we would have got there without him. COP26 is a huge moment for the world, but also Johnson personally. Even in his own country, there is criticism of his climate plans, which are arguably the most ambitious of any major economy. Prominent members of his own Conservative party are demanding to know exactly how he plans to pay for them and are viewing the financial cost as more important than the environmental. Convincing less-wealthy countries that are growing their economies to not burn fossil fuels in the same way the UK and its Western allies have over the past century really is a tall order. There is a narrow path out this mess: If the worlds richest agree to fund the rest going green and can argue the case for doing so to their domestic audience, there is hope. However, it will require a combination of arm-twisting, shaming, and making uncomfortable compromises with countries like China and Saudi Arabia that are commonplace in modern diplomacy. Ahead of COP26, we are presented with a bizarre prospect. It is entirely possible to fix the climate crisis. All it should require is for the people who live in the world to want to save it. Yet in 2021, consensus on climate will only come if Johnson can convince those in power that theyll be better off than their rivals.",19/10/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/19/uk/boris-johnson-cop26-globalism-intl-cmd/index.html
Report warns of climate change? ?ode red?impact on health,"A new report published Wednesday warns of the severe impact of climate change on human health, and says the prognosis is only getting worse. Droughts will hurt food production, rising temperatures will encourage the spread of dangerous pathogens such as malaria and cholera and current climate trends indicate a code red for future health, the new report in The Lancet medical journal predicts. The Lancet Countdown report, published annually, tracks 44 metrics of the health impacts of climate change, including the impact of climate change on infectious disease transmission and food production, as researched by experts affiliated with more than 40 UN groups and educational institutions. The report said during a 6 month period in 2020, 51.6 million people were impacted by 84 disasters from floods, droughts, and storms in countries already struggling with the coronavirus pandemic. The 2021 report of the Lancet Countdown finds a world overwhelmed by an ongoing global health crisis, which has made little progress to protect its population from the simultaneously aggravated health impacts of climate change, the report authors wrote. Climate impacts on health identified in the report included increased droughts hurting food production, more violent natural disasters placing burdens on health care systems, and rising temperatures encouraging the spread of infectious pathogens. The report said climate change contributed to a record-breaking heatwave in the US Pacific Northwest that caused more than 1,000 deaths. Looking to 2021, people older than 65 years or younger than 1 year, along with people facing social disadvantages, were the most affected by the record-breaking temperatures of over 40C in the Pacific Northwest areas of the USA and Canada in June, 2021 an event that would have been almost impossible without human-caused climate change, the authors wrote. Dr. Jeremy Hess, a global health and emergency medicine professor at the University of Washington and a co-author on the report, said in a media briefing that he has seen some of these health effects firsthand. I was taking care of patients in two of our hospitals out here in Seattle during the heat dome and unfortunately this was the first year I can say confidently that I and my patients very clearly experienced the impacts of climate change. I saw paramedics who had burns on their knees from kneeling down to care for patients with heatstroke. And I saw far too many patients die in the ED as a result of their heat exposure this past year, Hess said. According to the report, rising temperatures have resulted in an increase in the number of months where malaria is transmissible since the 1950s, and an increase in the number of areas suitable for cholera transmission. The epidemic potential of viruses including dengue and Zika increased globally. Together with global mobility and urbanization, climate change is a major driver of the increase in the number of dengue virus infections, which have doubled every decade since 1990, the reports authors write. Other important emerging or re-emerging arboviruses, transmitted by mosquitoes, are likely to have a similar response to climate change. Hess said global recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic could worsen an already dire situation, particularly if it is not a green recovery. The world has invested tremendous resources in recovery, but not taken the opportunity to invest those resources in a green recovery that isnt fueled by fossil fuels. And this unfortunately is a lost opportunity for us. We could be investing in a healthier future, and as of right now, and of course this is a pivotal moment in politics in the United States and globally, related to climate change, we need to seize that opportunity, Hess said. Released ahead of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change 26th Conference of the Parties, the report highlights the importance of global climate action, like the Paris Agreement, on global health. Neither Covid-19 nor climate change respect national borders. Without widespread, accessible vaccination across all countries and societies, Sars-CoV-2 and its new variants will continue to put the health of everybody at risk. Likewise, tackling climate change requires all countries to deliver an urgent and coordinated response, with Covid-19 recovery funds allocated to support and ensure a just transition to a low-carbon future and climate change adaptation across the globe, report authors said. By directing the trillions of dollars that will be committed to Covid-19 recovery towards the WHOs prescriptions for a healthy, green recovery, the world could meet the Paris Agreement goals, protect the natural systems that support well-being, and minimize inequities through reduced health effects and maximized co-benefits of a universal low-carbon transition. Every fraction of a degree matters for health inequity and the US has an opportunity to make the urgent sweeping actions that we need to protect health, Dr. Renee Salas, an assistant professor of emergency medicine at Harvard Medical School who contributed to the report, told CNN. Climate change is first and foremost a health crisis that is unfolding right now and as an emergency medicine doctor I took an oath to protect the health of my patients, and I cant do that without action (on) climate change. So, improving health and accelerating equity, must not only be the reason we act, but it also has to guide how we respond Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, who did not contribute to the report, told the briefing the pandemic offers a way to better prepare for climate change as a health crisis on a global scale. Weve just spent many years preparing and talking about a pandemic, and quite frankly, we were not prepared. We did not put the infrastructure in place that we actually needed to put in place. We de-invested in ... our health and public health systems in ways that quite tragically resulted in two years of significant outbreak that did not have to be as bad as it was, he said. The real issue here is that were about to do the same mistake again. Were about to have the same things happen to us because we have not really invested in the mitigation and adaptation that is necessary to address climate change. In an editorial released with the report referenced research on what has made societies resilient against climate issues in the past. These pathways are: exploiting new opportunities, developing resilient energy systems, utilizing trade and resources, forging political and institutional adaptations, and migration and transformation, the editorial authors wrote. The key message is that the world needs a new era of research that is less focused on forecasts for climate change, and more on predictions of the societal consequences of future warming and how to weather them. Succumbing to the climate emergency is not inevitable.",20/10/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/20/health/climate-change-health-covid-19/index.html
"?o country will be spared?from effects of climate change, Biden administration reports detail","A series of new reports from the Biden administration will issue a stark warning on Thursday: The effects of climate change will be wide-reaching and will pose problems for every government. No country will be spared from the challenges directly related to climate change, a senior administration official told reporters in a call previewing the reports. The four reports  which President Joe Biden called for in executive orders in January and February  not only analyze issues currently being made worse by climate change, they examine future threats facing the United States. The release includes a report on migration, a National Intelligence Estimate, and separate reports from the Defense Department and the Department of Homeland Security. The reports come 10 days before the President is scheduled to attend the international climate conference known as COP 26 in Glasgow, Scotland. These analyses will serve as a foundation for critical work on climate and security moving forward, a senior administration official told reporters during a call Wednesday evening, on the condition of not being named. Its important to flag that these analyses reinforce the Presidents commitment to the United States making evidence-based decisions, guided by the best available science and data. Among the reports, which were released later Thursday morning, the administration details how climate change is driving migration, the first time the US government is officially recognizing the link between climate change and migration. It identifies migration as an important form of adaptation to the impact of climate change, and in some cases an essential response to climate threat, the official explained. That threat will cause people to move to the nearest stable democracies that adhere to international asylum conventions and are strong economies, they added. In many cases, that will mean US allies or partner countries that have already experienced climate-related influxes of migration, and are vulnerable to greater insecurity, such as Greece, Turkey, the United Kingdom and France. The official noted that the administration was very careful not to frame migration as a purely negative coping mechanism. Our goals remain to ensure that migration for any reason is done in a safe, orderly and humane pathway, the official said. Asked about migration from Central America in particular  which has been straining US resources as waves of migrants show up at the countrys southern border  the official said they would let the report speak for itself. The migration report does talk about different countries and regions that are affected by climate migration and includes countries within the Western Hemisphere, and what we can do along those lines as well, they said, declining to get into specifics. The White House will also release a National Intelligence Estimate  an authoritative assessment that represents a consensus view of all 18 intelligence agencies  that provides a geopolitical analysis of the implications and risks to the United States posed by climate change. Climate change will increasingly exacerbate a number of risks to US national security interests from both physical impacts that could cascade into security challenges, to help countries respond to the climate challenge, the senior official said. The broad categories of risk will include increased geopolitical tension, cross-border geopolitical flashpoints as countries take steps to secure their interests, and the risk that climate change will destabilize countries internally. The Intelligence Committee judges all of these risks will increase, and that no country will be spared from the challenges directly related to climate change, the official said. Another report from the Department of Defense will focus on the strategic and mission implications of climate change. The official said it provides a starting point for how the Defense Department will tackle climate change and the effects it will have, laying out a path forward. Both climate change threats and the global efforts to address climate change will influence US defense, strategic interests, relationships, competition and priorities, the official told reporters, adding that the report identifies security implications of climate change for DoD at the strategic level, including impacts to missions, international partners, as well as risks to region, to protect our national security. A fourth analysis from the Department of Homeland Security gives a strategic framework for addressing climate change to govern the departments efforts to combat the climate crisis, the official said. The strategic framework builds on DHS Climate Action Plan, and applies to strategy, plans, policy and budgets across DHS, the official previewed. It includes plans for empowering individuals and communities to develop climate resilience, and building readiness to respond to increases in climate driven emergencies. Its a really pivotal moment to underscore how the US is thinking about climate security, its risks, how were responding to many of those, and the heightened urgency we face in addressing climate change across all the different strategies and tools we have in our toolbox to demonstrate US leadership on this critical issue, the senior administration official said.",21/10/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/21/politics/climate-change-reports/index.html
"This might just look like grass, but it has the power to absorb a load of our carbon emissions","Forests have long been celebrated as the natural heroes in the fight against the climate crisis. They are so good at absorbing and storing carbon dioxide, a consortium of environmental groups are calling on the world to plant one trillion trees over the next decade. But while we are looking up at the treetops for climate solutions, some campaigners are urging the world to look down, where another answer lies  right under our feet. Forests, peatlands, deserts and tundra can all absorb and hold stocks of carbon-dioxide (CO2). Of all the carbon held in land-based ecosystems, around 34% can be found in grasslands, data from the World Resources Institute show. Thats not much less than the 39% held in forests. Whether you look at the Serengeti, the Cerrado in Brazil, whether you look at whats left of the prairies in North America or the steppes of Mongolia  every single one of our major, iconic grassland habitats is under threat at the moment, Ian Dunn, chief executive of the British conservation organization Plantlife, told CNN. Theres also plenty of it in the United Kingdom, which will host world leaders and climate negotiators in just over a week at the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow, Scotland. Among several items on the agenda is how to protect forests and plant more trees to help slash global emissions. But Plantlife, among other groups, is campaigning for grasslands to be protected at an international level and part of any deal that emerges in Glasgow. While leaders meet in the Scottish city, Plantlife is working to restore more than 100,000 hectares of meadows, including one on the other side of the United Kingdom, in the southern English county of Kent. The Ranscombe Farm Nature Reserve looks just like your typical patch of English countryside, with its soft rolling hills and grazing cattle. The grass here looks ordinary, browned in patches from the autumn weather. But come spring, the rare orchids, bellflowers and rock roses will bloom in a celebration of this grasslands biodiversity. Restoring species-rich ecosystems like this takes time, said Ben Sweeney, Ranscombe Farms manager, who has been working on this grassland since 2010. It will take a couple of decades, he said. Ranscombe Farm protects not only grasslands but also woodlands, rough grazing pastures and crop fields for rare plants. Sweeney explains that just like with an animal sanctuary, Ranscombe Farm nurtures rare plants in small sections of the reserve, where they are thriving, and can hopefully grow and spread out into bigger habitats soon. But even after years of careful management, rangers have not been able to reverse all the impacts that farming and land degradation have had on the site. In the UK, these vital habitats have been slowly disappearing as a consequence of decades of intensive agriculture, housing development, and infrastructure build-up over the last century. The UK has lost more than 2 million acres of grasslands as urban and woodland areas expand, according to the UK Center of Ecology & Hydrology. That concerns activists, because grasslands not only store carbon but also serve as a buffer for extreme weather and help prevent soil erosion. Their roots hold together light soil, and the ground cover prevents erosion from wind and water. These habitats help with natural flood management by holding water after extreme weather events, then releasing it gradually. The loss of grasslands also threatens the important species that rely on them, like bees, butterflies and other pollinators. A recent study published by the University of Manchester revealed the UKs grasslands store more than 1.8 billion metric tons of carbon. Thats the equivalent of storing the yearly emissions from about 400 million cars. But they are pretty much ignored or have been ignored in many sustainability policies, said soil expert and ecology professor Richard Bardgett, the studys lead researcher. Another study, published in 2018 in IOP Science, concluded that grasslands in California could play a bigger role than forests as carbon sinks, as they are less vulnerable to fires and drought, which parts of the world will experience more of as the Earth continues to warm. Thats because grasslands keep most of their carbon locked in their roots underground  even during drought and fire  unlike forests, in which carbon is spread up and throughout trees. When managed poorly, grasslands can become a net source of emissions, rather than a sink to remove them. Rearing livestock on grassland, too, plays a major role in methane emissions, which is also contributing to the climate crisis. A global increase in demand for meat and dairy products, as well as soy, is putting pressure on grasslands. The worlds most biodiverse savanna, the Cerrado in Brazil, has been reduced to around half its original size, mainly for the expansion of beef and soy production, according to the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), which says the Cerrado loses an area equivalent to the size of Sao Paulo every three months. In China, vast expanses of grasslands are in a state of ecological crisis, according to scientists, caused by overgrazing of the land. Meanwhile, in the United States, the expansion of farmland has led to the prairies of the Great Plains losing an average four football fields every minute, according to a WWF report published in 2020. While grassland protection is a global concern, there are growing expectations for the UK to show climate leadership ahead of COP26. Campaigners are disappointed with the omission of grasslands as a nature-based solution in the governments Net Zero Strategy, which is being seen as a potential blueprint for other nations climate roadmaps. The importance of grasslands in carbon capture, improved biodiversity, sustainable food production, water management and societal wellbeing continues to be missed in this report and in government policy, Dunn said. We need to be working on a mosaic of habitats. Craig Bennett, chief executive of The Wildlife Trusts, said that the governments Net Zero Strategy had significant gaps and that its authors, from the government, dont seem to have fully recognized the role that nature can play. Theres little new for nature in the strategy, he said. Instead, old policies are being recycled  and its not enough. The land restoration policies will rely on a modest $880 million (640 million) Nature for Climate fund, which had already been announced in the Conservative governments election manifesto, Bennett points out. A Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) spokesperson told CNN it was protecting grasslands at some reserve sites in England, launching a pilot scheme for more sustainable farming practices, and giving more than $55 million (40 million) in grants for nature recovery projects. Biodiversity loss and climate change are global problems requiring global solutions, the spokesperson said. But Defra did not comment when asked whether grasslands would be discussed at COP26 and sent quotes around the importance of ending illegal logging in forests as a nature-based climate solution. A group of 38 British lawmakers are also calling for international recognition and protection for grasslands at COP26. In a motion, they want parliaments House of Commons to recognize the role of grasslands for its ability to reduce emissions, reduce flood risk and act as critical ecosystems for pollinators. They urge government ministers to use the opportunity of COP26 in Glasgow to seek international recognition and protections for species-rich grasslands, to lead by example in taking action to mitigate the effects of climate change and increase biodiversity and to ensure that those areas of natural beauty are preserved for future generations to enjoy.",22/10/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/22/europe/grasslands-carbon-storage-climate-cop26-intl/index.html
Islanders sue Australia for inaction on climate change,"A group of Torres Strait Islanders living off Australias north coast filed a court claim against the Australian government on Tuesday, alleging it has failed to protect them from climate change which now threatens their homes. The case brought on behalf of the remote islands of Boigu and Saibai in the Torres Strait is the first climate class action brought by Australias First Nations people, its backers said. It happened to be filed the same day that Canberra adopted a target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The case is being modeled on one that environmental group Urgenda Foundation led against the government of the Netherlands, saying it had a legal responsibility to protect Dutch citizens from climate change. That case resulted in the Dutch High Court ordering the government to cut carbon emissions faster than planned. The Torres Strait Islands, dotted north of Australia, face the threat of floods and salt ruining their soil as global warming leads to more storms and rising sea levels. There is high confidence that Torres Strait Island communities and livelihoods are vulnerable to major impacts of climate change from even small sea level rises, the claim filed with the Federal Court said. One of the two plaintiffs, Paul Kabai, said his people have lived on the islands for more than 65,000 years, but communities there might be forced to leave if they face more flood and storm damage. Becoming climate refugees means losing everything: our homes, our culture, our stories and our identity, Kabai said in a statement. The case is being supported by a non-profit advocacy group, Grata Fund, and Urgenda and is being run by class action firm Phi Finney McDonald. Grata said it expects the case will be heard in the third quarter of 2022 with a decision likely to take up to 18 months. The islanders filed a human rights complaint to the United Nations two years ago on similar grounds which has yet to be resolved.",27/10/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/27/australia/islanders-sue-australia-climate-change-intl-hnk/index.html
US vs. China: How the world? two biggest emitters stack up on climate,"China and the United States are the worlds two biggest greenhouse gas emitters, so any attempt to address the climate crisis will need to involve deep emissions cuts from these two powerhouse nations. Chinas emissions are more than double those of the US, but historically, the US has emitted more than any other country in the world. There are many factors to consider when judging a countrys climate credentials, and as leaders gather in Glasgow, Scotland for COP26 from Sunday, the US and Chinas plans will be in the spotlight. Heres how the two stack up against each other. In 2006, China overtook the US as the worlds biggest emitter of carbon dioxide (CO2)  the most abundant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. In 2019, the last year before the pandemic hit, Chinas greenhouse gas emissions were nearly 2.5 times that of the US, and more than all the worlds developed countries combined, according to an analysis from Rhodium Group. In terms of CO2-equivalent  which is a way of measuring all greenhouse gases as if they were CO2  China emitted 14.1 billion metric tons in 2019. Thats more than a quarter of the worlds total emissions. By contrast, the US was responsible for 5.7 billion tons, 11% of total emissions, followed by India (6.6%) and the European Union (6.4%). When scientists measure greenhouse gas emissions, they look at the total emissions that a country pumps into the air on their own land every year. Those emissions come from anything powered by fossil-fuels, including driving cars that run on gasoline, flying, heating and lighting buildings with power generated from coal, natural gas or oil, as well as from powering industry. Other sources, like emissions from deforestation, are included too. No country in the world has put more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than the United States. And by a long way. While China is by far the biggest emitter today, it hasnt always been. And thats important because emissions released even hundreds of years ago have contributed to global warming today. The world has already warmed by 1.2 degrees Celsius since the start of the Industrial Revolution, and scientists say we need to keep it to 1.5 degrees to stave off worsening impacts of the climate crisis. Chinas CO2 emissions began accelerating in the 2000s as the country rapidly developed. Advanced countries, like the US, UK and many in Europe, have been industrializing  and emitting climate-altering gases in the process  for around 200 years. A lot of the comforts of living in a developed country have come at the cost of the climate. Since 1850, China has emitted 284 billion tons of CO2, according to new analysis by Carbon Brief, a UK-based organization covering climate, energy and policy. The US, on the other hand, industrialized decades earlier and has released 509 billion tons of CO2  twice as much. China is a huge country of 1.4 billion people, so it makes sense it would emit more than smaller nations overall. But when you look at emissions per capita, the average Chinese person emits quite a bit less than the average American. In 2019, Chinas per capita emissions reached 10.1 tons. By comparison, the US reached 17.6 tons, according to the Rhodium Group. This in part comes down to lifestyle. Americans earn more money, they own more gas-guzzling cars, and they fly more than the average Chinese person, according to Climate Transparencys 2021 report, citing independent energy research company Enerdata. Thats not to say China shouldnt be slashing emissions. Chinas per capita carbon footprint is rapidly catching up with those of wealthier nations  in the past 20 years, its nearly tripled. In 2020, fossil fuels made up 87% of Chinas domestic energy mix, with 60% from coal, 20% from oil and 8% from natural gas, according to Enerdata. In the US, 80% of the energy mix comes from fossil fuels. Of that, 33% is from oil, 36% from natural gas, and 11% from coal, Enerdata figures showed. Natural gas produces fewer emissions than coal, but it is still harmful to the climate, and there are growing concerns that the US and other parts of the world are investing too heavily in gas instead of renewables. China is the worlds biggest user and producer of coal, consuming more than half the worlds supply. Thats in part because China produces so many products and materials for the world, which is why its sometimes referred to as the worlds factory. China produces more than half of the worlds steel and cement, which is made from burning coking coal. Alternative fuels for these heavy industries, like green hydrogen, are in development but are not widely available yet at scale. The emissions from just those two industries in China are higher than the European Unions total CO2 emissions, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). To reach net zero by 2050, 90% of global electricity generation should come from renewable sources, with solar and wind accounting for nearly 70%, according to the IEA. While China is the worlds biggest emitter and still relies heavily on coal, it is producing huge amounts of renewable energy as well. In terms of energy mix, China and the US are around the same. Wind, solar, hydro-power, geothermal, as well as biomass and waste, make up 10% of Chinas energy consumption. The US was not far off, at 9%. But nearly half of that is from biomass, which is energy derives from substance that were recently alive, like wood from trees, algae or animal waste. Some experts and scientists argue isnt always truly renewable. But because China uses much more power overall, it has produced more renewable energy than the US in real terms. In 2020, China produced 745,000 gigawatt-hours of energy from wind and solar, according to Enerdata. The US produced 485,000 gigawatt-hours. In terms of capacity, however, China was the global leader in 2020, when it built nearly half of all the worlds renewables installations, according to the Renewables 2021 Global Status Report. It nearly doubled its capacity from 2019. China has built vast solar and wind farms  producing more solar PVs and wind turbines than any other nation. It also has the biggest electric vehicle market, taking 38.9% of the global share of electric car sales, while the US took 9.9%, the renewables report said. Looking ahead, the US climate plans are more ambitious than Chinas  US President Joe Biden has pledged to at least halve US emissions by 2030, from 2005 levels  but China is at a different stage of development, so that should be a factor in working out what the countrys fair share of climate action should be. China is also ahead of the US on renewables. Its also yet to be seen how much of the US Democrats cornerstone climate policy can make it through Congress. China expresses its commitments in terms of carbon intensity which allows for more emissions the more its GDP rises, which makes it difficult to compare to the US. It submitted its new emissions plan to the UN on Thursday, but made only a modest improvement. Climate Action Tracker, which synthesizes countries targets, rates the US domestic policies as better than Chinas, almost on track to contain global warming to 2 degrees Celsius. When adjusted to consider what would be each countrys fair share, they both get a highly insufficient rating. In other words, neither country is cutting enough carbon or making the transition to renewables fast enough to limit warming to 1.5 degrees.",29/10/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/28/world/china-us-climate-cop26-intl-hnk/index.html
"G20 agrees on key climate goals around global warming limits and coal financing, but lacks firm commitments","The Group of 20s leaders summit ended Sunday with an agreement on climate that commits its member nations to end coal financing by the end of the year and to aim to contain global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. But the final communique lacked firm pledges and failed to put an end date on the actual use of coal. It did not make any commitments to improve on issues like climate finance, paving the way for difficult negotiations at the COP26 summit in Glasgow, which kicks off in earnest on Monday. In the final statement, the 20 biggest world economies said they would accelerate our actions to achieve net-zero emissions by or around mid-century. Leaders for the first time acknowledged officially that its members emissions reductions plans, known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), needed to be firmed up over this decade to put them on track for net zero by 2050. They said they recognized that G20 members can significantly contribute to the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions and committed to take further action this decade on enhancing where necessary their emissions-reductions pledges for the year 2030. Some countries current contributions do not put them on track to achieve their net-zero goals for the mid-century, several analyses have shown. Scientists say that the world must halve emissions over this decade to have any chance of hitting net zero by 2050 and containing global warming to around 1.5 degrees Celsius. We recognize that the impacts of climate change at 1.5C are much lower than at 2C, the communique states. Keeping 1.5C within reach will require meaningful and effective actions and commitment by all countries, taking into account different approaches, through the development of clear national pathways that align long-term ambition with short- and medium-term goals, and with international cooperation and support, including finance and technology, sustainable and responsible consumption and production as critical enablers, in the context of sustainable development. The G20 agreement reaffirmed the commitment for wealthy nations to transfer $100 billion a year in climate finance to the Global South, an existing agreement that has not been fulfilled. A recent report from the COP26 presidency showed that the world would not meet this target until 2023. It will also agree to the mobilization of money from financial institutions, especially development banks, to fill the gap and fund a global green recovery. Mohamed Adow, director of the climate energy think tank Power Shift Africa, said the message from the G20 was weak. This weak statement from the G20 is what happens when developing countries who are bearing the full force of the climate crisis are shut out of the room. The worlds biggest economies comprehensively failed to put climate change on the top of the agenda ahead of COP26 in Glasgow, Adow said. It also included a first-time acknowledgment of the significant contribution of methane emissions to climate change and the need for its reduction. The US and EU are leading the Global Methane Pledge, which more than 60 countries have signed up to, agreeing to cut methane emissions by 30% over this decade. We acknowledge that methane emissions represent a significant contribution to climate change and recognize, according to national circumstances, that its reduction can be one of the quickest, most feasible and most cost-effective ways to limit climate change and its impacts, the communique read. Methane emissions come largely from leaky fossil fuel infrastructure as well as livestock. Australia has said it will not sign onto the pledge. Other major methane emitters, including Indonesia, have signed on. Several major producers or consumers of coal showed resistance to climate language in the G20 draft communique around decarbonization, especially around the use of coal, Bas Eickhout, an European Union member of parliament, who is close to the talks told CNN. Japan led a group of countries at the G-7 meeting in June to soften language around decarbonizing power systems, and the country  along with China, India, Australia and Russia  want to ensure the language in the current G20 communique does not include firm commitments, said Eickhout, who is a member of the EU Parliaments delegation at the upcoming COP26 talks. Eickhout said that Japan was insisting the communique says that power systems should overwhelmingly decarbonize by the 2030s, rather than making it a clear commitment. That has the backing of China and India, the worlds biggest coal consumers; Australia, the worlds biggest coal exporter by value; as well as Russia, another major exporter and consumer. Russia was resisting putting an end date on the financing of coal projects abroad, a commitment the Chinese President Xi Jinping made in September at the United Nations General Assembly, Eickhout said, but added that Russia was showing some room for compromise.At a news conference at the G20 in Rome, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said that there were quite a large group of nations that are  hold similar concerns about this when asked about specific language related to coal. Well, those matters have been worked through, through the sherpas, and through the communique, he said. So well see what that lands in the next day or so. That resistance from Australia was particularly noted by Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International. If the G20 was a dress rehearsal for COP26, then world leaders fluffed their lines, Morgan said in a statement. Their communique was weak, lacking both ambition and vision, and simply failed to meet the moment. Now they move onto Glasgow where there is still a chance to seize a historic opportunity, but the likes of Australia and Saudi Arabia need to be marginalised, while rich countries need to finally grasp that the key to unlock COP26 is trust.  CNN has reached out to officials in China, Japan, Australia and Russia for comment.",31/10/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/31/politics/g20-climate-communique/index.html
COP26 climate talks off to an ominous start after weak G20 leaders?meeting,"It was in the city of Glasgow that Scottish engineer James Watt improved the workings of the steam engine and, unwittingly, kicked off the Industrial Revolution. Never could he have imagined that humans would burn so much coal, oil and gas over the next two centuries that they would imperil the very climate that has allowed for their existence. More than 120 leaders will speak Monday in the very same city to begin the COP26 climate talks, where they will set the tone for two weeks of negotiations that can either end with a plan to rapidly decarbonize the planet, or make watery statements to delay what the science shows is needed, possibly pushing it off until its too late. Climate leaders and experts are calling it the worlds last best chance to address the climate crisis. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whose government is hosting the talks, will warn Monday that humanity has run down the clock on climate change. Its one minute to midnight, and we need to act now, he will say in an opening speech, according to remarks sent to journalists. We have to move from talk and debate and discussion to concerted, real-world action on coal, cars, cash and trees. Not more hopes and targets and aspirations, valuable though they are, but clear commitments and concrete timetables for change. The G20 leaders meeting that ended in Rome on Sunday suggests that leaders are finally listening to the science, but they still lack the political unity to make the ambitious decisions required to meet the moment. The latest UN climate science report published in August made clear what needs to happen  deep, sustained cuts to greenhouse gas emissions over this decade to have any chance of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees above levels before industrialization. Even with all the newly announced pledges, the world is still on track for 2.7 degrees of heating. Global warming beyond 1.5 degrees will bring worsening impacts of the climate crisis. But the positive news is that the 1.5 limit is entirely in our reach. The UN report showed that by mid-century, the world needs to reach net zero  where greenhouse gas emissions are no greater than the amount removed from the atmosphere  and warming can be stopped in its tracks. All of this scientific language was in the G20 leaders communique, including an acknowledgment that to meet net zero by mid-century, many member nations will need to lift their emissions-reductions pledges, known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), over this decade. But their failure to put an end date on the use of coal  the single biggest contributor to climate change  and to get all countries to firmly commit to net zero by 2050 (as opposed to 2060, as China, Russia and Saudi Arabia have pledged) shows that the countries that use and produce fossil fuels still have a huge amount of sway in global deals on climate. Indeed, Chinas long-awaited new emissions pledge submitted last week was just a fraction higher than its previous one. Russias Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Sunday it wouldnt be strong-armed into net zero by 2050. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison showed no interest in consigning coal to history. India has made no net-zero pledge and, as European lawmaker Bas Eickhout told CNN, it was one of a handful of nations against putting a date on phasing out coal. Michael Mann, a leading scientist at Pennsylvania State University, said it is promising that leaders have acknowledged they need to do more on emissions this decade, but what is important is making sure all big emitters have plans that are consistent with keeping warming below 1.5 degrees. And also a closing of the implementation gap  that is to say, the gap between what heads of state have nominally committed to, and what theyre actually doing, Mann said. Mann warned that COP26 must not be a summit for delay tactics and said he still had hope that countries could agree to a phaseout of coal at the talks, even if the G20 leaders failed to agree on that point. The rather conservative International Energy Agency itself has said there can be no new fossil fuel infrastructure if we are to avert dangerous warming. And the G7 nations committed to phasing out coal and ending support for new coal projects earlier this summer, Mann said. We need to see similar commitments from the G20 countries, including an accelerated schedule for phasing out coal. The G20 statement did commit to an end to coal financing abroad by the end of this year. Chinese President Xi Jinping at the UN General Assembly in September announced an end to Chinese financing of international coal, taking the biggest global financier of coal projects out of the mix. Helen Mountford, vice president of climate and economics at the World Resources Institute, said the agreement and current emissions pledges are not ambitious enough to avoid the most dangerous levels of warming and many were unlikely to actually get countries on track for their own net-zero plans. To keep the 1.5C goal within reach, countries need to set 2030 climate targets that chart a realistic pathway to deliver these net-zero commitments, she said in a statement. Currently, a number of G20 countries are not on a credible trajectory to reach their net-zero goals, including Australia, Russia, China, Saudi Arabia, Brazil and Turkey. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Sunday that he was leaving Rome with my hopes unfulfilled  but at least they are not buried. He was hopeful that Glasgow could still keep the goal of 1.5 degrees alive. His comments reflect the mood of many at COP26. If the G20 couldnt put an end date on coal and make a firm net-zero commitment, there is a sense that getting the whole world on board with those key issues simply wont happen. There is also an issue of trust. The developed world promised more than a decade ago it would transfer $100 billion a year to the Global South to help it transition to low-carbon economies and to adapt to the new world of the climate crisis. That target was not met last year, and a report from the COP26 presidency published last week showed it wouldnt be met until 2023, with the current pledges in hand. Mohamed Nasheed, Maldives former President who leads the Climate Vulnerable Forum, lamented the lack of action in the G20s statement, particularly on the failure to phase out coal. Maldives is a frontline nation in the climate crisis and risks being submerged by sea level rise by the end of the century. This is a welcome start, Nasheed said in a statement. But it wont stop the climate from heating more than 1.5 degrees and devastating large parts of the world, including the Maldives. And so, clearly, this isnt nearly enough. Net zero, the phaseout of coal and delivering on climate finance will still be a priority for negotiators. Other areas that could prove successful are an agreement on ending and reversing deforestation by 2030 and movement around speeding up the transition to electric vehicles globally. Tom Burke, co-founder of climate think tank E3G, was more optimistic, saying the G20 statement showed a change in thinking among leaders around the urgency of the climate crisis. The big win is this shift in the focus from 2050 to 2030. I think thats an important big win, he told CNN. It sends it off to a better start than we had been expecting. The political agreement achieved at the G20 will create political impetus as leaders meet to start the COP.",01/11/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/01/world/cop26-climate-leaders-summit-intl/index.html
What? different about this world climate summit,"World leaders are gathered in Scotland at a massive and consequential United Nations climate change summit known as COP 26. Countries acknowledge the danger of climate change and say theyre committed to doing something about it. But there is increasing alarm that countries wont do enough to hold world temperatures below the key threshold most scientists have set. Ive borrowed most of whats below from CNNs climate team, which covers this topic on a daily basis. The grim takeaway is the growing skepticism over the worlds ability to meet key benchmarks in time to avert catastrophic effects. RELATED: 5 takeaways from the first day of COP26: Bidens apology, Indias pledge, much disappointment Why do they call it COP26? Its the 26th annual conference of parties brought together by the United Nations to address climate change. You might recall the Paris Agreement in 2015, which then-President Donald Trump withdrew the US from and current President Joe Biden subsequently re-entered? That occurred at COP 21, which was held in Paris. What are the countries trying to accomplish? Theyre going to set new goals of what theyll do to help slow climate change. How much can the climate warm before catastrophic consequences occur? The prevailing scientific consensus is that temperatures can rise 1.5 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels before the most catastrophic changes  increasingly devastating fires, floods and droughts  begin to occur. Can temperatures be kept below that 1.5-degree Celsius threshold? Theres a growing consensus that temperatures may rise beyond that level no matter what corrective action is taken. As a result, youll also hear scientists and policymakers refer to the more attainable goal of limiting temperature increases to 2 degrees over pre-industrial levels. 1.5 or 2 degrees Celsius. How much is that in Fahrenheit? Thats 2.7 or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit. What if the world changes its policies right this second? Will that keep the temperatures from rising? As CNN wrote recently, even under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changes most optimistic scenario, in which the worlds emissions begin to drop sharply today and are reduced to net zero by 2050, global temperatures will still peak above the 1.5-degree threshold before falling. What exactly are pre-industrial levels? Were talking, generally, about the climate before the Industrial Revolution. But here again there is debate since the world has been around for a very long time and temperatures have fluctuated. UN reports have referred to the period between 1850 and 1900 as pre-industrial as there were more reliable record-keeping and observations of temperatures then. There are many terms that are unique to the climate vernacular. Weve got a glossary, and it includes definitions of things like achieving net-zero emissions, which means a country is removing as much greenhouse gas from the atmosphere as it emits. How much has the climate changed already? Around 1.2 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels. The effects of climate change are being felt in more frequently extreme weather. The rise in temperatures is happening faster than previously thought, according to one recent UN report. If current policies remain in place, the report estimates the climate will warm 2.7 degrees over pre-industrial levels by 2030, well above the 1.5-degree threshold. Why havent countries addressed this before? Many nations have talked a lot about climate change. CNN published a graphic that overlaid five major climate conferences  starting with the first in 1979  with the rise in average temperatures. Is COP26 going to be different? There is certainly the feeling that the world is running out of time to address climate change. This conference has been called the last best chance for countries to avert climate disaster. Do we know how much a countrys actions can affect the changing climate? There are many educated guesses. Climate Action Tracker applies an independent scientific analysis to various policies. It currently grades the US pathway as insufficient, but much improved from the period of the Trump administration. It grades countries like China and Russia as highly insufficient or critically insufficient. What are US leaders saying? Biden promised in a speech at the conference Monday that the US would do its part to combat climate change, an existential threat to humans. Will we act? Will we do what is necessary? Will we seize the enormous opportunity before us or will we condemn future generations to suffer? Biden implored gathered leaders. This is the decade that will determine the answer. Hours later, however, back in Washington, Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat from coal country, was skeptical the US can afford a massive new spending bill that includes provisions to fight climate change  even thought its price tag was already cut in half to attract his vote. Thats an oversimplification since Manchin seems to be more concerned about expanding Medicare and social spending. But these subjects are tied together in the Democrats spending bill. So its also completely fair to say what the US can offer the world on climate change is directly tied to what Manchin will support. And hes not actively supporting Bidens Build Back Better agenda just yet. What, specifically, is Bidens plan for the US to combat climate change? A larger National Climate Strategy is still being written, but Bidens climate envoy John Kerry and his climate adviser Gina McCarthy released a five-prong plan ahead of the summit: What are other countries doing? There are some major promises. Brazil, for instance, pledged to end illegal deforestation by 2028. But many countries are not doing enough, according to CNNs report: Chinas long-awaited new emissions pledge submitted last week was just a fraction higher than its previous one. Russias Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Sunday it wouldnt be strong-armed into net zero by 2050. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison showed no interest in consigning coal to history. India has made no net-zero pledge and, as European lawmaker Bas Eickhout told CNN, it was one of a handful of nations against putting a date on phasing out coal. Heres a particularly mixed message from China as noted in CNNs live coverage of the summit: In September (Chinese President Xi Jinping) promised that China will not build any new coal-fired power projects abroad; however, the following month he ordered his country to produce as much coal as possible amid an ongoing energy crunch. How do China and the US compare on carbon emissions? Since 2006, China has been the worlds largest emitter, and the US ranks second. Chinas 2019 output was more than 2.5 times the US. Taking a longer view, the US was the top emitter for so long that its cumulative emissions are twice that of Chinas. CNNs Helen Regan and Carlotta Dotto have a detailed comparison. What will COP26 actually accomplish? Kerry and his team downplayed expectations for the summit, particularly since a worldwide energy crunch as countries emerge from the Covid-19 pandemic has led countries to ramp up coal and fossil fuel production rather than cut it. Key leaders from Russia and China chose not to attend the summit. It would be wonderful if everybody came and everybody hit the 1.5 degrees mark now, Kerry told the Associated Press in October. That would be terrific. But some countries just dont have the energy mix yet that allows them to do that.",01/11/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/01/politics/climate-change-what-matters/index.html
Humanity needs to ditch coal to save itself. It also needs to keep the lights on.,"On a quiet Sunday morning, an ear-splitting roar reverberated across the English village of Eggborough as four giant concrete cooling towers imploded and crashed to the ground, transformed to clouds of debris in a matter of seconds. Just moments after their demolition, it became hard to imagine the structures were ever there, so out of place they were, jutting 90 meters into the sky among the green fields surrounding the River Aire. The Eggborough power station is just one of 14 coal plants the United Kingdom has laid to rest over the past decade. In 2012, 40% of the UKs power came from coal. By 2020, it was below 2%. Last year, the country went for 67 days without using any coal for power at all. Climate leaders at the COP26 talks in Glasgow, Scotland, will on Thursday intensify their efforts to put an end date on the use of coal, the biggest single contributor to the climate crisis. At the G20 meeting in Rome over the weekend, leaders failed to specify how they would phase out coal. It will be a tough ask to convince developing countries to go further than the rich world. The picture is fairly rosy in western Europe and even the United States, where it seems the fossil fuel is indeed on its last legs, save for some pockets of resistance. Belgium, Austria and Sweden are among a growing number of European countries that no longer use coal to generate electricity. In the US, which technically has no coal phaseout plan, coal has wound down dramatically in favor of natural gas, which emits about half the carbon dioxide. A slow but steady increase in wind power is also helping put coal out of business. Globally, proposed coal plants are rapidly being canceled. A report by climate think tank E3G found a 76% reduction in proposed coal power since the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015. But the trend is distributed unevenly. Coal plants are still on rise throughout much of Asia, and while power generation from coal technically peaked in 2013, it has basically plateaued since then. The current global energy crisis, triggered by a quicker-than-expected economic rebound amid the pandemic, has even given it a bump. Coal prices last month were at an all-time high. For every Belgium, Austria and Sweden there is a China, India, and Indonesia, where coal is still king. Consigning coal to history is a requirement to rein in rapid climate change, but it may not happen as quickly as Western climate leaders may like. Yet Alok Sharma, the British lawmaker chairing COP26, is hopeful it can still happen. The G20 did agree to stop financing international coal projects by the end of the year, he pointed out. China made a similar commitment in September, which removed the biggest source of international coal financing on the planet. This has effectively ended public finance for overseas coal projects, Sharma told CNN. To meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, all countries need to raise their ambition and act urgently to consign coal to history. There has been some movement. The UK government on Thursday announced that 23 new countries  including big coal users like Poland and Vietnam  and dozens of organizations had committed to stop building new coal projects and to phase out the fossil fuel by the 2030s for developed nations, and 2040s for the developing world. Despite all this progress, a true global transition from coal will only happen when China decides. It was in China that the world saw the first large-scale coal mine as we know them, some 3,000 years ago, and China is likely to be the country that seals coals fate. China now consumes more coal than the rest of the world combined. Thats to keep the lights on for its 1.4 billion people, but also to make huge amounts of goods for export, and heavy-industry items  steel, cement, chemicals  used all around the world. While China has pledged to stop financing coal projects abroad, it is still building coal plants and opening mines at a fast pace. China has more than 1,200 major coal plants in operation, and has plans to build some 150 more, according to the Global Energy Monitor (GEM), which tracks fossil fuel infrastructure and financing around the world. In 2019 alone, China opened 102 mines, GEM data shows. The scale of what China has been building over the past two decades is extraordinary. Its now half of the worlds coal power, GEMs program director for coal, Christine Shearer, told CNN. Theres been a lot of progress in halting the increase in coal plant proposals and in stabilizing coal power demand globally, but it just needs to happen much, much faster, if we want to keep climate goals alive. Scientists say the world needs to halve greenhouse gas emissions this decade and reach net zero by mid-century to have any chance of containing global warming to a level that will avert catastrophe. To reach net-zero by 2050, you really need a zero-carbon power sector a decade earlier, Shearer said. So the world shouldnt be using coal at all past 2040. Chinas climate envoy Xie Zhenhua said in Glasgow on Tuesday that his countrys goal was to strictly control coal consumption between now and 2025, and gradually reduce it until some point before 2030. Beijing also said recently that fossil fuels would make up just 20% of its energy mix by 2060, when it plans to be carbon neutral. Global climate leaders, including Sharma and US climate envoy John Kerry, have pressed China to move even faster and with more ambition. China says its doing its fair share, and as a developing nation shouldnt be expected to have the same targets as the developed world. Developed countries in the past 200 years, in the process of industrialization, have been emitting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and they have an unshirkable historical responsibility for global climate change, Chinas foreign ministry told CNN in a statement. China has always done what it says on responding to climate change. We will fully implement our commitments and will work hard to do better within our capabilities. A global energy crunch with China at its center hasnt helped matters. Just a year ago, Beijing officials were asking provincial leaders to produce less coal, in part to help China meet its climate targets. But last month it ordered more than 70 mines in the province of Inner Mongolia to add 1 billion tons of coal to its output. Just a few weeks ago, it told every mine operator in the country to produce as much coal as they possibly can. Looking at the activity in Inner Mongolia, its hard to imagine China meeting even its current pledges. More than 300 coal plants and 100 mines are dotted all along this province, which stretches 1,500 miles all the way up to Russia, on shifting landscapes of grassland steppes, desert, forests and wetlands. But the province also has huge renewables potential, some of which it is exploring. In the sand dunes of the provinces Kubuqi desert lies a giant solar farm the size of nearly 200 football fields, its panels carefully arranged so that if you peer at it from an airplane, they form the image of a galloping horse. Slowly, a re-greening project here is bringing plants, grass and agriculture back to this desert, once teeming with life that was lost from overuse of the land. Li Danqing, a climate and energy campaigner with Greenpeace in Beijing, said that coal-mining provinces in China were no different to those in any other country that has struggled to wean off coal  it has a lot to do with jobs. Some of the plants built in Inner Mongolia arent even necessary to meet demand, she said. Theres huge pressure to secure peoples livelihoods in these coal-mining provinces. So this is one thing that still needs to be solved  how to find new industries for them, Li told CNN. Renewables is a very good option because Inner Mongolia not only has very abundant coal reserves, but also its wind and solar resources are very abundant. So Inner Mongolia could really be a role model for these coal-mining provinces to lead to a more low-carbon economy. At the COP26 conference, Sharma had hoped that the developing and emerging world, including big-coal users like China, India and Indonesia, would end their use of the fossil fuel by 2040. While an end date on coal in Asia is not in sight, there is some movement. After an announcement that the US, UK and EU would help South Africa fund its coal transition, Indonesian Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said her country was looking for a similar deal. Indonesia is the seventh biggest coal user in the world and relies on it heavily for power. It is also the worlds biggest exporter of coal by volume. The expectation is that developed countries, which have already industrialized and contributed the most to the climate crisis, would go first, by 2030. But theyre not all there yet. Australias delegation went to the COP26 talks in Glasgow with the weakest climate plans of all the G20s developed nations. It has no clear end date on coal and its government has said it plans to keep mining and exporting the fossil fuel well beyond 2030. The country makes more money than any other nation from exporting coal from its roughly 100 mines, and it has the highest proportion of coal in its energy mix of all the developed G20 nations, at 54%, according to climate and energy think tank Ember. As long as countries like China demand huge volumes of coal, Australias government has made clear it will keep supplying them. Australia makes around $50 billion annually in coal exports and the industry directly employs around 50,000 Australians, government data shows. The country approved three new mines recently in the space of a month. The real perk for the Australian government is that all the coal it exports isnt counted in the countrys official greenhouse gas emissions levels. UN rules say that a countrys emissions are based on the fossil fuels they burn, not the ones they dig up and sell offshore. Our coal is the worlds best. People want it. Countries need it. Self-interest will come first every time, says Joel Fitzgibbon, who has represented Australias Hunter Region in the federal parliament since 1996. Fitzgibbon is a member of the Australian opposition Labor Party, but he, too, believes that coal has a decades-long future in the country and can even continue to be mined and used without compromising a promise by Australia to reach net zero 2050  where the country would not emit any more greenhouse gas than it removes. Tim Baxter, a senior researcher at the Australian Climate Council, which is independent of the government, dismissed Fitzgibbons reckoning: Its at odds with the advice of every serious authority on the topic, including the historically-conservative International Energy Agency (IEA), which stated in its Net Zero 2050 pathway in May this year that achieving net zero requires that no new coal, oil or gas projects of any kind are developed anywhere in the world from now, Baxter told CNN. Some 12,000 people in Fitzgibbons electorate are directly employed by the coal industry, earning average salaries north of 100,000 Australian dollars ($75,000) a year. I think the benefits of the industry far outweigh any negative effects it has on the local community, Fitzgibbon said. The lush Australian Hunter Valley feels like one of the last places on Earth that should have a coal mine. This part of the country is known for its world-famous wines, and attracts tourists from all around the world. On weekends, it is teeming with Sydney residents, who make the two-hour drive north to escape the city and enjoy the regions vineyards, restaurants and farms selling organic produce. The Hunter, as Australians call the region, is also on a front line of the climate crisis. It was devastated by the Black Summer bushfires of 2019-2020, an event that scientists have linked to climate change. But the way Fitzgibbon sees it, Australia is doing the world a climate favor by exporting coal. If we were to stop sending thermal coal to Asia tomorrow it would be replaced by something less efficient and would add to, not subtract from, global emissions, he said. There may be some truth to that. Different types of coal can emit different amounts of carbon dioxide. But climate scientists say the world needs to end its use altogether, and theres little point in arguing which type of coal is cleaner than another. The idea that the coal industrys benefits outweigh the drawbacks in this region is also debatable. Parts of Bulga are being swallowed up by its coal mine and it has been transformed to something of a sleepy town. Yancoal, the Chinese company that now owns the Mount Thorley-Warkworth mine there, has bought up the properties its operations have encroached on, even the local cafe. We were driven out by coal, said former Bulga resident Robert McLaughlin. He is at least thankful that he could sell his home to Yancoal in 2019, and pack up and move to another town. We were torn when we left, he said. We felt like we were abandoning our friends. In a statement sent to CNN, Yancoal said its operations had full government approval and it had honored its obligations to those it bought land from. This does not constitute harm to the community, the company said, adding that it had bought the local service station and local tavern, and leased them out to preserve the village amenities. But not everyone has been able to move. On the outskirts of the tiny Hunter town of Bulga, trees that separate resident John Kreys home from the mine remain charred almost two years after the Black Summer fires. This year alone he has received nearly 100 text messages from the state of New South Wales Environmental Protection Agency, alerting him that PM10 levels  which are linked to asthma, lung disease and cancer  have reached unsafe levels. Yancoal acknowledges that dust, air quality, noise and lighting from mines are key concerns in Bulga, but it said it was taking measures necessary to reduce pollution, and that air quality-related complaints were dropping. Krey has spent years campaigning against the expansion of open-cut mines in the Hunter Valley, but he now feels like its a lost cause. Weve got enough coal here to satisfy whatever the demand is, and yet were giving approval to open more mines, Krey says from his veranda, overlooking the grey of Mount Thorley. I think the world will push Australia into doing the right thing, he said, referring to the COP26 climate summit. But its too late for us here. Data from the IEA shows that coal is still the most widely used source for electricity, and by a huge margin. In 2019, the last year before the pandemic hit the world, around 63% of worldwide electricity generation came from coal, gas and oil. Coal accounted for nearly 10 million gigawatt hours of energy  about 160% more than energy derived from the next biggest source, natural gas (another fossil fuel), which generated just over 6 million GWh. Hydropower came next (around 4 million GWh). Wind was 1 million GWh and solar just 680,000 GWh. I dont like to be pessimistic but its important to be factual. And coal consumption is at least close to an all-time high, Carlos Fernandez Alvarez, a senior energy analyst at the IEA, told CNN. I want to be optimistic, but we will have to see how the technology evolves  we are gaining on efficiencies, reducing the cost of every useful technology. He added that investment in renewables was increasing and capacity was growing, but they need to move much faster to meet a timeline of phasing out coal by 2040 globally. We cant phase out coal if we cant replace it, otherwise were talking about a lack of energy, and thats poverty, Alvarez said. So leaders need to look to clean energy, to accelerate investment and help the developing world make a green transition. Beyond electricity, however, there are some heavy-industry sectors where coal is at the moment near impossible to replace. Steelmaking and cement production, for example, are made from burning coking coal, which has a very high carbon content, and cant yet be replaced with energy like solar and wind. The emissions from steelmaking and cement production in China alone are higher than the European Unions total CO2 emissions, IEA data shows. Green hydrogen  which is made by electrolyzing water using renewable energy  may be an alternative, but it is still not widely available at scale. A deal on green steel at Glasgow recognizes its potential and aims to kick-start rapid global investment into the energy source and machines needed to produce it. In Austria, near the city of Graz, energy company Verbund is experimenting with green hydrogen at its natural gas power plant. The Mellach plant is a symbol of Austrias rapid energy transition and what is possible  the plant sits on the site of what was the countrys last coal-fired power plant, which shut its doors last year. The gas plants main role is to stabilize the national grid, but Verbund hopes its plant can increase its share of the renewable source in its energy mix. Austria aims to run fully on renewables, for electricity at least, by 2030. The idea is that on windy or sunny days, excess renewable electricity can be harnessed here to produce green hydrogen gas, which can then be stored or transported for later use. When its cloudy or when the turbines arent spinning so well, hydrogen can be converted back into electricity using a clean chemical reaction. Climate change is reality, so we have to make a massive move towards renewables, said Michael Strugl, chief executive of Verbund. We do not have all the answers, Strugl said. We have to do research, we have to put strong efforts on innovation as well. But what we know is that we need this net-zero strategy in order to save the planet.",04/11/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/03/world/coal-climate-cop26-global-china-australia-intl/index.html
The Dutch are masters at taming water. Climate change is teaching them to just let it flood,"In the spitting rain that is endemic to the Netherlands, Anneke van Lelieveld bundles up in her bright orange cardigan at her home on the New Merwede River, and turns to look out over the wetlands behind her garden. She loves the vista. She loves docking a boat just strides from her vegetable plot. She loves spotting eagles and beavers. But there is a reticence to her joy. The mixed feeling is that it was my neighbors land, van Lelieveld says. Im sad because I know how sad my neighbor is. Because he was giving up his land. What used to be her neighbors farm, walled off from the nearby river that posed a constant threat, is now pockmarked with water. It is flooded, purposefully, to soak up water when the river swells. Its not suitable for farming, but Van Lelieveld is able to live here. A simple small dike keeps her home and some others on the street dry, even if their backyards are not. This is all part of an ambitious climate project aptly called Room for the Rivers. The Dutch have battled for centuries to keep water off the land in their low-lying country, more than a quarter of which lies below sea level. While adaptation sounds like a dull word in climate talk, the Dutch have been adapting to the whims of water for a long time. Pumps, dikes and giant moveable seawalls protect the country, at least half of which is threatened by floods. Nothing about the Dutch example is perfectly replicable: Its landscape, tradition of political powersharing, and water-aware culture are unique. But theres a lot to be learned. The climate crisis is only intensifying that vulnerability. Erratic weather is no longer a problem for the future  its clearly here, in most parts of the world  nor is it a problem just of extremes, like blazing forest fires and flash floods. Its also a matter of getting organized, as governments and people make life-or-death decisions now for potentially worse threats arriving in an even warmer world. Dutch expertise has come in handy for people running into trouble with water around the world. In the 17th Century, King Charles I asked a Dutchman, Cornelius Vermuyden, to help drain the marshes in Englands Cambridgeshire. When New York City was devastated by Hurricane Sandy in 2012, the US Government turned to the Dutch for help. When the Ever Given ran aground in the Suez Canal, a Dutch company was contracted to get it out. But climate change means that these brute-force methods that have worked for centuries wont always cut it. A dike can only be so large before it collapses under its own weight, and heightening it only increases the risk when it fails. In the 1990s, the Dutch government started to change tack, better understanding that the natural state of bodies of water exist for good reasons. One example is low-lying, uninhabited land next to rivers that could flood and help absorb water when it rains heavily upstream. That meant doing something unusual for the Dutch: knocking down some of the walls that once held back water, and moving people off the land. To understand why the project is so vital, right now, the headwaters of the rivers that empty into the Netherlands offer an insight. Some 300 kilometers (186 miles) up the Rhine River from Van Lelievelds humble house lies the Ahr, a tributary that snakes through picturesque hills of west German wine country. It was here in July that floodwaters rose higher than they ever had in the collective memory of Dernau, a small town nestled between steep slopes of vineyards. Its not easy to finds words for it, says Lea Kreuzberg, 23, who on July 14 was sitting in her apartment above the winery she runs with her father. In the space of just a few hours, floodwaters spilled into the courtyard, submerged the ground floor, and rose into her apartment. Kreuzberg, her boyfriend, and two winery employees retreated to the buildings top floor. They spent a terrifying night together, preserving phone battery to communicate with Kreuzbergs father, who was on vacation in Austria. The water finally peaked, then slowly subsided. Finally, at 5pm the next day, they were rescued. In the first days, the rain made me feel very uncomfortable, Kreuzberg said, referring to the time immediately after the floods. When it started raining a bit more, the emotions came up again and I start crying, she added. When we will go back here, it will not be easy to live here without being afraid. The human impact of Julys flooding was devastating. In the state of Rhineland Palatinate alone, it killed 133 people. In total, 180 were killed in Germany and 39 in Belgium. One victim was never found. Nearly 15 centimeters (6 inches) of rain fell in a single 24-hour period from July 14 to 15, according to The European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites, causing widespread damage not only in Germany and Belgium, but also in France, Luxembourg, Switzerland and the Dutch province of Limburg. The region is no stranger to floods. But EUMESTAT said that Julys rainfall was particularly devastating and that those kinds of intense storms are becoming more likely with changing climate. To Franziska Schnitzler, standing in the ruins of her family hotel and restaurant, that connection is clear. The 350-year-old, timber-frame building it once occupied was deemed unsafe and torn down. We do live with the climate change, Schnitzler says. And this is the result. And for young and old alike, climate change is intersecting with a crisis of mental health. In the days after the floods, three people in Dernau took their own lives. It was the grandma of one of my best friends, Schnitzler says. One night she woke me up and she said, My grandma, my grandma, my grandma. That was so hard, to lose someone after the flood. The people who have given up their homes and land in the Netherlands did it not primarily for themselves, but for others. They were asked to sacrifice to protect people in cities up- and down-river, for whom floods pose a much more acute threat. It was major flooding from rivers in 1993 and 1995 that served as a wake-up call, says Hans Brouwer, who for years has managed projects for the Dutch governments Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management. We focused for decades on the sea, and defending us from storm surges, he recalls. And then we were surprised by our rivers. And in 95 the decision was made to evacuate a quarter of a million people. So that really made an impression. Those floods coincided with some of the first reports from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ringing the climate alarm bells. We realized that we can expect even more water from the rivers, and at the same time it would be difficult to get rid of that water because of sea-level rise, Brouwer said. Some 15 years ago, Brouwers colleagues came to Nol Hooijmaijers, a dairy farmer, and told him that that eye-shaped spit of land that he and 17 other families called home would soon need to be turned into a floodplain. We had been through 93 and 95. So we did think that something would have to be done at some point. What that was, we didnt know, Hooijmaijers, now 72, said. Then when the government came and said that this area might be used as a floodplain, yeah, that was of course a huge shock. We had been convinced that we could stay here and farm for generations. He and his fellow farmers got together and decided that would try to turn a threat into an opportunity. While some left rather than deal with the heartache, Hooijmaijers, his wife, and seven other families decided to stay. They convinced the government to build enormous, six-meter-high artificial dwelling mounds, or terps, on which to relocate their farms and houses. The northern dike that had protected their land was in turn lowered, allowing floodwater to spill over the land. The Room for the Rivers project was a monument to planning, foresight, and what can be achieved when government and citizen engage in collective action. Thirty-four projects  coming in at a total cost of $2.66 billion  mean that Dutch rivers can now absorb about 25% more water than they could in 1995. During Julys enormous rainfall, van Lelieveld watched as the river swelled, picked up speed, and turned brown from silt and debris. Its then that you can see the function of the region, because we didnt have any issues with high water here, she said. I hope that people understand that, what I have sacrificed to do that. Brouwer described a paradigm shift in which engineers realized we dont even always understand how nature acts, but we take nature seriously. The design for the area in which van Lelieveld lives, he explained, was based on a century-old map  not knowing exactly why it functioned in that time, but having confidence that nature took the right choices. The project created the wetlands that flooded her former neighbors farm and are now home to vast flocks of birds. When she goes out in her boat, she thinks of the struggle that the farmer waged to get decent compensation for his land. On the one hand, I dont dare to enjoy it, because I also experienced that sadness, and saw what it did to people, she said. But on the other hand, Im very proud of what we achieved in this region. And that we can also be an example, that its possible.",05/11/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/05/world/netherlands-flooding-strategy-germany-climate-cop26-intl/index.html
The next front in Facebook? misinformation battle: climate change,"In August 2019, when a Facebook employee typed climate change into the platforms search bar, the auto-fill suggestions that popped up included climate change debunked and climate change is a hoax. The results prompted the employee to ask in a post on the companys internal site: Do our policies combatting the spread of misinformation on Facebook apply to climate denialism? More than a year later, in January 2021, a Facebook employee noted a similar concern when searching for climate change on the social networks video-on-demand service, Facebook Watch. The second result, according to the employee, was a video titled Climate Change Panic is not based on facts. The video had been posted nine days earlier and already had 6.6 million views, according to another internal post. These examples were flagged by Facebook (FB) employees on the companys internal site, according to documents reviewed by CNN Business. These were part of the hundreds of internal company documents included as evidence to support disclosures made to the Securities and Exchange Commission and provided to Congress in redacted form by Facebook (FB) whistleblower Frances Haugens legal counsel. A consortium of news organizations, including CNN, reviewed the redacted versions received by Congress. The documents highlight how, for years, some employees of the social media company  which recently changed its name to Meta  have raised alarms about climate change misinformation spreading on its platforms, and called on the company to do more to crack down on it. There has long been public pressure on the social media company to take action on climate change misinformation. In March, CEO Mark Zuckerberg admitted to lawmakers that climate misinformation ... is a big issue. This week, Meta announced additional climate-related efforts that coincided with the start of the COP26 Climate Summit, where world leaders gathered to discuss efforts to prevent catastrophic disruptions due to climate change. Meta was already facing heavy scrutiny following the leak of tens of thousands of pages of internal documents Haugen took from the company, now known as the Facebook Papers. Although Facebook has taken a number of steps in recent years to address climate change misinformation, it has so far resisted calls to remove such content altogether, the way it does for Covid-19 or election misinformation. Instead, it has focused on efforts to promote good information and relies on third-party fact checkers to label false claims. On Monday, the companys VP of Global Affairs, Nick Clegg, announced in a blog post additional steps Facebook is taking to address climate change, including expanding informational labels on some posts about climate change to more than a dozen countries. But the companys own research has hinted at limitations with some of its strategy, including highlighting user trust and awareness issues with its Climate Science Center, a dedicated hub for climate change information that launched last year, the documents show. Some employees have also expressed concern that Facebooks current efforts arent sufficient, documents show. In a comment on another internal post from earlier this year about the companys efforts to combat climate change  including by enabling people to raise funds to fight climate change on Instagram and Facebook  one employee said: This is great work. Can we take it a step farther and start classifying and removing climate misinformation and hoaxes from our platforms? Meta has repeatedly said the Facebook Papers paint a skewed picture of the company and its efforts. The company said the internal documents underscore the reasons why weve launched our Climate Science Center and has informed our approach to connecting people with authoritative information about climate change from the worlds leading climate change organizations. As a result, more than 100,000 people are visiting the Climate Science Center every day and were continuing to update it with new features and more actionable resources so people know how they can make a difference, Meta spokesperson Kevin McAlister said in a statement to CNN Business. He added that on Facebook Search and Watch, the company has removed climate denial suggestions and now directs users to the Climate Science Center and other authoritative information sources, and that misinformation makes up only a small percentage of all climate-related content on the companys platforms. Experts, however, say the stakes could not be higher for Facebook to further ramp up its solutions for this problem  and soon. Given that [climate change] is an existential threat, we cant be casual about the seriousness about the threat of climate misinformation, said John Cook, a post-doctoral research fellow at the Climate Change Communication Research Hub at Monash University. It needs to be addressed with the same level of urgency and proactiveness that theyre showing with Covid-19 and election misinformation. Facebook launched its Climate Science Center last fall in an effort to provide users with authoritative, reliable information about climate change and climate science. In September, it said the resource had expanded to 16 countries and was reaching more than 100,000 daily visitors. (Facebook had 1.93 billion daily active users as of that same month.) On Monday, the company said the Climate Science Center will soon be available in more than 100 countries. But the companys internal documents suggest there may be barriers to effectively countering misinformation with the Climate Science Center. Facebook is a key place for people to get information related to climate change, so there is an opportunity to build knowledge through our platform, according to one internal report posted in April. However, the researchers found user awareness of the Climate Science Center was low. The report said 66% of users surveyed who had visited the center say they are not aware of it; 86% of those who hadnt visited it said they didnt know about it. The report also found that some users did not trust the information Facebook published in its Climate Science Center, especially US users. This tracks with research on the effects of climate misinformation, according to Cook. Providing facts is necessary but its insufficient to deal with misinformation, Cook said, adding that his and others research has found that misinformation can cancel out facts. For example, if a Facebook post says one thing and a fact-check label says another, it can leave a user confused and believing neither. An effective strategy to address climate misinformation needs to be a mix of providing facts and countering misinformation with fact checking, but also there need to be efforts to reduce the spread of misinformation or to bring down misinformation, Cook said. Meta, however, says that research was meant to inform internal discussions but was not representative of its user base and therefore not to measure casual relationships between its users and real-world issues. It also notes that some outside research has found that, in general, people in the United States are less likely to believe in climate change than people from other countries. A Pew Research survey from last year, for example, found that the United States ranked among the bottom in a list of 14 developed countries in terms of its citizens believing global climate change is a major threat to their country. Facebook says it does downrank, or reduce the spread, of climate change content that third-party fact checkers have labeled as false, and says we take action against pages, groups or accounts that regularly share false claims about climate science. We work with a global network of over 80 independent fact-checking organizations who review and rate content, including climate content, in more than 60 languages, the company said in blog post Monday. When they rate content as false, we add a warning label and move it lower in News Feed so fewer people see it. We dont allow ads that have been rated by one of our fact-checking partners. But it doesnt outright remove climate change misinformation  something it does do for misinformation about Covid-19, vaccines and elections. Zuckerberg explained that policy to lawmakers in a March hearing. We divide the misinformation into things that could cause imminent physical harm, of which Covid misinformation that might lead someone to get sick ... falls in the category of imminent physical harm, and we take down that content. And then other misinformation are things that are false but may not lead to imminent physical harm, we label and reduce their distribution but leave them up, he said. However, environmental advocates say climate change does indeed present imminent threats to safety. People around the US have faced harm from extreme events just in the last few months with Hurricane Ida and people dying, wildfires across the West and extreme heat in the Northwest, said Kathy Mulvey, accountability campaign director for the Climate & Energy team at the Union of Concerned Scientists. Climate change is not a threat in the future, its a reality in the present.",07/11/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/07/tech/facebook-climate-change-misinformation/index.html
"Koalas are dying from chlamydia, and climate change is making it worse","A silent killer is spreading through Australias koala population, posing a threat that wildlife experts say could wipe out the iconic marsupial across large parts of the country. The culprit is chlamydia, a sexually transmitted bacteria that infects more than 100 million people worldwide annually and can cause infertility in humans if left untreated. For koalas, uncontrolled chlamydia can cause blindness and painful cysts in a animals reproductive tract that may lead to infertility or even death. Worse still, antibiotics used to treat the disease can destroy the delicate gut flora koalas need to consume their staple diet of eucalyptus leaves, leading some to starve to death even after being cured. The disease can also spread quickly. In 2008, there was a very, very low chlamydial prevalence  about 10%  in the koala population in Gunnedah, a rural town in northeast New South Wales, according to Mark Krockenberger, a professor of veterinary pathology at the University of Sydney. By 2015, that figure had risen to as high as 60%. Now, about 85% of that koala population is infected with the disease, Krockenberger said. If you think about it, thats not a viable population anymore because of infertility. Pretty much every female thats infected with chlamydia becomes infertile within a year, maybe two years maximum ... Even if they survive, theyre not breeding, he said. Experts say situations like that in Gunnedah are playing out among koala populations across Australia, threatening populations already vulnerable to worsening bushfires and habitat loss due to deforestation. Scientists are now trialing vaccines against chlamydia to protect the animals. We run a very high risk, if this vaccine strategy doesnt work ... of localized extinctions, Krockenberger said. There are few more emblematic Australian animals than the koala. The gray, fluffy-eared marsupial, which eats leaves from the eucalyptus tree and carries its young in its pouch, can only be found in Australia and is regularly seen in cultural representations of the country. But koalas face a number of threats to their survival. Apart from disease, the marsupials suffer habitat loss and are often attacked by wild dogs and hit by cars. The koala is listed as vulnerable on the International Union for the Conservation of Natures (IUCN) Red List, which catalogs species at risk of extinction. The IUCN says there are between 100,000 and half a million koalas in the wild, but the Australian Koala Foundation says the number is closer to 58,000. Confusion about the size of Australias koala population inspired the government to commit 2 million Australian dollars ($1.47 million) last year to a national koala census to work out where they are and how many are left. The countrys koala population suffered severe losses during the catastrophic bushfires of 2019, which destroyed more than 12 million acres (48,000 squares kilometers) of land across New South Wales alone. The fires killed or displaced nearly 3 billion animals, according to the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). That figure includes more than 60,000 koalas that either died, lost their habitat or suffered injury, trauma, smoke inhalation and heat stress from the flames. In mid-2021, an Australian government report on the conservation status of koalas recommended the animals status be changed to endangered in Queensland, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, as a result of the rapid population decline in those areas. In some regions, the report found populations had almost halved over just 20 years. The Australian government is drafting a National Recovery Plan for the Koala which will be reviewed in December 2021 before potentially becoming law in 2022. But Deborah Tabart, chairman of the Australian Koala Foundation, says much more needs to be done to protect koalas and their habitat across the entire country, warning the marsupials could be wiped out within three generations. We want a Koala Protection Act, she said. If you really are serious about protecting this species you would have legislation that is effective and that means protecting the trees, she said. Campaigners say it would be akin to the Bald Eagle Act in the United States that protects the countrys national emblem from threats to its population and habitat. When faced with the threats to the koalas habitat and food supply, chlamydia might seem like a secondary issue. But with numbers dwindling, experts said reproduction has never been more important. There are two varieties of chlamydia in Australian koalas, one of which, chlamydia pecorum, is almost entirely responsible for the most severe cases of the disease in the population. A paper published in September 2020 in FEMS Microbiology Reviews said the more dangerous strain of chlamydia may have originated in domestic livestock brought to Australia by European colonizers in the 19th century. The disease spreads in koala populations through reproduction and social behavior connected to mating, though joeys  baby koalas  can catch the disease from their mothers. According to the University of Sydney, infection rates in some populations of mainland koalas in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria can be as high as 100%, rendering them entirely infertile. Highlighting the diseases lethal potential, a study in the Journal of Applied Ecology in March 2018 found that of 291 koalas examined over four years, 18% had died of chlamydia or related complications. Disease was the second highest cause of death, after animal attacks. The climate crisis has made Australia more vulnerable to devastating bushfires, such as those seen in 2019, as well as drought and heatwaves. Its also making koalas more susceptible to disease. According to Australias leading scientific body, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), the country has already warmed by about 1.44 degrees on average since 1910. The Australian government report said when the marsupials are exposed to unusually stressful environmental conditions, including hot weather, drought, habitat loss and fragmentation, chlamydia spreads more quickly through their population. Experts say they have witnessed similar rapid explosions of disease in the wild. Krockenberger said in his Gunnedah sample population, a series of heatwaves and droughts in 2009 and 2010 preceded a doubling of chlamydia cases. Peter Timms, professor of microbiology at University of Sunshine Coast in Australia, said once koalas stress hormones rise due to environmental problems, infections often progress from a relatively minor problem to one that is more serious. He said a combination of habitat loss and climate change is causing koalas to be chronically stressed, depressing their immune systems. All that leads to poor chlamydia response. It gets them from low grade chlamydia infections to more serious disease, he said. Thats what were doing to them. And were doing it on all fronts. But help could be on the way for Australias koalas. A chlamydia vaccine, developed by researcher Timms over the past decade, is being tested among the countrys koala population as a way to protect the animals from serious infections. Control trials are ongoing to test the effectiveness of the vaccine on small groups of koalas  often about 20 or 30 at a time, Timms said. The current trial is the largest yet, involving 400 koalas. Some koalas are vaccinated when they are brought to veterinary hospitals with complaints other than chlamydia, while others are given the shot as part of coexisting conservation efforts, he added. We know the vaccine can reduce the infection rate, Timms said. It doesnt reduce it to zero. There are no vaccines that do that, but it quashes the infection load way down. He said while it is hoped the process will reduce the infection rate, it is hard to monitor the spread of chlamydia in a wild population. University of Sydneys Krockenberger, who is involved in a separate vaccine trial, said the purpose of the drug isnt to reverse the progress of the disease in individual koalas. Once theyre chronically infected, theyre often able to live reasonably happily, they just cant breed, he said. He said instead the hope is that by reducing the levels of infectiousness in koalas with chlamydia, researchers will be able to prevent the disease from spreading to new hosts and thereby maintain a breeding population. We also hope that the unaffected animals, when theyre vaccinated, are more resistant to picking up the infection, he said. Timms said once the vaccine is proved to be safe and effective, he hopes to roll it out to wildlife hospitals around Australia to vaccinate any koalas who come through their doors. He said that people often ask him how he is going to vaccinate the last koala in the last tree for chlamydia, to which Timms responds hes not even going to try. All he can do is try to save as much of the population as possible. After all, these are wild animals, he said.",07/11/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/06/australia/australia-koala-chlamydia-intl-dst-hnk/index.html
New high-resolution climate model predicts more extreme weather events in the future,"A first-of-its-kind study uses a new high-resolution climate model to highlight local climate-fueled extreme weather risks decades in advance  and the results arent good. The UK Met Office leveraged its 2.2 km resolution UK Climate Projection model to analyze future rainfall events. It is the first time researchers have used a climate model at a resolution on a par with operational weather models for national climate scenarios. Researchers found through the high-resolution model that impacts of extreme rainfall could be more frequent and severe due to climate change than had previously been thought. The study comes as global leaders convene in Glasgow, Scotland, for COP26 to discuss strategies for curbing greenhouse gas emissions in hopes of slowing human-induced warming, which is increasing at an alarming rate. The study narrows in on the COP26s host city, as well as London. It shows the number of days with 30 mm of rain or more per hour (when the United Kingdom issues flash flood warnings) is 3.5 times more likely in Glasgow by the year 2070 when compared to 1990, if warming runs unchecked and the global temperature reaches 3 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and 2.5 times more likely in London. Researchers also calculated the odds of 80 mm of rain or more within 24 hours in Glasgow to be 4.5 times as likely under the same scenario. They attributed this to more frequent, slower-moving and more moisture-rich storm systems impacting the UK becoming more commonplace in the decades to come due to a warming planet. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says the planets temperature has reached nearly 1.2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and warns anything above 1.5 degrees Celsius will have detrimental impacts. Professor Peter Scott, science fellow in climate attribution at the Met Office Hadley Centre, warns that climate change is no longer just an issue about the future. And with it comes a mixed bag of dangerous weather. Within the last two years alone, the world has witnessed events such as: Extreme weather events are indeed nothing new. However, these events are becoming more frequent and intense, and every continent and country around the globe is beginning to see the fingerprint of climate change. The IPCCs August AR6 report sheds light on this by definitively linking the number of weather and climate extremes to greenhouse gas emissions and warming temperatures. The main culprit for increased emissions and temperatures is the electricity sector. Though climate change studies may sound bleak, lead author of AR6 and professor of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology, Dr. Kim Cobb, tells CNN that all is not lost. Cobb says if we enact emissions reductions this decade, we can limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius and mitigate climate-fueled extreme weather impacts by the turn of the century, but action is needed immediately. The novel UKCP model currently only runs projections for the UK. But in theory, it could be applied to other regions of the world depending on computing capacity and data observations to help decision makers develop more strategic actions against climate change.",08/11/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/07/weather/weather-extreme-rainfall-climate-change/index.html
Tuvalu minister stands knee-deep in the sea to film COP26 speech to show climate change,"Tuvalus foreign minister has given a speech to the United Nations climate conference in Glasgow standing knee-deep in seawater to show how his low-lying Pacific island nation is on the front line of climate change. Images of Simon Kofe standing in a suit and tie at a lectern set up in the sea, with his trouser legs rolled up, have been shared widely on social media, drawing attention to Tuvalus struggle against rising sea levels. The statement juxtaposes the COP26 setting with the real-life situations faced in Tuvalu due to the impacts of climate change and sea level rise and highlights the bold action Tuvalu is taking to address the very pressing issues of human mobility under climate change, Kofe said of his video message to the conference. The video was shot by public broadcaster TVBC at the far end of Fongafale, the main islet of the capital Funafuti, a government official said. It is due to be shown at the climate summit on Tuesday and comes as regional leaders push for more aggressive action to limit the impact of climate change. Many big polluters have vowed to intensify their carbon cuts over coming decades with some aiming for net zero carbon emissions by 2050. But Pacific Island leaders have demanded immediate action, pointing out that the very survival of their low-lying countries is at stake.",08/11/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/08/world/tuvalu-minister-climate-crisis-intl-hnk/index.html
First images from NASA satellite which tracks climate changes released,"NASA has released the first snapshots of Earth taken with its new highly sensitive satellite which is designed to capture high-resolution images of the planet and help track the impacts of climate change. NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) have been collecting images of our planet using satellites since 1972. The missions most recent satellite, Landsat 9, launched in September this year, is equipped with two instruments that capture imagery and together provide experts with data about crop health, irrigation use, water quality, wildfire severity, deforestation, glacial retreat and, urban expansion. The Operational Land Imager 2 (OLI-2) detects visible, near-infrared and shortwave-infrared light in nine wavelengths, the combination of which can give experts more information about things beyond what the human eye can observe, like the health of vegetation, or the strength of a wildfire. The satellites other instrument, Thermal Infrared Sensor 2 (TIRS-2), observes thermal radiation in two wavelengths to measure Earths surface temperatures and its changes, and can help experts track plant health. Landsat 9s first images capture critical observations about our changing planet and will advance this joint mission of NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey that provides critical data about Earths landscapes and coastlines seen from space, NASA administrator Bill Nelson said in a statement. This program has the proven power to not only improve lives but also save lives. NASA will continue to work with USGS to strengthen and improve accessibility to Landsat data so decision makers in America  and around the world  better understand the devastation of the climate crisis, manage agricultural practices, preserve precious resources and respond more effectively to natural disasters. The first pictures show locations around the US, including Detroit in Michigan beside Lake St Clair, the intersection of cities and beaches on the changing Florida coastline, and observations from Navajo Country in Arizona that will add to the wealth of data helping us monitor crop health and manage irrigation water, NASA said. The snapshots also provide data about the changing landscapes of more of the worlds crucial habitats, including the Himalayas in High Mountain Asia and the coastal islands and shorelines of northern Australia. Landsat 9 has several improvements on its predecessors: It transmits data with higher radiometric resolution back down to Earth, allowing it to detect more subtle differences over darker areas like water or dense forests. Landsat 9 can differentiate some 16,000 shades of a given wavelength color, while Landsat 7, the satellite being replaced, detects only 256. First light is a big milestone for Landsat users  its the first chance to really see the kind of quality that Landsat 9 provides. And they look fantastic, said Jeff Masek NASAs Landsat 9 project scientist at Goddard Space Flight Center. Landsat 8 will remain in orbit, and together, the two satellites will report on changes to Earth every eight days.",09/11/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/09/world/nasa-images-climate-intl-scli-scn/index.html
China and India among 22 nations calling for key section to be cut from COP26 agreement,"After 11 days of climate talks that have included progress on protecting forests, phasing out coal and transitioning to electric cars, the future of our planet has boiled down to one key thing: whos going to pay for the mess were in? On Thursday afternoon, the eve of the final day of COP26, huge gaps remain between what different countries want on key issues, including how ambitious the world should be in slashing greenhouse gas emissions, all part of what climate folks call mitigation. In what has been the fiercest opposition to the summits draft agreement published Wednesday, Bolivias chief negotiator Diego Pacheco said his country and 21 other allied nations  including major emitters like China, India and Saudi Arabia  would oppose the entire section on climate change mitigation. China, India and Saudi Arabia are all part of the Like-Minded Developing Countries group Pacheco was speaking for. None have replied to CNNs request for comment on their stance. That section contains all of the agreements language around reducing emissions, including the recognition that the world should aim to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, which is what scientists say is necessary to avert the worst climate impacts. The countries biggest point of contention, Pacheco said, was urging everyone to ratchet up their ambitions on emissions by the end of 2022, for COP27. He argued developing nations should not have the same targets as rich ones who have had a greater historical role in the climate crisis. And he accused rich nations of trying to transfer responsibility to the Global South. History matters and history is very important to understand and to put in the context in the discussion on ambition, he said. He added that it would be impossible for many countries in the group to achieve net-zero emissions by mid-century. The issue at the heart of this sentiment is money. He made clear that making such a transition would be impossible if rich nations didnt start paying their fair share  including for developing countries to adapt to the impacts of the crisis. Developing nations have repeatedly complained about so-called climate finance this week, and it and has emerged as the biggest sticking point stalling the talks. Catherine Abreu, founder of the non-profit Destination Zero, which works on climate justice issues, said that Bolivias announcement was essentially a negotiation tactic and the underlying issue was more to do with demands for more funds. The draft of the text was so mitigation focused, so I think that announcement was a play, Abreau told CNN, saying that the countries message meant other parts of the agreement would get held hostage. The suggestion to delete the mitigation section is clearly a punch in the face of people suffering from the climate crisis, said Teresa Anderson, a spokesperson for Climate Action Network. Frans Timmermans, the EU Commissions vice president, ridiculed the call as illogical, saying theres no amount of money on the planet that could develop adaptation to withstand the extreme temperature rise that would come if mitigation were scrapped. In a conference that is trying desperately to close gaps, the most important gap is really the one between what humans are willing to do and whats actually required to avert catastrophic climate change. A report published this week by Climate Action Tracker found that even with all the pledges made at COP26, the world is on track for 2.4 degrees of warming. Closing that gap will require deep and sustained cuts to greenhouse gas emissions over this decade, the latest UN climate science report showed. But that costs money, and there is good reason for developing nations to be dissatisfied. More developing countries are on the frontlines of climate change than wealthy ones, and they collectively have had a much smaller role in creating this crisis. And the money already promised hasnt even flowed in full. Rich countries agreed more than 10 years ago to transfer $100 billion a year to developing nations to help their transformation to low-carbon economies and to adapt to the climate crisis. Adaptation can involve anything from building sea walls to prevent flooding, to moving communities back from the coast and retrofitting homes to netter withstand extreme weather events. Not only has the rich world failed to deliver the $100 billion by the 2020 deadline, developing nations say its nowhere near enough in the first place. They also want a 50-50 split between mitigation  measures to reduce emissions  and adaptation. Far more money has flowed to measures focused on cutting emissions. On top of the money for adaptation, developing countries want new systems to pay for loss and damage, which essentially involves wealthy countries being held financially liable for the impacts of the climate crisis. Its the idea behind the concept of climate reparations. A senior US official said one idea being considered is funding the Santiago Network, a UN body set up to give technical assistance to countries trying to rebuild from the impacts of the climate crisis. But the US is otherwise closed to the idea of a new loss-and-damage fund, which is what many developing nations want. The European Union has said the same thing. There is growing anger, too, towards the United States. A representative of the Climate Vulnerable Forum  a group of around 50 nations  said Thursday that the Biden administration was under-delivering on finance. He praised Nicola Sturgeon, the leader of Scotland, the only country that has committed any money to a loss and damage fund, with 2 million Scottish pounds ($2.7 million). Its a small but symbolic figure that shows such a fund may be possible. The true leader that has emerged here at COP26 is not a party to the convention. She is our host, she is the First Minister of Scotland, Saleemul Huq, the forums expert advisory chair told journalists. Just before the COP started she put a million pounds of Scottish money on the table for a new fund on loss and damage and challenged all the other leaders to match it. Yesterday, she doubled the amount. So she is the true leader who is putting money on the table for loss and damage. The US is giving us zero dollars. Europe is giving us zero euros. But Scotland has given us two million. Behind him was sign picturing Biden with the message Has the US kept its $100 billion promise? NOPE! European lawmaker Bas Eickhout from the Netherlands said that US was not showing flexibility on several matters, and that its fair share on funding for the developing world would be closer to $40 billion than the $11.4 billion pledged. The developing countries are coming here with a couple of demands, and climate finance and loss and damage are the most important, he told CNN. If the US is going to say no to everything, that will be a problem. And this will feed into what China wants. The more there is a battle between developing countries and the developed countries, the more China can sit back and relax. Eickhout added: You cant say no to everything. And if you want a review mechanism on accelerating mitigation, then of course, the question will be OK, but is finance developing? And if you then dont deliver on loss and damage, and you havent delivered your $100 billion, well what are we getting in return? Underpinning all of this is humans continued use of fossil fuels. Two sources familiar with the negotiations told CNN that Saudi Arabia, Russia, China and Australia were opposed to an article in the draft agreement calling for the phaseout of coal and fossil fuel subsidies. Any reference to fossil fuels in the agreement would be a first and a breakthrough for the COP climate process. Saudi Arabia is one of the worlds biggest oil producers, Australia is a major coal producer, and Russia is a big producer of coal, oil and gas. China is the worlds biggest producer and consumer of coal. None of those countries have responded to CNNs request for comment. China is also unlikely to support the language on fossil fuels, the sources told CNN. Climate envoy Xie Zhenhua was asked by reporters on Wednesday whether it would support the section, but he did not answer directly and simply listed all of Chinas plans for coal and finance. Saudi Arabias Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman Al-Saud said on Wednesday that the world should recognize the diversity of climate solutions ... without any bias towards or against any particular source of energy. Reuters reported that he responded to accusations that his country was blocking process as lies and fabrications.",11/11/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/11/world/china-india-bolivia-cop26-climate-intl/index.html
COP26 climate deal includes historic reference to fossil fuels but doesn? meet urgency of the crisis,"Nearly 200 nations reached a climate agreement on Saturday at COP26 with an unprecedented reference to the role of fossil fuels in the climate crisis, even after an 11th-hour objection from India that watered down the language around reducing the use of coal. The COP process has tried and failed for years to include an acknowledgment that the climate crisis has been caused by the burning of fossil fuels. Coal is the single biggest source of greenhouse gases and phasing it out was a key priority of COP26 President Alok Sharma. But despite that progress, the text doesnt reflect the urgency expressed by international scientists in their code red for humanity climate report published in August. Rather, it defers more action on reducing fossil fuel emissions to next year. The UNs Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reported the world needs to roughly halve emissions over the next decade. Visibly teary after a long two weeks, and following marathon talks that went late into the night Friday, Sharma formalized the agreement with strikes of a gavel. He orally made Indias requested amendment, changing the text to a phasing down of coal as opposed to a phasing out. The text also includes language around moving away from fossil fuel subsidies. Sharma earlier told delegates he was infinitely grateful for keeping 1.5 alive, referring to his overarching goal to contain global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Scientists say that limit is critical to avoid worsening impacts of the climate crisis and to steer away from catastrophic climate change. At the center of the agreement is a request for countries to come to the COP27 talks in Egypt at the end of next year with updated plans for slashing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, putting accelerated pressure on nations to keep enhancing their ambitions. Before this agreement, countries were required to do that by 2025. Whether that part of the agreement is successful will only become clear at the Egypt meeting, where countries will either show that they have stepped up their goals or wont. Hopes were high going into COP26 that the meeting would result in meaningful action, after the UNs climate science report and extreme weather events throughout the Northern Hemisphere this summer sounded the alarm that climate change was happening faster that even scientists had previously understood. Some scientists say that while there were breakthroughs in the COP26 deal, the full outcome did not meet the urgency of the moment. A lot of people working on climate change issues are really frustrated and even angry about the lack of real strength in the decisions, said Bill Hare, CEO & senior scientist at non-profit Climate Analytics. We are seeing progress moving forward. Its not fast enough  but its not slow enough to give up. A recent analysis by Climate Action Tracker found that even with all the new emissions pledges announced ahead of COP26, the world is on track for 2.4 degrees of warming. And on coal, questions are being raised over whether the COP26 presidency should have adopted the unilateral change to the text by India. Swiss Environment Minister Simonetta Sommaruga complained that the process to amend language on fossil fuels at the last minute was not transparent enough. We dont need to phase down but to phase out coal and fossil fuel subsidies, said Sommaruga, who represents the Environmental Integrity Group, which includes six parties to the UN climate change agency. She added that the EIG chose not to stand in the way of an agreement, but that the group was disappointed. This will not bring us closer to 1.5 but make it more difficult to reach it, Sommaruga said. After hearing complaints from climate-vulnerable countries about the last-minute change, Sharma apologized. May I just say to all delegates I apologize for the way this process has unfolded and I am deeply sorry, Sharma said before he slammed the gavel. Sharma later told reporters he canvassed delegates in the room to see if the language change on coal would be acceptable. He said he was sorry the original language was dropped, but we do have language on coal  and I think that is a start. After the meeting adjourned, focus turned to next steps and whether the Glasgow agreement would lead to meaningful action. When asked how COP puts pressure on countries to reduce their emissions, US climate envoy John Kerry said that the only way pressure is exerted is the acceptance of moral and public responsibility for actions. He said that what compels countries is the public scrutiny that holds you accountable to your own promises. Thats a huge level of accountability, frankly, Kerry said. Beyond fossil fuels, there was a sharp divide between developed and developing nations all week over funding to adapt to the climate crisis, but also the idea of setting up a new loss and damage fund which would have seen wealthy nations pay for climate crisis impacts in more vulnerable countries. There was progress on adaptation money  a doubling of finance by 2025 from 2019 levels. But firm language on a loss-and-damage fund was ultimately dropped. A US official told CNN the country was opposed to it, while a source told CNN the EU was also resisting. An EU spokesperson declined to comment. We support loss and damage but what we think is in the next few years, we have to work through what is this all about ... how much money is needed for what, whats the legality of it, you know? Kerry said in a news conference. But we also remain always thoughtful about the issue of liability, and to where this goes, Kerry said. Seve Paeniu, climate envoy for Tuvalu  a low-lying atoll nation under threat of sea level rise  told journalists he was disappointed that the loss-and-damage fund wasnt agreed on. First of all, little countries made our voices heard, but in a negotiation room like this, youve got the big countries. So its a case of take-it-or-leave-it kind of deal, he said. So there was no other option left for us. We just want to work with this and are hopeful that some outcome would come out of this dialogue. He also said that developed nations have failed to deliver on finance before, but that he wanted to remain optimistic. Theres a lot of commitment to take action. So between now the next COP, countries just need to deliver on those commitments. So theres a lot of work now, he said. I think Glasgow has provided a platform for ambition. The challenge now is for countries to actually deliver on those. Teresa Anderson, climate policy coordinator for ActionAid International, was less optimistic. This outcome is an insult to the millions of people whose lives are being torn apart by the climate crisis, said Andersen, adding that the wealthy countries most responsible for our warming world  particularly the United States  have blocked their ears and hung those most impacted out to dry.",13/11/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/13/world/cop26-agreement-final-climate-intl/index.html
Was COP26 successful? Here? how climate summits make a difference,"At the opening of the COP26 summit in Glasgow, US President Joe Biden called the climate crisis an existential threat to human existence as we know it. So let this be the moment that we answer historys call here in Glasgow, Biden told a room full of leaders, ministers and climate negotiators from around the world. In a shiny ceremony featuring Indigenous speakers, British royals and heart-breaking messages from children, other leaders too spoke about big plans to save the future, promising cooperation, compromise and goodwill. Fast forward two weeks and delegates from different countries were at loggerheads with each other, with divisions running along the usual lines: Major coal, oil and gas producing countries were resisting language on fossil fuels that smaller climate-vulnerable nations wanted. Developing countries called for more financial support, but the rich nations they appealed to wouldnt budge on how much they were willing to pay. If the success of an international agreement can be measured in its ability to disappoint everyone equally, the Glasgow accord could be seen as a triumph, Hannah Cloke, professor of hydrology at the University of Reading, said in a statement. From a scientific point of view, we are back in the position where the science is ever clearer but the politics is still worryingly murky. As the urgency of the climate crisis is better understood now than ever, people are becoming frustrated with the slow pace of political action on climate. Even COP26 President Alok Sharma and UN chief Antonio Guterres have said nations needs to be even more ambitious than they were at Glasgow. The latest science shows that the world needs to nearly halve greenhouse gas emissions over this decade alone to have any chance of containing global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Thats to prevent worsening climate change impacts and to steer the world away from climate catastrophe. There are few diplomatic meetings in the world as painful as the Conference of the Parties, or COPs, on climate. They require consensus of nearly 200 nations  some of them are rich, others are poor. Some are petrostates, others are already carbon neutral. Negotiations get notoriously ugly towards the end. There are always complaints from smaller nations of bullying by bigger ones. Its a wonder they can decide on anything at all. It takes just one country to oppose a measure to see it on the cutting room floor. If that country happens to be big and powerful, thats all the more likely. It only took one country, for example  India  to fiercely resist language about phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsidies for it to be watered down to a phasing down. Despite Bidens opening pleas, the US delegation was among those opposing the establishment of a new loss and damage fund that would involve wealthier countries paying for the impacts of climate change in the most vulnerable nations  money that might help people rebuild homes after a destructive flood or typhoon. The spirit of the fund would be to hold developed nations financially accountable for their historically larger role in the climate crisis. A US official told CNN the country was opposed to a loss-and-damage fund. On Saturday, US climate envoy John Kerry told reporters the US supports such a fund in principle, but said there werent enough details  particularly around liability  for the US to back the deal outright. A source familiar with the negotiations told CNN the EU also resisted it, and an EU spokesperson declined to comment. Unsurprisingly, there was only a vague reference to scaling up money and no actual fund, in what was a huge disappointment for countries on the front lines of the climate crisis. Teresa Anderson, climate policy coordinator at ActionAid International said the outcome of the summit was an insult to the millions of people whose lives are being torn apart by the climate crisis. There were huge expectations that COP26 would finally deliver real support for the communities, farmers, women and girls who need to recover and rebuild in the aftermath of climate disasters ... but the wealthy countries most responsible for our warming world  particularly the US  have blocked their ears and hung those most impacted out to dry. But none of these examples mean that COP is useless or ineffective. Quite the contrary. Developing countries were ultimately left empty handed without a loss-and-damage fund, but Lola Vallejo, climate program director at the policy research institute IDDRI, said the fact that the issue received so much attention is an important win on a taboo. You can say its starting to crack. Now theres a broader dialogue, Vallejo said. Its a very sensitive question for developed countries, because the key question behind this is the liability question ... am I going to get sued for the amount of emissions? And buried in the bad news of watered-down language on fossil fuels, there was at least some progress: none of the 25 COPs before Glasgow had even made mention of the role of fossil fuels in the human-made climate crisis. (They are by far the biggest source of greenhouse gases.) Thats despite the fact that the link between the two has been known since the 19th century. Scientists rang the alarm on how serious a problem this was in the 1980s. While the final language of the Glasgow Pact does not reflect the sense of emergency needed to really make movement on the climate crisis, its a sign that the usual fossil fuel stronghold nations may be willing to bend. A shortfall of the COP process is a lack of accountability. Even when there is big progress, like there was in the 2015 Paris Agreement, many countries are under-delivering on their promises, with very little recourse. Australia, for example, updated its emissions plans last year ahead of the deadline established by the Paris Agreement. It technically followed the rules but it didnt actually increase its ambition, which is the entire point of the updates. The strength in these events, essentially, is less about the law and more about peer pressure. A good example is a statement in the first week that declared an end to financing fossil fuel projects abroad. It attracted more than 20 nations at first, by the end it was 34. France wasnt a signatory on the declaration on ending fossil fuel financing abroad, they were planning to revise this next year, Vallejo said. But because of the pressure and the NGOs kind of calling them out, France changed its mind and signed this on the last day of COP. COP is like having a flashlight in your face, because theres so much media attention and activism around, Vallejo said. Bob Ward, a climate policy and communications expert at the London School of Economics, said that while the process is complicated and slow, a meeting that includes the whole world is necessary. There is no alternative to multilateral negotiations. Perhaps most significant change in Glasgow was an article that requests countries to come to COP27 next year in Egypt with updated plans to slash emissions. Under the Paris Agreement, they would only have been obliged to do that by 2025. In other words, this should accelerate action by three years. Whether Glasgow was a success will depend on if countries like Australia actually come to COP27 with more ambitious plans. Where climate accountability may take place is the worlds national courts. Once a country ratifies a treaty like the Paris Agreement  as most have now done  it becomes legally binding. And while countries are not suing each other in international courts, people can sue their own government or businesses in their own countries for lack of action on the climate crisis. Being armed with agreements like Paris helps, and there have been successful challenges already. The German Supreme Court ruled in April on a case centered around the human rights of young people that the governments climate target wasnt sufficient to meet Germanys obligations under the Paris accord. The German government came up with new climate goals in less than a week after the defeat. Thats a win from COP. In 2018, a court in The Hague ordered the Netherlands to cut greenhouse gas emission faster than it previously planned, to protect its citizens from climate change. The ruling forced the government to put a number of large construction projects on hold and quickly adopt new goals in order to be in line with the Paris Agreement. Lawsuits can tackle climate change to some degree, but the ultimate solution is getting big emitters to decarbonize. Were only going to stop global warming when we get to zero global emissions. That means everybody has to get there, Ward said. The rich countries have to lead the way, but there is no scenario in which any major country cannot get to zero emissions and climate change will be dealt with. To get everyone on the same page requires huge compromises, which can be difficult when negotiators from oil-dependent nations face off with those from small islands that are literally sinking as sea level rises. One of the most memorable moments from COP26 was when Tuvalus foreign minister, Simon Kofe, delivered his speech to the conference in a video, standing knee-deep in seawater to show how his low-lying Pacific island nation is already being hit by the climate crisis. This is why COPs are so important, said Vallejo. It provides this moment where the countries that are most vulnerable can share the stage with the countries that have a historical responsibility to respond to climate change, she said. Usually, the big decisions get taken in the G7 or the G20. And here, you have a forum just focusing on climate issues, and which is based on principles of transparency and inclusiveness. And I think thats precisely why we still need them.",15/11/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/14/world/does-cop26-matter-for-climate-intl/index.html
Senior Pentagon official warns the US military is ?ot ready?for climate change,"A senior Pentagon official warned the US military is not ready to handle climate change, a national security issue that touches nearly every aspect of Defense Department planning. We are not where we should be, and now is beyond the time when we need to get in front of that challenge, Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks told CNN. Beyond rising sea levels and extreme weather, climate change has opened up new areas of strategic competition like the Arctic and intensified the competition for scarce resources, such as the raw materials required to make the lithium-ion batteries crucial to electric vehicles. Its something like $750 billion of investment worldwide going on in lithium-ion batteries, Hicks said. The challenge is most of that is happening in China. They dominate that supply chain. Its a significant national security challenge for us. Hicks, the first woman to hold the Pentagons number two position, leads the militarys different efforts on climate change. On a recent two-day trip to Michigan, Connecticut and Rhode Island, Hicks saw work on the first generation of electric military vehicles, including an electric light reconnaissance vehicle at GM Defense. As the civilian automotive industry goes green, the Pentagon will follow. If we dont follow and be part of the solution, we will be left behind, Hicks said, and our vehicle fleets wont be able to be supported. But electric military vehicles pose their own set of challenges. Although an electric vehicle can be much quieter and emit less of a heat signature  critical advantages on a battlefield  it also needs to be recharged somehow. Refueling a gas vehicle requires supply lines to bring in the fuel, but it is still faster and more efficient than recharging an electric vehicle on a battlefield. The temporary solution, Hicks says, is hybrid tactical vehicles. Its an interim solution to bridge the current gas vehicle fleet and the future electric fleet. I do see that future. Its not right around the corner, but we are definitely moving in that direction, said Hicks. We have to. The fight against climate change has been a cornerstone of the Biden administrations agenda. In his first week in office, President Joe Biden signed an executive order that put the climate crisis at the center of foreign policy and national security. There is little time left to avoid setting the world on a dangerous, potentially catastrophic, climate trajectory, Biden wrote in the order. The number of personnel days for National Guard members fighting wildfires in the Western United States has increased more than tenfold, from about 14,000 five years ago to 176,000 this year. Climate change will be folded into the updated National Defense Strategy, due next year. In last years budget, the Defense Department devoted $617 million to preparing for climate change and mitigating its effects. But this pales in comparison with the damage from extreme weather events. Two hurricanes  Michael in 2018 and Sally in 2020  caused $4 billion in damage at Tyndall Air Force Base and Pensacola Naval Air Station in Florida, according to a Department of Defense report. Hurricane Florence in 2018 caused about $3.5 billion in damages and repairs at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, and flooding at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska caused about $500 million in damages in 2019, the report said. But the Defense Department still lacks a thorough understanding of the threat to its roughly 5,000 military facilities around the world. Last year, the department released its DoD Climate Assessment Tool to better comprehend the hazards of climate change based on historical data and future assessments. The department will use the tool to look at 1,400 facilities worldwide. Once we start to understand that we cant opt out of climate change in anything that we do - its just a fact, a reality of how we think about the future  then we can start to really get in front of and be productive on climate change, said Hicks. For all of the Defense Departments efforts related to climate change, Hicks knows it can play only a small part in addressing the huge challenge. The Defense Department did not send a top representative to the recent COP26 conference on climate in Glasgow, Scotland. But Hicks welcomed the conference as an opportunity for key players to work together on an issue bigger than any one nation. The United States can do a lot to help this world problem,she said, but it cant do it alone.",20/11/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/20/politics/pentagon-climate-change-warning/index.html
"British people are more concerned than ever about climate, ahead of Covid and Brexit, poll shows","People in the United Kingdom think that climate change, pollution and the environment are together the most important issues they face, well ahead of the pandemic, the impacts of Brexit and the countrys troubled National Health Service, according to a poll from Ipsos MORI published on Wednesday. The poll showed the highest level of concern about the climate crisis since the agency began polling in 1988. Ipsos MORI publishes its poll monthly, and Novembers was carried out over a week during the COP26 climate conference. The event was held in Glasgow, Scotland, and received extensive national media coverage. Around 40% of people surveyed said climate change, pollution and the environment were among their top three concerns. The pandemic came second at 27% and Brexit was third, with 22%. Ipsos MORI interviewed more than 1,000 adults, who answered spontaneously and were not prompted with options as answers. Climate concern was 16 percentage points higher in November than October, when people expressed greater concern about Brexit, the pandemic and the economy. While there was a clear bump in interest during the COP26 conference, there has been longterm growth in concern about climate over the past decade, which has been confirmed by other polls, including from YouGov. The Ipsos MORI poll showed was a fairly even distribution of climate concern across age groups, genders and political affiliation. [Its] very encouraging that climate change is no longer a preoccupation reserved to the young and the liberal, Gabriela Jiga-Boy, a senior lecturer in psychology at the University of Swansea, told CNN. It means that British society may not be very divided regarding climate change. This is very important in these times, when we discuss a lot about real or false polarization on issues, and we often exaggerate how polarized people actually are. Men and women considered the climate crisis a top issue almost equally, at 40% and 41%, respectively, the poll showed. And supporters of the center-right Conservative Party and center-left Labour Party were equal in their concern for climate issues. In the age group of 55 and over, 47% of people said it was a top issue. For the 35 to 54 age group, it was 43%. Among those 18 to 34 years old, just 27% said the same, though that age group was less likely to say they were worried about any particular issue. Ralitsa Hiteva, a senior research fellow in the Science Policy Research Unit at the University of Sussex Business School, said that climate change is now a top priority among a majority of groups because the topic is becoming personal. Thats also true for how policies like net-zero emissions targets may affect them. Dozens of countries have set a net-zero emissions goal for mid-century, for which they plan to drastically reduce greenhouse emissions and capture excess, through actions like planing trees or using technology to remove carbon from fossil fuels. Such technology isnt fully developed and remains controversial. We are seeing that people are personally affected by things related to both the target for net zero, and are seeing and experiencing the impact of climate change  from large wildfires to the rapid increases of the price of energy, Hiteva told CNN in an email. While concern about the climate crisis is fairly even among age groups, support for different types of climate action is more divisive. Older people are more inclined to pay for investment in infrastructure to improve the experience of future generations, she said, adding that younger adults were less likely to do so. The only way for this to translate into action is to use the momentum of the moment and engage people with re-imagining how infrastructure investment can be designed and used in an innovative way which is not only kinder to the environment but is also more inclusive and fairer.",24/11/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/23/uk/climate-uk-concern-poll-ipsos-mori-gbr-intl/index.html
"The Arctic Ocean began warming decades earlier than previously thought, new research shows","The Arctic Ocean has been warming since the onset of the 20th century, decades earlier than instrument observations would suggest, according to new research. The study, published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances, found that the expansion of warm Atlantic Ocean water flowing into the Arctic, a phenomenon known as Atlantification, has caused Arctic water temperature in the region studied to increase by around 2 degrees Celsius since 1900. Francesco Muschitiello, an author on the study and assistant professor of geography at the University of Cambridge, said the findings were worrisome because the early warming suggests there might be a flaw in the models scientists use to predict how the climate will change. The Arctic Ocean has been warming up for much longer than we previously thought, Muschitiello told CNN. And this is something thats a bit unsettling for many reasons, especially because the climate models that we use to cast projections of future climate change do not really simulate these type of changes. The researchers used marine sediments in the Fram Straight, where the Atlantic meets the Arctic east of Greenland, to reconstruct 800 years of data that paint a longer historical picture of how Atlantic water has flowed into the Arctic. The marine sediments are natural archives, the researchers wrote, which record data on past climate conditions. Researchers found temperature and salinity, the saltiness of ocean water, remained fairly constant up until the 20th century  then they suddenly increased. The reconstructions suggest a substantial increase in the Atlantic Ocean heat and salt transport into the Nordic Sea at the beginning of the 20th century, which is not well simulated by (climate models), Rong Zhang, a senior scientist at NOAAs Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, who was not involved with the study, told CNN. Its important to understand the cause of this rapid Atlantification, as well as the discrepancies between the model simulations and the reconstructions. Muschitiello said its not clear how much of a role, if any, human-caused climate change played in the early Arctic warming, and more research is needed. Were talking about the early 1900s, and by then weve already been supercharging the atmosphere with carbon dioxide, he said. It is possible that the Arctic Ocean is more sensitive to greenhouse gases than previously thought. This will require more research, of course, because we dont have a solid grip on the actual mechanisms behind this early Atlantification. The study notes that changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)  a system of currents that moderates temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere  could have played a role in the Arctic warming. Notably, the AMOC weakened after a period of cooling ended in the mid-1800s in the North Atlantic region, which researchers suggest could have led to rapid Atlantification along the east Fram Strait. A recent study found that the AMOC, often described as a conveyor belt that transports warm water from the tropics and redistributes it northward, is now showing signs of further instability due to human-caused climate change. Scientists have warned that a collapse of the circulation could lead to an abrupt shift in weather patterns across the globe  colder winters in Europe, changes to monsoons and potentially permanent drought in West Africa. The rapidly warming temperatures in the Arctic have caused sea ice to melt, which in turn causes more warming  while bright white sea ice reflects the suns energy, dark ocean absorbs the energy as heat. James E. Overland, NOAA Arctic scientist based at NOAA Pacific Marine Environmental Lab in Seattle, said such long-term changes in the North Atlantic, coupled with recent loss of sea ice in the Arctic, threatens marine ecosystems. Loss of sea ice and ocean currents has shifted the buffer region between the Atlantic and Arctic Ocean to something closer to an arm of the central Atlantic, Overland, who was not involved with the study, told CNN. Important fisheries and marine mammals are vulnerable to ecosystem reorganization from such Atlantification. A recent UN state-of-the-science report on the climate crisis found the Arctic will continue to warm faster than the rest of the planet as long as humans continue to burn fossil fuels and release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. On top of that, Muschitiello said the Arctic Ocean may experience further warming due to Atlantification. When I talk to my students I always try to make them aware that the Arctic is warming very, very quickly, and much faster than any other area on the planet, Muschitiello said. Its very unsettling and very troubling, especially because we still dont have a full understanding of feedbacks at play. Were still slowly getting to know how the whole system works, he said. And my fear is that by the time that we do crack the problem, its going to be too late.",24/11/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/24/us/arctic-ocean-early-warming-climate/index.html
Politicians are failing to deliver climate justice. Lawyers and scientists could do it in court,"There were few memorable moments at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow earlier this month, but a video address by the foreign minister of Tuvalu, speaking in a suit while knee-deep in tropical waters, is a hard one to forget. It was simple but strong message  while negotiators made agreements to delay action, island nations in the Pacific such as Tuvalu are sinking in rising seas, and could be swallowed entirely as soon as the end of this century. There are many opinions on whether COP26 was a success or failure. However, theres one thing that the most climate-vulnerable countries left utterly disappointed about  there was no agreement to get wealthy nations, which are most responsible for the climate crisis, to pay compensation for the havoc that climate change is wreaking on the frontlines of the crisis. The much-anticipated summit did little for climate justice. On Thursday, three young climate activists in the United Kingdom challenged the High Court to hear a case in which they hope to turn that around. They are seeking to sue UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson  as well as his treasurer, Rishi Sunak, and business chief, Kwasi Kwarteng  over what they say is a failure to put real action behind the countrys own net-zero emissions plan. They claim the leaders are violating not only of their right to life as British citizens, but also of their right to family life, which they argue includes their relatives abroad. The judge on Thursday reserved  or delayed  the decision to give it more consideration, in what could be interpreted as the court taking the case seriously. The case was first filed in May but a court refused to hear it on several grounds, including questions over whether a UK court has any influence on the lives of people in other countries. The three activists  Adetola Stephanie Onamade, Marina Tricks and Jerry Amokwandoh, who all in their 20s  and the charity Plan B Earth are trying to challenge that entire concept. The activists have Nigerian and Trinidadian, Mexican, and Ghanaian heritage, respectively, and believe that historical emitters have a duty of care to people, such as their relatives, in the Global South. [The previous court] dismissed the idea that our family life included our family around the world, or our family back home, Amokwandoh told CNN before Thursdays decision. And they were saying that your family can only be limited to the British isles. Its a colonial mindset. Tricks said they are taking particular aim at fossil fuel projects in the pipeline, including a proposed coal mine in northwest England, which is under review, and the exploration of oil in the North Sea. We are ultimately being screwed over by the system, by this government, because of its funding of the climate crisis, Tricks said. Its actively financing extractivist projects that are contaminating our lands, our waters and our air. A UK government spokesperson said: We do not comment on ongoing legal proceedings. This kind of litigation is something the UK government, and many around the world, will have to get used to. In a separate case, a number of activists backed by a group called Paid to Pollute will take Johnsons administration to the High Court on December 8 to block state money flowing into new fossil fuel projects. The group says the UK government spent 13.6 billion on oil and gas subsidies between 2016 and 2020, following the Paris Agreement, which committed the world to try and limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, but preferably 1.5. Most of the money was paid in tax relief for new oil and gas exploration and production, it says. Globally, the number of climate change-related legal cases has more than doubled since 2015, according to the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics. Just over 800 cases were filed between 1986 and 2014, but more than 1,000 have been brought since the year the Paris Agreement was signed, according to its latest report published in July. Were seeing a lot of groups using the courts to try and advance climate action where there might be frustrations with the political processes, said Catherine Higham, coordinator of the Climate Change Laws of the World program at the Grantham Research Institute. The cases were bringing a kind of interplay between court rulings and politics, she said. In a case brought by German youths to the countrys Constitutional Court in April, for example, the court ruled that the government needed to boost its climate plans to fall in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement. That legal decision kicked off more political debate on climate and the government ended up boosting its plans beyond the courts order. We see plaintiffs using the courts to try and advance climate action, but also as a tool to push the boundaries of political debate, she said. And major fossil fuel companies are being targeted by litigation too. A Dutch court in The Hague made a landmark ruling against oil giant Shell in May, ordering the company to slash its emissions by 45% by 2030, from 2019 levels, to be in line with the Paris Agreement. Shell is appealing the decision. That ruling could be truly transformative. It would be very hard for a company such as Shell to reduce its emissions by 45% without transitioning a good deal of its oil to renewable or low-emissions energy sources. Higham says the decision could pave the way for similar court rulings against other major emitters. A similar case against French oil giant Total is being heard in France. One of the ways in which the Shell case differs from others is that rather than looking at compensation, the court gave a forward-looking order about what Shell needs to do  a declaration that what Shell is currently doing is insufficient, she said. While we cant say how other cases, like the one against Total, will ultimately conclude, there is a big possibility that that cases will result in similar judgments against many other companies, or at least, that there will be many more actions building on the foundation that was provided by the Shell case. Climate scientists have long bemoaned the huge gap between science and political action. But for a long time, they were also largely excluded from another arena of power  the court system. Today, courts are increasingly considering science in their climate-related rulings, according to Bill Hare, a senior scientist and CEO of the think tank Climate Analytics. Courts are looking at what the science is saying, theyre given more and more weight to reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Hare said, referring to the landmark UN climate science report published every six to seven years. The most recent one was published in August amid a wave of extreme weather events across the Northern Hemisphere. There is still a huge gap between what countries are putting forward in terms of emissions pledges and whats needed, according to the IPCC science, so thats another dimension to this that the courts will look at, Hare said. I think thats something thats going to be very testing on governments. Weve seen that already in the last 12 to 24 months and it can only grow. Climate scientists are increasingly being called upon to share their expertise in courts of law, and as they get better at being able to make clear links between countries and companies emissions and their impacts  like heatwaves or wildfires  big emitters have less room to hide. This is even happening in transboundary cases. One example is a case by an Austrian activists group called AllRise against Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. The group is petitioning the International Criminal Court to hear the case, in which they say Bolsonaros policies that allowed for the rapid deforestation of the Amazon released emissions that contributed to climate change, causing deaths and real losses and damages to peoples livelihoods. Scientists were able to put an estimate on how much carbon dioxide and methane was emitted from those policies and found it accounted for around 1% of the worlds global greenhouse gases each year. Thats around the same as the UKs total emissions, they wrote in an expert submission to the case. They also found that the amount emitted would lead to more than 180,000 excess heat-related deaths globally before 2100. Thats even if global emissions are cut substantially. Climate change kills people. And the politics of Bolsonaro not only increases emissions, they increases the intensity of heatwaves, and that affects lives of people around the world, and, of course, locally, its destroying livelihoods, said Friederike Otto from the Imperial College of Londons Grantham Institute, who was among the scientists behind the written submission for the case. This kind of environmental destruction, on such a level, you should count as a crime against humanity because it destroys livelihoods on a large scale. The Bolsonaro administration did not immediately reply to CNNs request for comment. Otto also leads the World Weather Attribution project, which is one a group of scientists who use modeling and data analysis to estimate just how much climate change contributed to an extreme weather event. This kind of science is useful in tort law cases, when a court needs to asses a civil wrong that has caused loss or damage. I think its also important in the Bolsonaro example, because you cant hide behind generics anymore, Otto said. Its not some vague future generation that will suffer. Its concrete people here that are losing their livelihoods and concrete dollars that someone had to pay. The Bolsonaro case is truly unique in that litigating internationally on climate issues is difficult. There is no dedicated international court for climate crimes, for example, and even the ICC has its limitations. It can be constrained by its own power politics and some countries have refused to cooperate in cases that implicate them. ClientEarth, a non-profit organization that provides legal services and advice in climate cases, has had several successes, including a 2020 case that led to Poland halting the construction of a coal plant. A lawyer for the group, Sophie Marjanac, told CNN that COP26s failure to set up a scheme to pay compensation for climate impacts was no less than a betrayal. Climate change is inherently unequal: its impacts  such as droughts, heatwaves flooding, and rising seas  are felt most in those countries least responsible. This is clearly a human rights issue, she said. When governments do not take action, litigation will increasingly be used to hold them accountable.",25/11/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/25/world/climate-court-litigation-uk-government-cmd-intl/index.html
Madagascar? food crisis has been blamed on climate change. These scientists say that? wrong,"The UNs World Food Programme and multiple media organizations have been warning that the African island nation of Madagascar is on the brink of the worlds first climate-change-induced famine. But a new study says the human-made climate crisis has had little to do with the current food scarcity in the country. Consecutive years of low rainfall have led to a prolonged drought that has shaken Madagascars food security and has already pushed tens of thousands of people into famine-like conditions. A study by scientists at the World Weather Attribution initiative, an international collaboration led by Imperial College London and the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute, found that a natural variation in the climate was most likely the main reason for the drought. The group said that poverty, poor infrastructure and a high level of dependence on rain for agriculture were also behind the countrys food crisis. Madagascar received only around 60% of its usual average rainfall for two years in a row, the lowest in 30 years. The drought has led to widespread crop failure in the countrys south, and around 1.3 million people nationwide are in need of food assistance, according to the World Food Programme (WFP). The scientists said that they couldnt rule out climate change entirely as contributing to the lower rainfall, but its role, if any, was so small that it was indistinguishable from the countrys historical climate patterns. Instead, the study finds that vulnerability to low rainfall is the main factor behind the food crisis, the study reads. Covid restrictions to limit public health impacts also stopped people from the region going elsewhere in the country to find work, as many people have done at other times. WFP responded to the study by saying the food crisis was the result of a combination of above average temperatures, lower rainfall, crop failures and other vulnerabilities in communities dependent on subsistence agriculture, worsened by the economic impact of Covid-19. The WWA study does not attribute the 2019/2020 droughts solely to human-induced climate change. But it acknowledges that global heating increases vulnerabilities, the organization said in a statement. The UNs Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change report published in August found that Madagascar was projected to see an increase in drought if global warming surpassed 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. It is also predicted to experience a higher intensity of tropical cyclones. The world has already experienced an average temperature rise of around 1.2 degrees Celsius. The WFP wrote that it is concerned that Madagascar and other countries will continue to have food crises if we do not mitigate the climate crisis and enable the vulnerable to adapt and build their resilience. Multiple media organizations, including CNN, had reported the WFPs characterization of the food crisis as driven by the climate crisis. The WWA scientists studied the heavily impacted southwest of the country, analyzing weather records, climate projections and computer simulations to compare the areas current and past climate conditions. The study found the region naturally experiences a high variation in its rain patterns. In todays climate, Madagascar has a 1-in-135 chance of such a drought occurring in any given year, it showed. Nonetheless, Madagascar remains vulnerable to the climate crisis, which is driven primarily from humans use of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas. As greenhouse gas emissions rise, the country is likely to experience increasing extreme weather impacts, including drought. If global temperatures rise further, Madagascar is likely to suffer from stronger tropical cyclones and, in places, possibly more droughts, said Lisa Thalheimer, a postdoctoral research associate at the Center for Policy Research on Energy and the Environment at Princeton University, who took part in the study. Unless carbon emissions are reduced globally, any increase in extreme weather events will compound existing vulnerabilities and particularly harm the poorest people, making it harder for them to cope with compounding shocks like the one we are seeing now. And while the climate crisis may not have played a significant role in this drought, other analyses have shown it has been a major driver in reduced rainfall and drought in places like California and parts of the Middle East. Other scientists involved in the study said the take-home message was to ramp up efforts to adapt to extreme weather events, which are only expected to become more frequent and more destructive the warmer the world gets. What we are seeing with this event in Madagascar shows that in many cases we are not even prepared for todays climate, said Maarten van Aalst, director of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre. Addressing the vulnerability in the region and improving the living conditions of the population remains critical.",01/12/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/12/01/africa/madagascar-climate-food-crisis-attribution-study-intl/index.html
Climate change crisis: Golf courses on borrowed time as Earth? weather patterns become wilder,"The 30 or so golf courses in the Salt Lake County of Utah drink up around nine million gallons of water a day to stay pristine green  thats more than 13 Olympic-sized swimming pools. Managing the turf on golf courses also means using carbon-intensive fertilizers, plenty of mowing and, in many cases, clearing forests or trees that were soaking up carbon-dioxide to make way for long tracts of fairway. In other words, golf is a dirty sport thats wrecking the planet. But it doesnt have to be. The impact of golf on the climate and environment has led to growing calls to make the sport more sustainable  even to play on bone-dry courses, as golfing legend Tiger Woods has enjoyed. And its not just to save the planet, but to save the sport itself, as the climate crisis threatens to transform many courses into muddy swamps. The president of the American Society of Golf Course Architects (ASGCA), Jason Straka, told CNN Sport how the climate crisis has been affecting golf in flood-threatened Florida, and in Ohio and Utah, which have been hit by warmer-than-usual weather and even drought. Clubs never used to have to close after two-inch rain, now they do. They also experience sunny day flooding, said Straka. In Miami, authorities are raising public drains to a minimum of 3.4 feet, but more than 50% of courses in the city are under this minimum, which rings alarm bells for Straka. If they dont go out and literally lift their footprint up in the air, theyre going to be in a perpetually deeper and deeper bathtub, he said. If they think they have problems now, in 10 years, theyre going to be a swamp. But change will equate to cost, which is where golfs critics find their voice once more: courses are just not sustainable anymore. While courses in the eastern US are being threatened by changing rainfall patterns, deadly wildfires that ripped through the west, including in California, have led to poor air quality and course closures in recent years. Less stark, but by no means less worrying, are rising temperatures in Ohio, which are being infested with Bermuda grass, a warmer-season grass that can be difficult to control. READ: Lydia Ko: Sometimes results are so overrated, says former world No. 1 The situation in Australia is similar: Lynwood Country Club, northwest of Sydney, was flooded in 2020 and again earlier this year. At one stage, parts of the course were over 26 feet under water, while up the New South Wales coastline, Nambucca Heads received 42.5 inches of rainfall in just eight days. On the same eastern coast, some 350 miles south of Sydney in the state of Victoria, Mallacoota Golf Club very nearly perished during the bushfires of 2019 and 2020, the fairways providing a sanctuary for townsfolk. Club Catalina, further up the NSW coast, broke the firewall that threatened to wipe out the town. But in a country accustomed to regular wildfires, courses are adapting by trying to capture water when rain is heavy for use in course irrigation, or even to put out fires. Golf courses in Australia, by and large, all have some sort of irrigation storage which are very useful for fighting fires, Society of Australian Golf Course Architects (SAGCA) President Harley Kruse told CNN Sport, echoing Strakas comments on future forecasts. Last year in Sydney, there was a 1-in-100-years flood event. Were going to get an increase of various storm events which could be wind, rain, cyclone or we get a greater increase in drought events. Golf courses need to be flexible and more understanding. Fellow Australian Tim Lobb, President of the European Institute of Golf Course Architects (EIGCA), is promoting naturalization and grass reduction in Turkey to decrease water usage  15-20% of the area that was fine turf will use a lower-maintenance grass species. In cooler regions, coastal courses around the British Isles face a very uncertain future  none more so than the worlds fifth-oldest layout in Montrose, a few miles up the coast from major championship venue Carnoustie, where in the last 30 years, the sea has encroached by almost 230 feet (70 meters) in places, according to research released in 2016. With sea levels projected to rise by one meter in the next 50 years, the home of golf at St. Andrews in Scotland could be a swamp like Miami as early as 2050. Over in Iceland, Edwin Roald, renowned Icelandic architect and founder of Eureka Golf  a company committed to mitigating climate change through golf  told CNN how greater frequency of water freezing and thawing cycles in colder Northern Hemisphere climates is becoming a real danger to courses. We have a lot of issues with frozen water [...] and a lot of flash flooding, repeatedly throughout the winter. Its allowing that to happen without the water eroding the land. Winter kill, through the turfs suffocation under ice cover, is a greater threat and increasing. This causes financial damage to courses that are opening in spring with dead turf. READ: Celebrity golf coach Federico Alba reveals hidden life of Sicily At the COP26 summit in the Scottish city of Glasgow, the North Berwick-based environmentalist GEO Foundation for Sustainable Golf showed a virtual audience how golf is learning to be a champion among sporting bodies for a greener planet. Woburn, the host course for the 2019 Womens British Open, constructed its own reservoir in 2013 to capture rainwater to irrigate its turf, and more recently drilled a borehole to tap water from underground. The company managing the course says the new infrastructure should make Woburn fully self-sufficient, so it isnt using water that could be otherwise used for drinking and in homes. While at Remuera Golf Club in Auckland, carbon-dioxide (CO2) emissions were reduced by nearly 25 tons from 2018-19, through the cutting of all electricity use at the club. Finlands Hirsala Golf aims to have 40 robotic mowers running on electricity that can be sourced from renewable sources by 2022, cutting the usage of 1,000 liters of diesel fuel, while solar panels at Golf de Payerne in Switzerland have saved 1,080 tons of CO2. Back in Iceland, the country is measuring the carbon status of all of its 65 golf courses through the Carbon Par project  the first golfing nation to produce such an account. The method that is being used to produce this estimate, hopefully, others can use that going forward. To improve, you first have to know where you stand, said Roald. Golf courses are sequestering a considerable amount of carbon, which I think few people actually associate with golf. On the flipside, golf is a large land user and bound to be using wetlands in places. Emissions when you drain wetlands are so great. Forests, peatlands, deserts and tundra can all absorb and hold stocks of CO2. Of all the carbon held in land-based ecosystems, around 34% can be found in grasslands, data from the World Resources Institute shows. Thats not much less than the 39% held in forests. So whether a golf course might actually soak up a good amount of carbon-dioxide depends on how its managed and whether it destroys more valuable land to begin with. Roald added: Its only a matter of time before the golf industry will be asked questions about what we can do with those wetlands  thats where we can have the most impact. Climate change clamor has caught the eye of one of golfs most recognizable voices in Rory McIlroy, just one of many high-profile athletes who travel enormous distances by plane. I wouldnt self-profess to be an eco-warrior, but Im someone that doesnt want to damage the environment, the Florida-based Northern Irishman told the media at the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai. I live in a part of the world where hurricanes are very prevalent and becoming more and more prevalent as the years go on. I think we can all play our part in some way or another. We play on big pieces of land that take up a lot of water and a lot of other things that could maybe be put to better use. Ahead of a trip to the world-renowned Royal Melbourne in Australia, Kruse referenced comments in 2019 by Tiger Woods and Ernie Els at the Presidents Cup. Cutting to the chase, both players spoke highly of the courses natural setup  in essence, much like many past Open Championships, the course was dry and vast areas of the rough and even fairways had gone without water, letting Mother Nature dish up the elements to play the game, said Kruse. Well-watered and manicured golf courses can often provide softer conditions which produce better scoring and prettier TV images, but Els and Woods took the chance to laud another approach which will become the norm as courses seek sustainable practices. Els and Woods both talked up the advantages of playing on a dried-out course, like in Australia. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videos Kruse said he could barely believe his eyes when he saw a team of maintenance staff on TV earlier this year using petrol-driven leaf blowers to dry the rough, adding American courses probably have more sprinkler heads per golf course and water more area of turf compared to courses in, for example, Australia or the British Isles. Taking the drought in California a few years ago, I would hope that they havent gone back to their old ways and theyre having a rethink, Kruse said. You dont need 2,000 irrigation heads right from fence line to fence line to keep the course alive. You can let things dry out.",08/12/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/12/08/golf/climate-change-sustainability-spt-intl-cmd/index.html
Climate change likely played a role in this weekend? deadly tornadoes. The question is how.,"The series of weekend tornadoes that ripped through the parts of the US this weekend adds to another stretch of deadly and potentially unprecedented weather disasters that plagued the planet this year. Meteorologists and climate scientists say the latest outbreak is historic. And as these extreme weather events intensify, occur more often and exacerbate the countrys growing economic toll, science is running to keep up to answer emerging questions of whether climate change is intensifying every single disaster. With this weekends tornadoes, climate researchers say its too early to determine the link, but the uncertainty doesnt mean it is unlikely. In Kentucky, the series of tornadoes uprooted trees, tore down homes and infrastructure, and killed at least 74 people. Gov. Andy Beshear said at a news conference that the tornado event reached a level of devastation unlike anything I have ever seen, he said. Global scientists made clear that weather events, no matter how severe, are occurring against the backdrop of human-caused climate change; nevertheless, it all comes down to discerning how a warming planet is altering weather patterns, including geographical location and frequency, as well as severity. Scientists say the short-lived scale of tornadoes, coupled with an extremely inconsistent and unreliable historical record, makes connecting outbreaks to long-term, human-caused climate change extremely challenging. Unlike large-scale and slow-trending weather events such as droughts, floods and hurricanes, scientific research about the link between climate change and tornadoes has not been as robust. Victor Gensini, a professor at Northern Illinois University and one of the top tornado experts, said the weekends outbreak is one of the most remarkable tornado events in US history  and while climate change may have played a part in its violent behavior, its not yet clear what that role was. Think of a pair of dice, he said. On one of the die, you altered the value of five to six, which means it now has two sixes  raising the chances of you rolling the pair of dice and getting the value 12. Although you cant immediately attribute that value of 12 to the change you made, you just altered the probability of that event occurring. Gensini said thats similar to how the climate system now works  the more humans pump greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and change the system, the chances of extreme weather events occurring will amplify. He points to different ingredients that primed the landscape for the outbreak to happen, such as a late spring, early summer air mass and a strong wind shear. When you start putting a lot of these events together, and you start looking at them in the aggregate sense, the statistics are pretty clear that not only has there sort of been a change  a shift, if you will  of where the greatest tornado frequency is happening, Gensini told CNN. But these events are becoming perhaps stronger, more frequent and also more variable. Research by Gensini found that over the past four decades, tornado frequency has increased in vast swaths of the Midwest and Southeast, while decreasing in parts of the central and southern Great Plains, a region traditionally known as Tornado Alley. Some studies also indicate climate change could be contributing to an eastward shift in tornado alley, for instance, resulting in more tornadoes occurring in the more heavily populated states east of the Mississippi River, such as this tornado outbreak. Its also very common when you have La Nina in place to see this eastward shift in highest tornado frequency, Gensini said. But if you look at the past 40 years, the research Ive done ... has shown that places like Nashville, Tennessee, for example  or Mayfield, Kentucky, that we saw got hit  their frequency of tornadoes, their risk of having a tornado has increased over the last 40 years. Tornadoes take shape under particularly specific atmospheric conditions, but are primarily fueled by warm, moist air from strong winds that shift direction with altitude. Scientists have warned that the rise in greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere is drastically changing the climate system, even causing the jet stream  fast-flowing air currents in the upper atmosphere that influence day-to-day weather that could trigger a tornado event  to behave oddly. Jennifer Marlon, a climate scientist at the Yale School of Environment, told CNN its too early to say what caused the outbreak  whether natural variability or climate change  but there are some really important signatures that suggest that this very well may be linked to climate change, and that scientists are observing changes in the outbreaks, not just the severity of individual outbreaks and tornadoes, but also quiet periods. For example, if any of the tornadoes are rated EF-5 (estimated winds of 260 mph or greater), it would end a streak of 3,126 days since the last EF-5, which is the longest stretch without since records began in 1950. The last EF-5 tornado was the Moore, Oklahoma, tornado on May 20, 2013. Its likely that it was simply natural forces at play, against the background of climate change. The World Weather Attribution, a group of the worlds leading scientists that establishes the link between climate and weather, for instance, has recently unveiled findings that the warming climate neither intensified the flooding in Vietnam that killed 138 people this summer nor the Madagascar drought that led to the countrys food scarcity. Still, a recent report by the World Meteorological Organization found that an extreme weather event or climate disaster has occurred every day, on average, somewhere in the world over the last 50 years, marking a five-fold increase over that period and exacting an economic toll that has climbed seven-fold since the 1970s. As such climate disasters worsen and expand in scope, Marlon points to significant factors that increase disaster risks across society during these times including worsening weather disasters, increasing exposure due to growing populations, and more vulnerable infrastructure assets. Thats already taking shape in Mayfield, Kentucky, where officials say the citys main fire station and some of its police assets have become inoperable as a result of the devastating tornado system. Now, authorities are looking for alternative ways to address emergency calls. All these things are feeding into increase disaster risk, with many more consequences, including the fatalities, of course, but also enormous economic damages, she said. As the climate crisis accelerates, more people will be vulnerable to the most severe consequences of extreme weather events. Experts say cities shouldnt put off adaptation plans any longer, and instead treat them as a larger emergency response system. But Gensini said one thing is certain: regardless of climate change, these types of tornado disasters will continue to worsen as humans alter the landscape and build larger, more sprawling cities. We have more assets and more targets for the severe storms to hit, he said. So even if you take climate change out of the equation, which is very likely to make the problem worse, we still have this issue of human and societal vulnerability.",12/12/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/12/12/us/climate-change-tornado-disaster-risk/index.html
FEMA chief says powerful storms ?ew normal?in era of climate change,"Powerful storms like the ones that tore through parts of the central United States this weekend are the new normal in an era of climate change, the top federal emergency management official said on Sunday. Deanne Criswell, the FEMA administrator, said her agency was prepared to bolster resilience in the face of more severe weather. This is going to be our new normal, Criswell told CNNs Jake Tapper on State of the Union. The effects we are seeing of climate change are the crisis of our generation, Criswell said. Were taking a lot of efforts at FEMA to work with communities to help reduce the impacts that were seeing from these severe weather events and help to develop systemwide projects that can help protect communities. She said the severity, duration and magnitude of the storms this late in the year were unprecedented. A day earlier, President Joe Biden said it was too early to know the specific effect climate change had on this weeks storms. He said he would ask his Environmental Protection Agency to assess. Scientific research on the role that climate change is playing in the formation and intensity of tornadoes is not as robust as for other types of extreme weather like droughts, floods and even hurricanes. The short and small scale of tornadoes, along with an extremely spotty and unreliable historical record for them, makes assessing their relationships to long-term, human-caused climate change very difficult. While establishing connections between climate change and tornadoes is difficult, the correlation between El Nino/La Nina and tornadoes is strong. La Nina seasons tend to have increased tornado activity in the US, and it is worth noting that the US is currently experiencing La Nina, which is expected to last into spring of next year. Criswell was speaking ahead of a scheduled visit to Kentucky to assess damage from a string of powerful storms that swept across a wide swath of the Midwest and South. She will travel alongside Alejandro Mayorkas, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Criswell said the operation on the ground remains a rescue mission. I think there is still hope, right? We sent one of our federal urban search and rescue teams down to Kentucky. They arrived yesterday. Theyll be able to assist the localities with their ongoing rescue efforts. I think there is still hope and we should continue to try to find as many people as we can, she said. She listed housing  both short-term and long-term shelter  as a priority for the agency.",12/12/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/12/12/politics/deanne-criswell-fema-climate-change-cnntv/index.html
The Arctic fails its annual health check as global warming brings more ills to the region,"From extreme melt events to an influx of beaver colonies in Alaska, and rain falling at the summit of Greenland for the first time on record, the Arctic region showed clear symptoms of an ailing planet over the past year. A report published on Tuesday, which serves as an annual physical for the Arctic, found this vast and significant biome is changing profoundly. It continues to warm twice as fast as the rest of the Earth and is rapidly losing ice cover, transforming from a reliably-frozen landscape to a greener and browner one than it was just around a decade ago. More than 100 scientists authored the Arctic Report Card, published by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and examined changes in snow cover, sea ice volume, tundra vegetation, as well as surface air and ocean temperatures from October 2020 to September 2021. The report also describes an increase in commercial activities and ships that are venturing further into the Arctic on sea routes opened up by melting ice. They bring more garbage and noise to the region, changing its soundscape and interfering with the ability of marine mammals to communicate. Retreating glaciers and melting permafrost also threaten lives, economies and infrastructure. If you recognize that the Arctic really is the gateway to climate change, and that we need some means of taking a regular pulse check on how things are in that critical area, the report card represents, if you will, a bit of a snapshot, NOAA Administrator Richard Spinrad told CNN. Thats why its important, just like going to your doctor for an annual physical, he added. You want to get a consistent, comparable set of observations. This summer, the Greenland ice sheet experienced three extreme melt events in the period studied, according to the report. For people who live far from the Arctic and may think of the region as something in distance, Twila Moon, the lead editor of the report and scientist with the National Snow and Ice Data Center, explains that its all connected, especially when it comes to ice melt. As the Greenland ice sheet thaws, that loss of ice causes sea levels to rise, which can be strongly felt in places far from the Arctic, including low-lying Pacific Islands and coastal cities. These impacts can lead to coastal erosion, salt water intrusion in freshwater drinking resources, as well as disruptions to sewer and water systems. In addition, the Arctics thawing permafrost is also releasing more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, further exacerbating the warming of the entire planet. The Arctic report card this year is showing us how well connected we as people are to the environmental changes happening in the globe, and how these cascading disruptions in one place is not isolated and might influence other parts of the system, Moon told CNN. We now live at a time that is fundamentally different from the past and will be experiencing ongoing change into the future. A recent scientific report on the region showed that the Arctic Ocean had been warming since the onset of the 20th century, decades earlier than previously thought. While the year studied was the seventh warmest on record in the Arctic, the period from October to December 2020 was the warmest on record. The Arctic continues to warm more than twice as fast as the rest of the globe. The summer also brought warmer-than-usual temperatures. An August heatwave triggered rain to fall at the summit of Greenland instead of snow for the first time on record. As temperatures at the summit rose above freezing for the third time in less than a decade, the warm air fueled an extreme rain event that dumped 7 billion tons of water on the ice sheet. A report published after that event found this was likely to happen more often. The Arctic is expected to experience more rain than snow some time between 2060 and 2070, marking a major transition in its precipitation patterns as the climate crisis jacks up temperatures in the region. Things that happen in the Arctic dont specifically stay in the Arctic, Michelle McCrystall, climate researcher at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, who is not involved with the report, previously told CNN. The fact that there could be an increase in emissions from permafrost thaw or an increase in global sea level rise, it is a global problem, and it needs a global answer. The NOAA report card also found, from satellite images and other data, that North American beavers are taking over the Arctic tundra of Alaska, doubling their ponds in the last two decades. Scientists are also mapping beaver ponds in Canada and Asia. Thats an issue because beavers gnaw through and fell trees, and build dams, which can flood valleys and form new lakes that contribute to the thawing of the frozen permafrost soil. When permafrost melts, it emits large amounts of methane, a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Both the dwindling sea ice and shifting marine habitats are also bringing an uptick in shipping traffic to the Arctic. The rise in human activity, coupled with the environmental changes it brings, is drastically altering the marine soundscape, according to the report. In your home, if you notice that one of your lights is flickering, youd wonder if you got a problem with the electricity, Spinrad told CNN. But if you notice all the lights are flickering, the air conditioning is not working, and there are some leaks in the plumbing, youd start saying we have a serious problem overall with the home, not just an isolated set of incidents. Spinrad said its the aggregation of a wetter, less icy, greener and warmer Arctic that suggests the region is fundamentally different from the one the planet has known centuries, or even decades ago. The report found that, as the planet rapidly warms, retreating glaciers and thawing permafrost are already threatening the lives of the roughly five million people living in the permafrost region of the Northern Hemisphere, creating a cascading effect through economies, infrastructure, and national security of local Arctic communities. Glacial retreat is also exposing already arduous slopes that are prone to destabilize, which in the presence of deep water, can cause landslide-fueled tsunamis, flooding and debris flow that could potentially be deadly, the report shows. This last year adds to another stretch of exceptionally high tundra greenness since the report began; however, recent extreme events and other local influences such melting permafrost thaw or wildfires are also priming the landscape to become browner. Moon said that as the whole world is experiencing some level of impact from the climate crisis, people should be able to empathize with communities in the Arctic and not view the region as a disconnected place. The people of the Arctic are similarly experiencing extreme events and conditions that theyve never before witnessed or have to deal with, said Moon. So on a very human scale, we are all finding ourselves in a world that is now fundamentally changed from the the environmental conditions of the last many decades and centuries.",14/12/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/12/14/world/noaa-climate-change-arctic-report/index.html
From floods and wildfires to inaction and urgency: These are the top climate and weather stories of 2021,"The climate crisis took a catastrophic toll across the globe in 2021. From the Arctic to Louisiana and to Chinas Henan province, signs that climate change is already altering our weather were everywhere. In the United States, historic flooding trapped and killed residents in submerged basements. In Canada, an entire town was erased by a wildfire fueled by extreme heat. Rain fell at the summit of Greenland for the first time. As climate disasters mounted, the world aligned around combating the crisis: Scientists published a landmark report that concluded humans are unequivocally to blame; US President Joe Biden reentered the Paris Agreement in the early days of his administration; world leaders met at the UN climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, to negotiate solutions. But promises were not met with action in 2021, and humans are pumping more planet-warming emissions into the atmosphere than ever. Experts now warn that the Earth is currently on track for 2.4 degrees Celsius of warming above pre-industrial levels  far beyond the critical 1.5-degree threshold that scientists say we should stay under. This years disasters are proof the climate crisis is intensifying and that the window is rapidly closing to slash our reliance on fossil fuels and to prevent changes that would transform life as we know it. What we think of as climate change is now becoming very personal, Jennifer Marlon, a climate scientist at the Yale School of the Environment, previously told CNN. Its not far away anymore. Its now in our front yard, its in our backyards, its in our basements, its even in our lungs as (we are) breathing smoke from these wildfires. These are the top 10 climate crisis stories of 2021. In August, precipitation at the typically snowy summit of Greenland fell as rain for the first time. Temperatures at the Greenland summit  roughly two miles above sea level  rose above freezing for the third time in less than a decade around August 15. Precipitation fell as rain and dumped 7 billion tons of water on the ice sheet, enough to fill the Reflecting Pool at the National Mall in Washington, DC, nearly 250,000 times. It was the heaviest rainfall on the ice sheet since record keeping began in 1950, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. And scientists say it will occur more often: A recent study found the Arctic region is expected to experience more rain than snow sometime between 2060 and 2070, marking a major transition in its precipitation patterns as the planet warms. Things that happen in the Arctic dont specifically stay in the Arctic, Michelle McCrystall, climate researcher at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, previously told CNN. The fact that there could be an increase in emissions from permafrost thaw or an increase in global sea level rise, it is a global problem, and it needs a global answer. February brought a historic deep freeze to Texas, which was also felt across much of the Central Plains and into the Southeast, and showed how the climate crisis can produce both hot and cold extremes. A crippling winter storm swept across the Central United States the week of February 15, and plunged deep into Texas  a state ill-equipped to handle a multi-day freeze. Electricity generation ground to a halt, and around 4 million people lost power. At the time, Gov. Greg Abbott blamed the power outages on frozen wind turbines and solar panels, though the states fossil fuel energy sector was ultimately to blame for the energy crisis. The Texas Department of State Health Services reported the extreme winter weather killed more than 200 people. However, an independent analysis by Buzzfeed put the number of deaths between 500 and 1,000. The economic toll also proved catastrophic. The Texas comptrollers office reported the storm may have cost the state as much as $130 billion, and urged the weatherization of its power infrastructure. In the span of a few weeks, destructive and fatal flash flooding ravaged parts of Western Europe, Chinas Henan province and the state of Tennessee. In mid-July, severe flooding killed more than 200 people in Germany and Belgium. Vast swaths of the region saw 24-hour rainfall totals of roughly between 4 to 6 inches, which is more than an average months worth of rainfall in the area. World Weather Attribution, a group of scientists that establishes the link between climate change and weather, found the record rainfall was up to nine times more likely due to human-caused climate change. In China, the floods that struck Henan province killed more than 300 people. Zhengzhou, the provincial capital of 12 million people, was one of the hardest-hit areas. Entire neighborhoods were submerged, while passengers were trapped in inundated subway cars, clinging to ceiling handles to stay above water. Back in the United States, a staggering amount of rain led to flash flooding in Tennessee that destroyed more than 270 homes and killed more than two dozen people, including 7-month-old twins. State emergency management officials were not prepared for the magnitude of the event. The fallen phone lines, coupled with washed out roads, made it harder for them to get into the flood zone. Within hours of being sworn in, Biden signed an executive order in January to rejoin the global climate pact known as the Paris Agreement, which former President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of while in office. In April, Biden pledged to cut US greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030, in part to make good on the countrys renewed membership in the agreement. Under the Paris Agreement, countries are expected to track and enhance their commitments to drastically cut greenhouse gas emissions every five years. The primary goal of the climate accords is to put a lid on global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, with a preferred 1.5-degree limit. However, the United Nations says there is still a huge gap between whats been promised and what scientists say is needed to curb emissions. Every six to seven years, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change publishes a report that summarizes the state of climate research. The panels latest report came in August, and its authors concluded it is unequivocal that humans have caused the climate crisis and that widespread and rapid changes have already occurred, some of them irreversibly. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the report a code red for humanity. Scientists said the planet has rapidly warmed by more than 1 degree Celsius higher than pre-industrial levels, and is now barrelling toward 1.5 degrees  a critical threshold that world leaders agreed warming should remain below to avoid worsening impacts. To halt the precipitous trend, scientists say countries must make deep cuts to greenhouse gas emissions while simultaneously removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. World leaders gathered in Glasgow in November for the UN-brokered climate change summit known as COP26. And after nearly two weeks of negotiations on how to limit global warming, nearly 200 countries signed the Glasgow Climate Pact, which included the first-ever acknowledgment of the role burning fossil fuels have played in perpetuating the climate crisis. While the final pact showed some progress, the text didnt reflect the urgency scientists have called for. Countries agreed to phase down the use of unabated coal for power generation, instead of completely phasing it out. Developing nations also left disappointed after negotiations around climate financing  funding from wealthy nations to help low-income countries deal with the crisis  broke down. In late August, Category 4 Hurricane Ida destroyed homes, uprooted trees and cut off power to more than 1 million customers in Mississippi and the already storm-ravaged state of Louisiana. Ida checked all the boxes of how climate change is making hurricanes more dangerous, according to scientists: They are producing more rainfall, moving more slowly once they make landfall and generating larger storm surges. But the impact didnt end on the Gulf Coast. As the storm made its way inland, Idas remnants triggered flash flood emergencies in the Northeast. The storm broke the single-hour rainfall record in Central Park and gave Newark, New Jersey, its wettest day ever. The flooding killed dozens of people in the Northeast, and many of them drowned in basement apartments in New York City. Some Ida survivors in the city are still displaced, and the storm exposed the dire need to strengthen the citys infrastructure against the worsening climate crisis. Hurricane Idas damage cost at least $60 billion, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimated, and exceeded the combined cost of the seven most damaging tropical cyclones of 2020. At the tail end of a year already packed with extreme weather, a series of tornadoes tore through the Midwestern and Southeastern United States on December 12 and 13. The last month of the year is typically the quietest for tornadoes, but warm temperatures brought a historic twist. In Kentucky, tornadoes uprooted trees, leveled homes and killed dozens of people. Gov. Andy Beshear said at a news conference that the tornado event reached a level of devastation unlike anything I have ever seen. Though its not completely clear what role climate change played in Decembers outbreak, scientists say the fingerprints of global warming can be found on every extreme weather event. Victor Gensini, a professor at Northern Illinois University and a top tornado expert, said the outbreak is one of the most remarkable tornado events in US history. When you start putting a lot of these events together, and you start looking at them in the aggregate sense, the statistics are pretty clear that not only has there sort of been a change  a shift, if you will  of where the greatest tornado frequency is happening, Gensini told CNN, but these events are becoming perhaps stronger, more frequent and also more variable. An unprecedented heat wave in late June killed hundreds of people in the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia. All-time record temperatures were set across the region, and scientists say the heat wave would have been virtually impossible without human-caused climate change. Experts told CNN the normally temperate region is unprepared for extreme heat events, with many residents not owning air conditioning units. As a result, hundreds of people died from heat-related illness. Officials later called the heat wave a mass casualty event. In British Columbia, the same heat wave fueled a fast-moving wildfire that obliterated the town of Lytton just one day after the temperature soared to 121 degrees and broke Canadas all-time temperature record. Amid the acute disasters, the Western United States has been in the grips of a historic, multi-year drought, which scientists say is a clear sign of how the climate crisis is affecting not only the weather but water supply, food production and electricity generation. In California, this summers drought was the most extreme in the states 126-year record, with July 2021 as the driest month since data gathering began in 1895. By August, more than 95% of the West was in drought conditions. Lake Mead and Lake Powell  two of the countrys largest reservoirs  drained at alarming rates after a dry winter and extreme drought this summer. The federal government in August declared a water shortage on the Colorado River for the first time, triggering mandatory water consumption cuts for states in the Southwest beginning in 2022. The megadrought also primed the landscape for perilous wildfires. The three largest fires of 2021  the Bootleg, Dixie and Caldor Fires  have burned roughly 1.6 million acres, an area half the size of Connecticut. High-level winds wafted smoke from some of these fires across the country, stretching from the West Coast to New York City. Scientists say this summer is only a preview of whats to come: The United Nations August report concluded droughts that may have occurred only once every decade or so now happen 70% more frequently.",22/12/2021,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/12/22/us/top-climate-weather-stories-of-2021/index.html
Read these 5 things about the climate crisis,"CNN has a team of journalists covering the climate crisis full time, and they have published five separate stories in recent days that represent the past, present and future of the crisis. The past: The present: The future: More succinctly, these stories reflect that Earth has warmed nearly 1.5 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels, a threshold scientists have suggested is when the worst impacts of climate change will begin to occur. They reflect that there are already disastrous effects from climate change. The world is not curbing emissions fast enough to change the trend. New analysis from the nonpartisan Rhodium Group shows the US is (still) headed in the wrong direction on greenhouse gas emissions, which were around 6% higher in 2021 than 2020. And the stories reflect the political reality in Washington that bolder action is hard to come by. Democrats could potentially go around Republicans to enact President Joe Bidens climate change agenda, but they might have to sacrifice the social spending on things like universal pre-K. Bidens plan is to use tax dollars to incentivize companies to reduce emissions, since its clear they arent going to make the necessary cuts without government help. The Democrats have earmarked $555 billion for the effort. The US spent $750 billion in five years on climate disasters. One CNN graphic by CNNs John Keefe and Priya Krishnakumar maps the costliest climate disasters in the US over the past year  20 cost $1 billion or more. The disasters occurred across the country and range from Hurricane Ida, which cost $75 billion in 2021, to winter weather, wildfires and flooding. 2021 was, in essence, watching the climate projections of the past come true, Rachel Licker, a senior climate scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, told CNNs Rachel Ramirez. Not all weather related to climate change will be warm. CNN meteorologist Jennifer Gray writes about the cold in the Northeast this week: Its the kind of cold capable of delivering frostbite in minutes, turn boiling water into frozen mist in a nanosecond, and even cold enough to freeze your eyelashes. But itll feel even colder than that. With wind chill, it will feel like minus 60 degrees Fahrenheit on summit peaks in Vermont. Cold in a time of warming. I enjoyed this passage from Grays report on the difference between todays cold and the warming climate: As meteorologists, we always hear Oh, so wheres your global warming now? Honestly, its becoming less common the more people become educated on climate change, but theres always someone who will troll us on social media and bring it up. So before the tweets begin, heres your answer. Even in a warming climate, there will still be some cold extremes, or periods of intense and even record-breaking cold at times, explained CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller. Look no further than last year, when a massive cold-air outbreak in the central and southern portions of the US caused power outages for millions and resulted in the costliest winter storm in US history. While the cold spell will be significant, it will be fairly short-lived and confined to one or two regions of the country. Compare that to last month, which saw several weeks worth of record-shattering warmth over more than half of the country, which helped to spawn deadly severe weather which was unprecedented in December, said Miller. He also adds, But cold extremes are becoming far fewer, especially compared to hot extremes, which are outpacing them by two or three to one over the recent decade. Two futures. Experts told CNNs Ramirez that bold action to cut emissions could actually lead the Earth to cool in the second half of this century. But she writes the course right now, according to the watchdog Climate Action Tracker, is for the world to blow past 1.5 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels, up to 2.4 degrees of warming or more. Surely, if climate disasters get worse and more frequent, countries will snap to attention. Right? People dont always act. Think back to the warnings early in the Covid-19 pandemic that hundreds of thousands of Americans could die. That seemed nuts at the time. But here we are, 838,000 and counting Covid-19 deaths later, sustaining more than 1,000 daily deaths per day and hurtling toward 1 million total US deaths from the disease. People can be given access to vaccines and shown the proof that they lead to much less severe Covid-19. Millions still wont get the shots. If climate change is anything like Covid-19, all the warnings scientists can shout wont change every mind. Companies and governments can talk about their efforts to cut emissions, but its clear the most drastic actions will take government requirements. Thats assuming Democrats can find a way to pass their bill  which has already been pared down dramatically to remove penalties for emitting companies and to satisfy Sen.

The next front in fighting climate change: your home,"The Build Back Better bill, if it ever comes to pass, now seems unlikely to include any major climate change provisions. But we can still reduce our own carbon emissions, starting with our own homes. About 20% of greenhouse gases in the US come from homes. And the homes of the wealthiest Americans, who can most easily afford climate-saving modernizations, emit about 25% more greenhouse gases per capita than those of lower-income residents. These are problems we can solve, as homeowners, with new technology, and through government incentives. When we think about our homes carbon footprint, most of us think of solar panels, but switching to electricity from fossil fuels for heating our homes air and water may be even more important. More than half of the energy homes use is for heating and air conditioning, and nearly two-thirds of US homes rely on fossil fuels for heat. Switching from natural gas to electricity for heating a home has a dramatic impact on its carbon output. In a place like Sacramento, for instance, that switch would reduce its emissions by 45% today. And the benefits would only increase over time. Unlike the furnace burning gas in your basement, the power plants generating electricity for a heat pump will get more efficient, getting more power from the sun and other sources of renewable energy. So that Sacramento home would, if electrified, emit 82% less greenhouse gases by 2050. The home would also have lower utility bills. The reason most people havent already made this transition is because we dont even think of our homes as being heated by fossil fuels. The energy industry has promoted natural gas as a cleaner-burning fuel for heating your air and water and for powering your stove, oven and dryer. Its true that burning natural gas produces about half the amount of carbon dioxide that coal does, for the same amount of energy. But producing and transporting natural gas to your home emits methane, which can be 86 times more potent at warming the planet than carbon dioxide. This is only one reason why, in the US, natural gas contributes just as much to climate change as coal. Changing how we heat every home in America is a massive undertaking, but the good news is weve done it before. Coal or wood heated about 77% of US homes in 1940 and about 16% by 1960. This cycle is beginning anew now: More than 50 cities in California, and most recently New York City, have stopped or plan to stop granting permits for buildings that use natural gas or other fossil fuels rather than electricity. But other states are moving in the opposite direction. By 2021, 20 US states had quietly prepared preemption laws, exempting natural gas utilities from city regulations. That means that, absent an expensive retrofit, many buildings will likely be powered by gas for decades. Such preemption laws are just one example of why we need federal action, but progress there has been mixed. The Build Back Better plan, which would have provided billions of dollars in subsidies largely for home electrification and retrofits, is unlikely to continue in its current form. The evidence that its incentives wouldve worked is overwhelming. The use of heat pumps has boomed where governments have offset part of the costs. But government incentives arent the only way to reduce our homes impact on the climate. As the technology improves for heat pumps, induction ranges and other appliances to make the home more efficient, people will adopt these technologies just to save money, and to be more comfortable. Solar panels are the obvious example of how technology can change the economics of mass adoption. From 2009 to 2019, the cost of generating solar power declined 89%, from $359 per megawatt-hour to $40. After accounting for plant-building and operating costs, solar panels were once three times more expensive than fossil fuels, but now are less than half the cost of fossil fuels. This sea-change in efficiency is why the majority of people who install solar panels now save money from day one. There is usually no down-payment required for a solar panel loan, and the typical utility bill savings can exceed the monthly loan payment even in the first year. It should thus come as no surprise that it took the US 40 years to get a million solar panel installations, and only three years to get the next million. The way we build and furnish homes is changing, too. Homes are being built in factories by companies like Plant Prefab and Veev, lowering the environmental impact of their construction and operation while improving building time, cost and the quality of construction. Other companies, like Advanced Earthen Construction Technologies, are now manufacturing homes out of earthen blocks, avoiding the use of lumber and concrete, both of which contribute to global warming. Earthen-block homes are naturally insulated against extreme temperatures, and are resistant to the wildfires that are becoming more common in the West. As home construction, power generation, and heating and cooling technologies change, we just have to make sure our thinking changes, too. Home ownership now comes with new responsibilities, and new opportunities to leave the world better than we found it. This involves learning about a new kind of economics, not only to own a home, but to run it. Our goal can be not just to benefit our own family, but all of us.",10/01/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/01/10/perspectives/redfin-ceo-home-climate/index.html
Climate change is coming for our coffee,"Bad news for coffee lovers: Climate change will make it much harder to grow Arabica coffee in the coming years, according to a study published Wednesday in the scientific journal Plos One. The study examined how coffee-growing conditions will change by 2050 based on projections from several global climate models. Results show that coffee plants will be drastically less suitable for cultivation in current coffee-producing regions by 2050 because of the impacts of climate change. Arabica coffee, which is used by Starbucks and other major coffee sellers, is already a finicky crop that requires specific conditions to flourish. Currently the most suitable areas for coffee growth are in Central and South America, particularly Brazil, as well as Central and West Africa and parts of South and Southeast Asia, according to the study by Roman Gruter and others at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences in Switzerland. Over the next 28 years, projected climate change impacts to those areas will make them far less friendly to coffee crops, the report found. The main coffee producing countries investigated (Brazil, Vietnam, Indonesia, Colombia) are all seriously affected by climate change with a strong decline in suitable areas ... and an increase in unsuitable areas by 2050, according to the report, which noted that higher temperatures make it harder to grow coffee. The study also looked at how climate change will impact growing conditions for cashews and avocados. For those items, rising temperatures could actually create new viable growing environments in some areas, according to the report. Coffee, however, proved to be most vulnerable, with negative climate impacts dominating in all main producing regions, the study found. The authors concluded that for all three crops, climate change adaptation will be necessary in most major producing regions. That could include breeding varieties that are better suited to the new conditions. And in the case of coffee, it might also mean switching to Robusta trees, which are hardier but produce beans generally considered to be of lower quality than Arabica beans. In the worst case, it could also mean that farmers would have to shift to a different crop, Gruter told CNN Business, adding that its difficult to say at what point and where this will happen. Some companies are already preparing for the changing conditions. Starbucks (SBUX), for example, is distributing climate-resistant coffee varietals to farmers and working to protect at-risk forests in important coffee growing areas, among other initiatives. Coffee prices have already been spiking due to bad weather. Severe drought and unusual frost conditions in Brazil, the worlds largest supplier of coffee beans, have driven up coffee futures. Retail prices for US coffee prices grew 6.3% last year, below inflation overall. Major coffee companies including Starbucks buy coffee far in advance at set prices. But eventually, price hikes will hit consumers. Tighter supply will only exacerbate the situation. Coffee is just one category of food impacted by extreme weather. Droughts, storms and frost, previously rare or unheard of in some areas, are becoming the norm in farming regions around the world, making it difficult for farmers to plan ahead, wreaking havoc on food supplies and driving up prices.",26/01/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/01/26/business/coffee-climate-change/index.html
Here? another thing keeping prices high: Climate change,"The pandemic economy is one of imbalances: supply chain woes and rising inflation have been with us for a while now, with few solutions in sight. But theres another big shock to the global economy taking shape: climate change. Although the pandemic will eventually end  whether it takes months or years  climate change is here to stay. More severe weather events and shifting climate patterns will continue to create problems for people and businesses around the world. And the already battered global supply chains will be on the front lines. Thats bad news for the rampant pandemic-era inflation that Americans have had to get used to during Covid. Think unseasonably cold winters or hotter-than-normal summers increasing energy costs and prices for products like fans, AC units and generators. Meanwhile, fires, droughts, floods and storms can affect the food supply chain and drive prices up. And any extreme weather event can lead to property damages that then affect material and construction costs. Of course these factors are not the only drivers of higher prices. With energy, for example, geopolitical events still play an even bigger role. Nevertheless, the impact from climate change is real, too. Businesses and lawmakers are looking for ways to mitigate the fallout from a shifting climate in real time. Last years big freeze in Texas, more active hurricane seasons and record floods are a reality for many Americans. Climate change is no longer an abstract concept. But thinking about it from the perspective of economic risk rather than pure politics changes the tone: Climate is essentially an economic problem and its about how we manage the risk, Dr. Sanjay Patnaik, director of the Center on Regulation and Markets at The Brookings Institution, told CNN Business. And Patnaik isnt alone in his opinion. Companies, industry groups and government agencies are all starting to pay more attention. In September 2020, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission published a report calling climate change a major risk to the stability of the US financial system and to its ability to sustain the American economy. And last year, an IMF official said a climate crisis could ignite a financial crisis. The potential financial and economic impact  including on inflation  is good reason for central banks to look at climate change, Patnaik said. Last year, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell called for a coordinated response to climate change to mitigate the risks to the world economy. Managing inflation is one of the Feds two main mandates, along with keeping unemployment low. Soaring prices during the pandemic recently led the bank to change its policies. Elsewhere, central banks are already deeply involved in the climate risk challenge: Last year, the Bank of England was given a new mandate to support the UK governments goal to become a net zero economy by 2050. The pandemic has gotten Americans used to supply chain troubles. But with increasingly frequent extreme weather events, these disruptions might become more common  even once Covid is a thing of the past. The days where we can get anything we want at the price we want are over in the era of climate change, said Patnaik. Climate change will raise costs of transport and logistics. I think food, agriculture, is going to change fundamentally. In fact, thats already happening. Before the pandemic took over, we were already seeing supply chain issues because of climate events, said Geoffrey Heal, professor of social enterprise at Columbia Business School. In 2011, for example, devastating floods in Thailand disrupted the supply chains for consumer electronics and auto parts, with some US car makers even halting production. More recently  and while the pandemic was already raging  the worst flooding in decades around Wuhan, China weighed on the US supply chain for personal protective equipment. Thats also a reminder that globalized supply chains mean companies and consumers could be affected by extreme weather anywhere in the world. Climate change administers shocks to the supply chains. Theyre one-off shocks, but they may be coming more frequently than before, Heal said, adding that with the increasing frequency of severe droughts, the food supply chain could be affected. Weve seen a bit of that with the droughts in the Midwest, he said. We could certainly see droughts in the United States, or in India, or in Russia. If inflation is running low when major climate events occur, the impact on prices might prove short-lived, Heal added. But in an already inflationary environment, like the one America is in right now, extreme weather could keep prices high for much longer.",01/02/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/02/01/economy/climate-change-inflation-food-energy-prices/index.html
"UK plants are flowering a whole month earlier than they used to, study shows","Spring has sprung early in parts of the UK this year, and while British people are celebrating the unseasonal warm weather, theres actually cause for concern. Climate change is making plants across the British Isles flower, on average, a month earlier than they used to, a new study shows. And that might set off a chain of events that could disrupt ecosystems and potentially cause entire species to collapse. If global temperatures continue to rise at their current rate, spring could eventually start in February on a regular basis, according to the study, published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. The results are truly alarming, said Professor Ulf Buntgen, lead author of the study, from the University of Cambridges Department of Geography. When plants flower too early, it is expected to have detrimental consequences for wildlife, agriculture and gardeners. During winter, plants are able to protect themselves from frost because they put themselves in a dormant winter sleep mode, Buntgen told CNN. However, an early spring brings forward the vegetation period, the phase when plants begin to grow. If a frost occurs during this time, the plants will suffer, and some may die. Fruit trees are particularly at risk of a late frost, which could bring serious consequences for fruit farmers, who stand to lose entire crop yields. While the study speaks to a long-term trend, other parts of the world have reported recent early flowering seasons. Last March, Japan recorded its earliest cherry blossom bloom in 1,200 years. In 2019, a heat wave in the United States caused sunflowers to bloom earlier than usual, because they are susceptible to temperature changes. While people enjoyed the early blooms, the overenthusiastic flowers made it harder for farmers to plant other crops in those areas. Another cause for concern is something researchers call ecological mismatch. Plants, insects, birds and other wildlife have evolved over time to coordinate the way they develop. A change to this cycle can initiate a chain reaction, causing damage to ecosystems. A certain plant flowers and attracts a particular type of insect, which attracts a particular type of bird, and so on, Buntgen said. But if one component responds faster than the others, theres a risk that theyll be out of sync, which can cause species to collapse and lead to biodiversity loss if they cant adapt quickly enough. The study is based on the analysis of more than 400,000 observations of over 400 plant species dating back to the mid-18th century until 2019. The database relies on citizen reporting, or crowd sourcing. Researchers looked at the first flowering dates of trees, shrubs, herbs and climbers in locations from the Channel Islands to Shetland in Scotland and Northern Ireland, and classified their findings by location, elevation and whether they were from urban or rural areas. The first flowering dates were compared with monthly climate records, which showed that the average first flowering had advanced by an entire month and is strongly linked to rising global temperatures. This data is stored by the Woodland Trust in whats known as Natures Calendar, a database with 3.5 million entries that date back to the 1730s. Rather than breaking the data down to look at individual species, which can become too noisy and inconclusive, the study focused on a bigger sample size to ensure the data is robust, Buntgen said. To really understand what climate change is doing to our world, we need these much larger datasets that look at whole ecosystems over a long period of time. He added that Natures Calendar was a rich data source with high scientific value. Alongside temperature records, we can use it to quantify how climate change is affecting various ecosystems across the UK.",02/02/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/02/01/uk/uk-plants-flowering-early-climate-change-intl-scn/index.html
"Cruel irony of US politics: Climate change, Ukraine, gas prices","Heres an epic plot twist in the American political drama: A President and party that came to office promising to wean the country off oil and gasoline to save the planet are now looking for ways to bring down the price of oil and gas to save a presidency. How did we get here? Preparing people for sacrifice. Biden appealed to Americans moral compass and sense of duty Tuesday, when he sought to justify standing up to Russian President Vladimir Putin over Ukraine. (If) we do not stand for freedom, where it is at risk today, well surely pay a steeper price tomorrow, he said. But there may be a price paid today, too. I will not pretend this will be painless, he said. Quick update on the Russia-Ukraine crisis. The US believes there is no evidence that Russia is removing any of its troops from the border with Ukraine, despite Moscows claims that it is. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken explained things Wednesday on ABC: Unfortunately, theres a difference between what Russia says and what it does. And what were seeing is no meaningful pullback. He added: On the contrary, we continue to see forces, especially forces that would be in the vanguard of any renewed aggression against Ukraine, continuing to be at the border, to mass at the border. How would an invasion hurt Americans? CNNs Matt Egan has a listicle that counts six ways the Russia-Ukraine crisis could hurt your wallet. No. 1: More pain at the pump. He notes that Russia is the second-largest oil producer in the world, behind only the US. Supply is already failing to keep up with demand and investors are on high alert for any further supply shortfalls that could occur ... in a variety of ways, including damaged infrastructure in a war, sanctions on Russia or Moscow moving to weaponize exports, Egan wrote. JPMorgan has warned of $120 or even $150 per barrel crude oil if Russian exports are disrupted. The current price is less than $100 per barrel. Gas prices are setting records. CNNs Chris Isidore writes: Gas in California hit a record high of $4.72 a gallon on average on Wednesday  and experts say a whopping $5 a gallon will likely be the norm there in a matter of months, if not sooner. The Russia standoff could drive prices up further, but the hike in California also has a climate change element to it. Isidore notes there are changes on the West Coast in part due to a switch to renewable fuels. That change, necessary to transition away from fossil fuels, is pushing California prices faster than the countrys as a whole. The nationwide average gas price is $3.51 a gallon. California is the proxy for what will happen with the energy transition, Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for the Oil Price Information Service, tells Isidore. A number of refineries have closed permanently. ... Getting people away from fossil fuels might be the right thing to do, but it is not without pain. When I asked Isidore about gas prices in California, he pointed out that if Biden does want to meet his goal of half of auto sales in the US being electric vehicles, the White House should be thrilled by high gas prices. As gas prices were rising in California, 10% of its car sales were EVs through the first 11 months of 2021  three times the national average, Isidore said. Changing their agenda? Democrats  who are already nervous about midterm elections in which Republicans are favored to push them out of the majority in Congress  are considering changes to their policy agenda, according to reports in The New York Times and The Washington Post. Having failed so far to pass their massive social spending and climate change bill, they could retool to focus on gas prices  including a new push for a federal gas tax holiday  and the skyrocketing deficit. What is the gas tax and where does it go? The gas tax holiday idea might sound interesting, but it would not do much to affect gas prices. The federal gas tax of 18.4 cents per gallon pays into a trust fund that finances US highways. The tax was first imposed in the 1930s and it has been set since 1993. It was not raised to pay for the bipartisan infrastructure bill to improve the nations roads and bridges, which Congress passed last year. Few options to control gas prices. When asked on Tuesday about the gas tax holiday, the White House said that all options were on the table but declined to outright endorse the idea. Press secretary Jen Psaki did not mention it when she was asked what steps Biden could take to combat price increases due to the Ukraine situation. She noted Biden has already tapped the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a move experts said is mostly symbolic. The other tool Biden has is pressure on other countries. He has also engaged, we have engaged with oil-producing countries around the world, Psaki said. Thats something we will continue to do because, clearly, we need to ensure that the supply out in the global market is meeting the demand. Pressure is not working. The Wall Street Journal notes that Saudi Arabia appeared to snub Bidens campaign to increase global output. The Saudis are part of OPEC+, a consortium of oil-producing countries that includes Russia and sets oil prices. RELATED: Biden officials dispatched to Saudi Arabia to discuss energy concerns amid Russia-Ukraine crisis Even if a gas tax holiday would bring prices down, it would require 60 votes in the Senate  and that seems unlikely. Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the Dr. No of the Democratic caucus, has already thrown cold water on the idea. People want their bridges and their roads, and we have an infrastructure bill we just passed this summer, and they want to take that all away, said Manchin, according to the Post. It just doesnt make sense. A gimmick. Republicans, despite their usual anti-tax tendencies, are even less supportive. I dont know that theres a unanimous feeling, but my response is that trying to eliminate the gas tax is basically a gimmick, Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho told reporters. That leaves Biden fearing further hikes, unable to control them and very likely to pay his own political price for the pain Americans feel at the pump. One thing higher gas prices might also do is turn Americans away from fossil fuels toward renewable energy and cleaner vehicles. Thats something everyone concerned about climate change can support, even if it hurts to get there.",16/02/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/02/16/politics/russia-ukraine-gas-price-inflation-what-matters/index.html
"?elay means death? We?e running out of ways to adapt to the climate crisis, new report shows. Here are the key takeaways","Climate change is on course to transform life on Earth as we know it, and unless global warming is dramatically slowed, billions of people and other species will reach points where they can no longer adapt to the new normal, according to a major report published Monday. The UN-backed report, based on years of research from hundreds of scientists, found that the impacts from human-caused climate change were larger than previously thought. The reports authors say these impacts are happening much faster and are more disruptive and widespread than scientists expected 20 years ago. The authors point to enormous inequities in the climate crisis, finding that those who contribute the least to the problem are the worst affected, and warn of irreversible impacts if the world exceeds 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the report an atlas of human suffering and a damning indictment of failed climate leadership, and he warned that delay means death. The facts are undeniable. This abdication of leadership is criminal, Guterres said in a statement. The worlds biggest polluters are guilty of arson of our only home. He also said that current events showed the world was too reliant of fossil fuels, calling them a dead end, in an apparent reference to the Ukraine conflict and energy crisis. Here are the reports key takeaways: Scientists have warned for decades warming needs to stay below 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. Mondays report, from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), showed if that limit is breached, some changes will be irreversible for hundreds  if not thousands  of years. And some changes may be permanent, even if the planet cools back down. The world is already 1.1 degrees Celsius warmer than before industrialization, according to the IPCCs estimate, which is considered conservative. We are now rapidly barreling toward 1.5 degrees. With every extreme event, ecosystems are being pushed more toward so-called tipping points beyond which irreversible changes can happen, according to the report. At warming of 2 degrees, for example, as many as 18% of all land species will be at high risk of extinction, according to the report. At 4 degrees, 50% of species are threatened. There are many challenges already with 1.5 degrees for several systems that we know about, said Hans-Otto Portner, a co-chair on the report and a scientist at the Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research. Clearly for coral reefs, we must say that in many locations, they are already beyond tipping points. They are on the downslide. Highly vulnerable ecosystems in the Arctic, mountains and on the coasts are at the greatest risk to these changes, the authors say. Ice sheet and glacier melt will cause accelerated sea level rise, irreversible for centuries. Forests, peatlands and permafrost  places where greenhouse gas is naturally stored  risk being pushed into a situation where they are emitting those gases into the atmosphere, causing even more warming. Adaptation is finding ways to live with the change  like putting up walls to ward off sea level rise or implementing new building codes to ensure homes can withstand more extreme weather. Scientists note some of our adaptations have blunted the impact of the climate crisis so far, but they are not adequate in the long-term. Our options to adapt will become even more limited at 1.5 degrees. And although the natural world has adapted to changing climates over millions of years, the pace of human-caused global warming is pushing many of the planets most critical systems  like rainforests, coral reefs and the Arctic  to the brink. More extreme weather doesnt just affect humans, it is causing mass die-offs in plants and animals. Population growth and development, which has not been carried out with long-term adaptation in mind, are also luring people into harms way. As many as 3.6 billion people live in places already highly vulnerable to climate hazards, some of which will increase beyond the ability to adapt once the planet hits the 1.5-degree mark. A lot of the worlds resources, particularly international finance, goes toward reducing greenhouse emissions, which is known as mitigation. At the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow, Scotland, last year, developing nations complained that the rich world was failing to help adequately fund adaptation in their countries. We have seen that the vast majority of climate finance goes towards mitigation rather than adaptation, said Adelle Thomas, an author on the report and a climate scientist at the University of the Bahamas. So although adaptation is taking place, there is not enough funding, and it is not a high priority, which are then leading to these limits. Around half of the worlds population experiences severe water scarcity each year in part due to climate-related factors, the report showed. Water will become even more scarce at higher global temperatures. At 2 degrees of warming  which scientists predict the planet will reach by midcentury  as many as three billion people around the world will experience chronic water scarcity, according to the report. It increases to four billion people at 4 degrees. Water shortages will put enormous pressure on food production and increase the worlds already dire food-security challenges. A water crisis is already brewing in the Western United States. Multiyear drought has drained reservoirs and triggered unprecedented water cuts for the region. Lake Mead, the countrys largest reservoir, plunged to record lows in recent months, threatening water supply for tens of millions of people. Most of the Middle East is experiencing high levels of water stress, expected to worsen the more the Earth warms, raising questions over how long those parts of the region will remain inhabitable. Vast swaths of Africa have also struggled in recent years with prolonged drought. The report focuses on the interconnectedness between the Earths ecosystems and humans, including how the climate crisis is altering water resources. What we really wanted to show is that ecosystems and all sectors of human society and human well-being fundamentally depends on water, Tabea Lissner, a scientist at Climate Analytics and an author on the report, told CNN. And its not just the water resource itself that plays an important role in water security, but also what form and in what quality we can access it, and really showing how many different ways climate change really affects humans and ecosystems through various channels. The countries that emit the least planet-warming gases, mainly those in the Global South and island territories, tend to be the ones disproportionately harmed by climate hazards, the report showed. We live in an unequal world, Eric Chu, an author of the report and scientist at University of California, Davis, told CNN. The losses are inequitably distributed among communities, especially those communities that have historically been disadvantaged from decision-making, and now were seeing some of that inequality manifest as well in the choices we make to adapt. Camille Parmesan, an ecologist at CNRS Ecology Station and an author of the report, said as climate change worsens, more Indigenous people will lose the land, water and biodiversity they depend on. Theres increasing evidence that many Indigenous communities that do rely a lot more on the natural systems for their food and their livelihoods are not only the most exposed, because those natural systems are being very heavily impacted, but theyre the most vulnerable because often theyre there in areas with high poverty or poor access to health care, Parmesan said. As the climate crisis advances, more people will be forced to relocate, adding stress and vulnerability to other regions. When the Earth doesnt become farmable, the dependence in the livelihood that communities have on farming and on production of food, not only will the incomes be lost, but that food security will be lost, said Vivek Shandas, a professor of climate adaptation and urban policy at Portland State University, who was not involved with the report. That ability to survive every day is lost. As humans, throughout history, we moved from places that are less habitable to places that are more attainable and habitable. While many regions in the developing world are unable to adapt because of a lack of finance and capacity, the IPCC singles out North America as a region where misinformation and politicization are a barrier. Thats led to a misunderstanding of how great the risk is, and has polarized the response to the crisis, ultimately delaying urgent adaptation planning and implementation, the reports authors say. In Europe, they note a lack of political leadership and a low sense of urgency are among the hurdles to overcome. But these are barriers that can be overcome, and the authors say there is still a window of opportunity to implement meaningful action  though its closing, fast. There are opportunities to adapt between now and 1.5 [degrees], in addition to making deep cuts to heat-trapping fossil fuel emissions, Chu said. But as we go beyond 1.5, the opportunity space becomes much more constrained and reduces the effectiveness. Lissner said the report is an urgent call for action for world leaders to move toward climate-resilient development: reducing emissions as low as possible while also investing in adaptation to cope with the changes we already see. Decision makers also need to be intentional in helping the most disadvantaged communities and countries, so no one gets left behind in the process. Its important for this to also be done in an inclusive or equitable manner, Lissner said, looking into how the most vulnerable regions can really be supported in adaptation.",28/02/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/02/28/world/un-ipcc-climate-report-adaptation-impacts/index.html
UN report on climate crisis confirms the world already has solutions ?but politics are getting in the way,"The world is careening toward levels of global warming that will have irreversible impacts, a new landmark report says, but we already have the solutions  the only thing preventing us from taking advantage of them is political will and status-quo interests in fossil fuels. The third and final installment of the sixth UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, published Monday, shows how renewable energy sources like wind and solar are now economically viable and becoming cheaper by the day. But while the focus on solutions give the report an optimistic tone, it also serves as a reminder of how policies lag far behind science, technology and even economics. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres called the report a litany of broken promises and a file of shame, cataloguing the empty pledges that put us firmly on track towards an unlivable world. The jury has reached a verdict. And it is damning, Guterres said. We are on a fast track to climate disaster. If the world doesnt strengthen its policies toward renewable energy, global warming could blow through the 1.5 degree-Celsius threshold that scientists have warned of and surpass 3 degrees by the end of the century, the reports scientists said. The planet is already around 1.1 degrees warmer than pre-industrial levels. The report was published as much of the world grapples with an energy crunch that has sent energy prices soaring. Russias war in Ukraine has also moved several countries, especially in Europe, to not only wean off Russian fossil fuel exports but to replace them in part with more renewable energy. Here are the key takeaways. The cost of wind and solar energy have dropped dramatically in the past decade and are now competitive with coal and gas for electricity, the report shows. In some contexts, these renewable sources of energy are even cheaper than fossil fuels. Many countries have ramped up the installation of wind turbines  both on and offshore  and solar panels, whether on buildings or in huge solar farms that can power entire communities. And the amount of electricity generated by renewables is growing rapidly. A recent report by climate think tank Ember showed the world generated a record-setting 10% of its energy from wind and solar 2021. The International Energy Agency said in a recent report that renewable energy capacity grow by more than 60% by 2026, from 2020 levels. While onshore wind and solar are now cost competitive with coal and natural gas for power, there are still huge upfront costs for installation which add to the inequities of the renewable energy transition, according to the report. For that reason, many developing countries  particularly in the Global South  lag behind in the adoption of solar and wind power. In deliberations over Mondays report, some developing countries were calling for rich nations to transfer more money to the Global South to help it pay for the transition, according to a source familiar with the talks. Those countries argued that wealthy nations were historically more responsible for climate change and should shoulder more of the financial burden. To limit warming to 1.5 degrees, or even 2 degrees, the worlds energy systems must rapidly decarbonize, the reports authors say. Ending fossil fuel subsidies could also reduce emissions by up to 10% by 2030. The report was published after marathon talks between global representatives went well into Sunday night, during which fossil fuel-producing nations opposed to a declarative call to end the use of coal, oil and gas in the near future, a source familiar with the talks told CNN, without naming particular nations. We cannot run our fossil fuel-based infrastructures anymore the way we did, said Jan Christoph Minx, a climate researcher and a lead author on the report, at a news conference. The big message coming from here is we need to end the age of fossil fuel. And we dont only need to end it, but we need to end it very quickly. By 2050, electricity should contribute very little to greenhouse gas emissions, the report concludes. If the world builds new fossil fuel infrastructure, its at serious risk of locking in the use of coal, oil and gas for decades to come, which will undermine efforts to contain global warming. But even continuing to operate existing fossil fuel infrastructure puts the world off track for staying under 1.5 degrees. Any newly built fossil fuel projects risk becoming stranded assets, or being abandoned, the report concludes, which carries massive financial risk. The estimated losses from stranded fossil fuel infrastructure is projected to be between $1 trillion and $4 trillion, from 2015 to 2050, in a scenario where the world limits global warming to 2 degrees. But the report does leave room for continued fossil fuel use that utilizes carbon capture and storage  or CCS  a process in which the emissions from coal, oil and gas are captured and stored. The reports authors say this is only viable if the vast majority of emissions are captured. CCS is highly controversial given it will allow the continued use of fossil fuels, even when more economical renewable sources are available. And studies have questioned how much greenhouse gas the CCS process can really capture. As we slash emissions, the reports scientists say we also need to start removing the carbon dioxide (CO2) thats already in the air. Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) can be achieved by planting trees and restoring forests and grasslands, but scientist say we must think beyond that. Some critical forests, because of human activity, are already transitioning from absorbing carbon dioxide to emitting it. Were already using planting trees and taking up soil carbon as as greenhouse gas removal technologies, but they are obviously limited in scope, said Jo House, a climate researcher and lead author on the report. Theres only so much land and you cant expect the land to mop up all the fossil fuel emissions. Some companies are developing machines that essentially act as giant vacuums, pulling carbon dioxide out of the air, but so far these technologies operate at a very small scale. Another way to achieve this is ocean fertilization, where nutrients are added to the upper layers of water to encourage plankton blooms, which absorb carbon dioxide from the air. That been proven to work, but the method has not been studied for long enough to understand whether side effects (like toxic algae blooms) may outweigh the benefits. Despite limited research and technology development in CDR, the reports authors say the world must remove as much carbon dioxide from the air as possible  while reducing emissions  if warming is to be limited to 1.5 or even 2 degrees. [The report] foresees that in addition to making this pivot to clean energy, that the opportunity is also going to be to remove, through various means, some of the pollution thats already in the system or thats already being poured into the system now, Pete Ogden, the UN Foundations vice president for energy, climate, and the environment, told CNN. Particularly carbon dioxide, because it is so long lasting that to turn the ship around, we really need to use all the tools we can. The bulk of human-induced climate change comes from carbon dioxide, but methane makes up around 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions and is the second-biggest contributor to climate change. The gas has more than 80 times the warming power of CO2 in the short term, and the first installment of the IPCC report published last year found slashing methane emissions was one of the fastest ways to turn down the heat. Methane emissions can come from leaky oil, gas and coal infrastructure and mines. They also come from landfill and agricultural practices  and yes, even from flatulent cows. The concentration of methane in the atmosphere is higher now than any time in at least 800,000 years. One of the biggest takeaways is that in order to minimize the temperature rise, which is getting higher, and from pushing ourselves over potential tipping points and irreversible impacts, we really need to make to pull hard on the lever of methane reduction, Ogden said, because that gives us a near-term opportunity to shave off some of the temperature rise. Last year, the United States and European Union announced a global pledge to reduce methane emissions by nearly 30% by the end of the decade. Since then, around 100 nations joined that pledge. China, the worlds biggest greenhouse gas emitter, has not yet joined. Humans have been using fossil fuels to heat homes, cook food and fuel cars for decades. Over the course of more than a century, fossil fuels became entrenched in every aspect of the economy and peoples lives to the point that theyre often the only option available. Its this heavy reliance on coal, oil and fossil gas that is behind climate change. While individual choices and tracking your carbon footprint have been popular ways for people to respond to the crisis, there is a growing understanding that real change must come from reducing the availability of fossil fuels, not just the demand. The way consumer choices are presented needs to shift dramatically, the report says, because it could help individuals adopt low carbon-intensive lifestyles  plant-based diets, food-waste reduction and renewable energy options, for example  without ultimately pinning all the onus on them. Without support for these changes, the impact of individual action will be modest, the report shows. People either dont have the technologies available or they cant afford them, House said. So part of this is about the architecture of choices, about making choices available to people, so that they can take the decisions that they want to take, but in a sustainable and affordable way. The rate of climate finance  money that rich countries promised to provide developing countries to address the crisis  has slowed down, according to the report, while the financing of fossil fuels remains high. Although climate finance policies have increased over the past several years, the report found wealthy nations must increase the flow of money to low-income nations beyond the existing $100 billion-a-year, promised under international climate agreements. The least developed nations as well as small island nations have historically contributed less than 0.5% of global fossil fuel emissions, according to the report, yet they bear a disproportionate burden of the impacts of the climate crisis. The money contributed thus far has mostly gone toward reducing those countries greenhouse emissions. More of it, scientists say, should go toward adaptation  finding ways to live with the change. At the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow, Scotland, last year, developing nations complained that the worlds richest countries were failing to help them financially, despite having played a negligible role in causing the crisis. Mohamed Adow, director of the climate energy think tank Power Shift Africa, said countries in Africa will play a fundamental role in deciding whether the world avoids catastrophic climate change or not. Africa could be the leading example in avoiding emissions by harnessing our abundant wind and solar energy, Adow, who is not involved with the report, told CNN. This will only be possible with significant financial support and technology sharing from richer nations, whose emissions have caused this crisis.

"To my son, born during the climate crisis: Get mad and get ready","Dear River, Its just over two years since you joined our Little Blue Marble ride through the Milky Way and now that you can say things like Bill Weir I want banana smoothie, its time to learn the difference between Happy Birthday and Happy Earth Day. Both are in April, but one of them has cake and Hopalong Andy and the other, frustration with humanity. Both involve balloons, only on Earth Day we get pick their deflated shards off a beach or festoon them around a protest sign on a march down Broadway. I was a toddler your size when this holiday began, back when the skies of Los Angeles had the look of a neglected fishbowl and a river in Ohio held so much oily pollution that it turned the color of a rainbow and burst into flames. The problems with an economy built on dirty fuels and planned obsolescence were so disgustingly obvious back in my boyhood that leaders from both political tribes agreed to create the Environmental Protection Agency and pass the Clean Air and Water Acts. As you learn more about the Congress of your birth, this will seem adorable. But they were right. Those moves are the reason people can now see the San Gabriel mountains from downtown L.A. and fish in the Cuyahoga River and allow Donald Trump to say that theres no need for environmental regulations because we have the cleanest air, the cleanest water. By the 20th Earth Day in 1990, it was easier being green but the advice of the day included asking the post office to stop sending junk mail and to cut up your plastic six-pack rings to save seagulls from strangulation. Meanwhile, 163 million tons of trash were left by Earth Day festival goers in Central Park. These people didnt leave as much behind as people who attend food fairs do, said a sanitation official at the time. It was an environmentally sensitive crowd. But while we were focused on our most obvious missteps as a species, none of us could see the trillions of tons of planet-cooking, reef-killing fossil fuel pollution pumping invisibly into our seas and sky. And the consequences were too slow-mo to notice. Not anymore. A few weeks after you were born, we entered a hurricane season so active that we ran out of letters in the alphabet to name them and the storms that came a year later were even more costly. On the day you learned to open kitchen cabinets, 15 Giant Sequoias trees that had been swaying with the California winds for 2,000 years couldnt survive 2021. And the week before your 2nd birthday, it was 50F above normal near the North Pole. This should have been alarming enough, but at the same time, it was 70F above normal near the South Pole. Since they are, by definition, polar opposites THIS SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN and going forward at this rate, it can only get worse. At the current carbon pollution levels, River, when you are my age science predicts that the average American city will feel like it has moved over 500 miles south. Anchorage could be warmer by 24F and almost 360% wetter while Washington D.C. would have the heat and humidity of Greenwood, Mississippi. Tucson could jump 10F while losing almost 40% of its already precious precipitation, putting it in the category of Mexican towns in the Sonoran Desert, and Jacksonville, Florida will feel like the northern border of Belize. We dont know how accurate these models will prove to be because, as the scientists like to say, we have no spare Earths to experiment with. This is it. You, your sister, your pal Matilda and the rest of the neighborhood scooter gang are the test subjects. When you look back, youll probably wonder what we were doing with this information beyond recycling junk mail and seagull-safe six-packs, but you should know there were countless good souls ready to pitch in. What can I do? Ive heard in many an airport and at some point I started responding with a list. 1. Get mad. 2. Get ready. 3. Get as many new friends as you can. Step 1 is easy. First, examine your own eco-anxiety (a term that jumped in use by 4,290% in 2019) and then remind yourself that the scientists inside the biggest oil company in the world were eco-anxious back when Saturday Night Fever was in theaters. Internal documents show they predicted exactly what we are seeing now. When you realize that their bosses in the C-suites decided not to tell anyone for decades, that anger will then be a renewable resource and could fuel any number of peaceful actions, from turning urban spaces green to statehouse lobbying to volunteering in places of environmental injustice. Since the climate crisis touches everything, everywhere, follow your passion to a point of action. And this feeds into Steps 2 and 3. In 2019, FEMA completely changed the way they assess flood disaster risk across the country. Instead of just focusing on storm prediction and elevation, they factored in 78 socioeconomic factors from income inequality to high-speed internet access to church membership. Since these determine the speed of recovery, tight, trusting communities on the coast were determined to be less vulnerable than towns 50 miles inland. By throwing Earth out of balance, weve baked ourselves a pie chart with three slices: Mitigation (stopping the problem), adaptation (bracing for the problem) and pain. The relative size of each slice is yet to be determined, but an active, organized community is the one thing that helps ease all three. And nothing scares polluters more. The two years since your birth have been also been packed with a pandemic, insurrection, impeachment, a cold civil war at home, a hot ground war in Eastern Europe and the deliberate erosion of truth. Throw in industrial-sized addiction, distraction and depression and 22 was... a lot. But covering this beat, Ive come to realize that mainlining peer-reviewed doom all day is hazardous to your health. For both sanity and success, we must focus both on the End of Life As We Know It and Life As We Know It Could Be. It wont be a silver bullet that saves what we love, but buckshot blasts of better ideas. And as for Earth Day? Think about it this way: What would life be like if you only showed Mom you love her on Mothers Day? Even if you never gave her pain a second thought the rest of the year, youd only be hurting yourself. Love, Dad",22/04/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/climate-change-bill-weir-letter-to-son-wt-scn/index.html
Google marks Earth Day with doodle showing stark impacts of the climate crisis,"Google is marking Earth Day on Friday with a doodle of time lapses, highlighting how the climate crisis is radically changing the planet. The search engine published a series of time-lapse satellite images from Google Earth, depicting deforestation, melting glaciers, coral bleaching and retreating snow cover, as a stark reminder of humans impact on the climate and environment. The images  four GIFs from four different parts of the world  will each remain on the homepage for several hours at a time throughout the day, Google said in a statement, in a bid to promote global awareness about environmental protection. Users can see how a glacier at the summit of Mt. Kilimanjaro in Tanzania retreated between December 1986 and 2020, as well as glacial melt in Sermersooq, Greenland, between December 2000 and 2020. Another image shows coral bleaching on Lizard Island in Australia from March 2016 to October 2017. A fourth shows forests destroyed by bark beetle infestation due to rising temperatures and severe drought in Elend, Germany between December 1995 and 2020. Earth Day is an annual event held on April 22 to raise awareness for environmental protection. This years theme is Invest In Our Planet, and the new doodle is designed to intensify talks over one of the most pressing topics of our time, Google said. The time lapses are in contrast with last years more optimistic doodle, which had a Restore Our Earth theme. At the time, Google published an animation of a tree being planted, which the company said was intended to show how everyone can plant the seed to a brighter future and find one small act they can do to restore our Earth. Scientists have warned that the world must contain global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrialization temperatures, to avert worsening and some irreversible impacts of the climate crisis. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has released three reports since August, all sounding the alarm that time is running out to get the world on track for averting catastrophic impacts of the climate crisis. To do so, deep, sustained cuts must be made to greenhouse gas emissions, primarily through weaning off coal, oil and gas. Heatwaves, droughts, wildfires and heavy rains that cause intense flooding are becoming more frequent in many parts of the world as it warms. A 2021 report by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) found that across the world, an extreme weather event or climate disaster had occurred every day on average over the last 50 years, a five-fold increase in frequency over that period. Globally, the economic toll of these disasters has climbed seven-fold since the 1970s, the WMO reported.",22/04/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/04/22/world/earth-day-2022-google-doodle-climate-scli-intl/index.html
Twitter bans ?isleading?climate change ads,"Twitter is banning misleading advertisements that go against the scientific consensus of climate change, the company announced on Friday, which was Earth Day. We believe that climate denialism shouldnt be monetized on Twitter, and that misrepresentative ads shouldnt detract from important conversations about the climate crisis, Twitter said in a blog post. Those denying the effects of climate change have targeted sites such as Twitter and Facebook, enabling them to reach hundreds and thousands of those platforms users with false claims. The announced change did not indicate whether Twitter would ban or delete the accounts of users who post climate change misinformation. Twitters blog post cited the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, whose recent report called for immediate and deep emissions reductions to combat the impacts of global warming. The tech giant said it is working toward adding more reliable, authoritative context to conversations about the climate on its platform. Twitters move follows action taken by other tech companies. Earlier this month, Pinterest announced it will prohibit users from sharing climate misinformation on its site, banning the content outright. It will also remove posts that deny climate change. And last year, Google, announced it was banning ads on content from climate change deniers on its platform, as well as prohibiting advertisements that deny climate change. Separately, hours after Twitters policy update, European policymakers reached agreement on sweeping tech regulations that included stricter rules on how platforms regulate misinformation and illegal content on social media and other platforms. Big Tech has been facing increased pressure to combat the spread of climate misinformation on their platforms. An open letter signed by more than 200 scientists, activists and organizations last November called for the CEOs of social media companies including Facebook, Instagram, Google, Twitter, TikTok, Pinterest and Reddit to establish climate misinformation policies similar to the ones they put in place for Covid-19. Last November, Twitter rolled out efforts to preemptively debunk, or pre-bunk, disinformation about such topics as climate change by directing users to online hubs with credible information on its platform. Twitter also joined the EU climate pact earlier in February, committing to increasing efforts on promoting reliable climate information.",23/04/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/04/23/tech/twitter-climate-change-policy/index.html
"India and Pakistan heatwave is ?esting the limits of human survivability,?expert says","Temperatures in parts of India and Pakistan have reached record levels, putting the lives of millions at risk as the effects of the climate crisis are felt across the subcontinent. The average maximum temperature for northwest and central India in April was the highest since records began 122 years ago, reaching 35.9 and 37.78 degrees Celsius (96.62 and 100 degrees Fahrenheit) respectively, according to the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD). Last month, New Delhi saw seven consecutive days over 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit), three degrees above the average temperature for the month of April, according to CNN meteorologists. In some states, the heat closed schools, damaged crops and put pressure on energy supplies, as officials warned residents to remain indoors and keep hydrated. The heatwave has also been felt by Indias neighbor Pakistan, where the cities of Jacobabad and Sibi in the countrys southeastern Sindh province recorded highs of 47 degrees Celsius (116.6 Fahrenheit) on Friday, according to data shared with CNN by Pakistans Meteorological Department (PMD). According to the PMD, this was the highest temperature recorded in any city in the Northern Hemisphere on that day. This is the first time in decades that Pakistan is experiencing what many call a spring-less year, Pakistans Minister of Climate Change, Sherry Rehman said in a statement. Temperatures in India are expected to improve slightly this week with maximum temperatures across northwest India expected to drop by 3 to 4 degrees Celsius (5.4 to 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit), the IMD said. Temperatures in Pakistan are also expected to be closer to average  about 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit)  later this week. But experts say the climate crisis will cause more frequent and longer heatwaves, affecting more than a billion people across the two countries. India is among the countries expected to be worst affected by the impacts of the climate crisis, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This heatwave is definitely unprecedented, said Dr. Chandni Singh, IPCC Lead Author and Senior Researcher at the Indian Institute for Human Settlements. We have seen a change in its intensity, its arrival time, and duration. This is what climate experts predicted and it will have cascading impacts on health. India often experiences heatwaves during the summer months of May and June, but this year temperatures started rising in March and April. In the northern state of Punjab, known as Indias bread basket, thats causing heat stress, not only for millions of agricultural workers, but for fields of wheat they rely on to feed their families and sell across the country. Gurvinder Singh, director of agriculture in Punjab, said an average increase of up to 7 degrees Celsius (12.6 degrees Fahrenheit) in April had reduced wheat yields. Because of the heatwave weve had a loss of more than 5 quintal (500 kilograms) per hectare of our April yield, Singh told CNN Monday. Chandni Singh, from the IPCC and no relation to Gurvinder Singh, said agricultural workers were more likely to suffer from the oppressive heat. People who work outdoors  farmers, those in construction, manual labor  will suffer more. They have less options to cool down and cant stay away from the heat, she said. In some parts of India, demand for electricity has led to a coal shortage, leaving millions without power for up to nine hours a day. Last week, coal stocks at three out of the five power plants Delhi relies on to supply its power reached critically low levels, dropping below 25%, according to Delhis Power Ministry. India canceled more than 650 passenger trains through the end of May to clear tracks for more cargo trains as the country scrambles to replenish coal stocks at power plants, a senior official from the countrys Railways Ministry told CNN. Indian Railways is a key supplier of coal to power plants across the country. Some Indian states, including West Bengal and Odisha, have announced school closures to deal with the rising temperatures. Children who have to traveled to school, many of them are getting nosebleeds, they cant tolerate this heatwave, West Bengals Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee told reporters last week. In recent years, both the federal and state governments have implemented a number of measures to mitigate the effects of heatwaves, including shutting down schools and issuing health advisories for the public. But according to Chandni Singh, more should be done to prepare for future heatwaves. We dont have a heat action plan and there are gaps in planning, Singh said. You can only adapt so much. This heatwave is testing the limits of human survivability.",02/05/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/05/02/asia/india-pakistan-heatwave-climate-intl-hnk/index.html
There? a 50:50 chance the planet will pass the 1.5C warming threshold in the next 5 years,"Theres now a 50:50 chance that the world will surpass a critical threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming in the next five years, a new World Meteorological Organization report shows, warning of heating that could have devastating impacts on systems like coral reefs as well as Arctic ice. The report says that surpassing the limit is likely to be temporary  temperatures could come back down again  but science shows that even a temporary overshoot could bring irreversible changes to the planet. The report warns that at least one year between 2022 and 2026 will surpass the 1.5C mark and that there is a 93% chance that the period will see the warmest year on record. Its also almost certain that, on average, the next five years will be hotter than the last five. In 2015, the chances of world temperatures temporarily exceeding 1.5C over the next five years were close to zero. Those odds have been inching up ever since as humans continue to emit greenhouse gas, primarily from the use of fossil fuels. Scientists have warned that the world needs to limit global warming to 1.5C above the temperatures experienced before industrialization to avoid the more catastrophic effects of the climate crisis. In 2015, most of the world signed onto the Paris Agreement, aiming to limit temperature rise to 2C, but preferably 1.5C. The world is already at least 1.1 degrees Celsius warmer than it was before industrialization. This study shows  with a high level of scientific skill  that we are getting measurably closer to temporarily reaching the lower target of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, WMO Secretary General Petteri Taalas said in a statement accompanying the Global Annual to Decadal Climate Update. The 1.5C figure is not some random statistic, he added. It is rather an indicator of the point at which climate impacts will become increasingly harmful for people and indeed the entire planet. An authoritative climate report published in February by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said that some of the changes that could come as a result of the planet heating up by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius could be permanent  even if the planet does cool back down. Even at 1.5C, many of the worlds coral reefs will be wiped out, and permafrost in some places could reach a tipping point. Permafrost is permanently frozen ground that lies under much of the Arctic, keeping huge stores of carbon dioxide (CO2) locked away. As it melts in warmer temperatures, it releases CO2 and adds to climate change. A single year of exceedance above 1.5C does not mean we have breached the iconic threshold of the Paris Agreement, said Leon Hermanson from the UKs Met Office, which led the report, but it does reveal that we are edging ever closer to a situation where 1.5 C could be exceeded for an extended period. The WMO report was published on the heels of heatwaves in India and Pakistan, which had experts questioning the ability for humans to survive in such high temperatures. In the US, the largest manmade reservoir  Lake Mead  has seen water levels plunge to an unprecedented low over the last two months. Mead is a key source of water for millions of people across California, Nevada and Arizona. In California, which is entirely in drought conditions, two of the states largest reservoirs  Shasta Lake and Lake Oroville  are at critically low levels, according to the US Drought Monitor. The plummeting water levels at the lake are the result of a climate-change fueled megadrought in the American West. A study published by Nature Climate Change found the period from 2000 to 2021 was the driest in 1,200 years in the area. For as long as we continue to emit greenhouse gases, temperatures will continue to rise, Taalas said. And alongside that, our oceans will continue to become warmer and more acidic, sea ice and glaciers will continue to melt, sea level will continue to rise and our weather will become more extreme. Arctic warming is disproportionately high and what happens in the Arctic affects all of us. Ice sheet and glacier melt in the Arctic will lead to accelerated sea level rise, which could be both irreversible for centuries and disastrous for the planet as the risks of extreme flooding increase. The report highlights how fast humans are warming the planet, said Andrew King, a lecturer in Climate Science at the University of Melbourne. Our greenhouse gas emissions are still at near-record highs and until we get emissions down to net-zero, were going to continue to see global warming, he said. Net zero refers to a state where the world reduces its greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible, and offsets any that are hard to avoid, whether through the use of technology or tree-planting to capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. King added: If we fail to take that action we will have much worse heatwaves and bushfire conditions as well as coral reefs that have been decimated beyond recognition.",10/05/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/05/10/world/climate-warming-warning-wmo-intl-scli/index.html
"Climate change doubled chance of South African floods that killed 435 people, analysis shows","Human-induced climate change made the extreme rainfall that triggered deadly floods in South Africa in April heavier and twice as likely to happen, a rapid analysis published Friday by the World Weather Attribution project shows. Parts of South Africa experienced more than 350mm of rainfall in two days, causing destructive floods in KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape provinces, killing at least 435 people and damage to property worth around $1.57 billion. The Port of Durban, Africas largest port, was forced to halt operations due to the floods, causing disruptions in supply chains. Most people who died in the floods lived in informal settlements, so again we are seeing how climate change disproportionately impacts the most vulnerable people, said Friederike Otto from the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London, who leads the World Weather Attribution (WWA) project. However, the flooding of the Port of Durban, where African minerals and crops are shipped worldwide, is also a reminder that there are no borders for climate impacts, she said. What happens in one place can have substantial consequences elsewhere. The scientists analyzed weather data and computer simulations to compare todays climate, which is around 1.2 degrees Celsius warmer than temperatures before industrialization, with the climate of the past. They also concluded that an extreme rainfall episode such as the one in April could now be expected to happen about once in every 20 years. Without human-caused global warming, such an event would only happen once every 40 years, so it has become about twice as common as a result of greenhouse gas emissions, the group said in a statement. It added that these extreme rainfall events are expected to be 4-8% heavier than in the past. If we do not reduce emissions and keep global temperatures below 1.5o C, many extreme weather events will become increasingly destructive, said the WWAs Izidine Pinto, from the Climate System Analysis Group at the University of Cape Town. We need to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to a new reality where floods and heatwaves are more intense and damaging. Scientists have warned that the world must try to cap global warming to 1.5C to stave off some irreversible impacts of climate change. In southeastern Africa, warming of 2C is projected to bring an increase in the frequency and intensity of heavy rain and flooding, and an increase in the intensity of strong tropical cyclones, which are associated with heavier rainfall.",13/05/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/05/13/africa/south-africa-floods-climate-intl/index.html
The ?ucky country?is facing a crucial test. The result will affect us all,"Ken Morrison has twice been up to his neck in water during climate disasters. The first time, in 2007, he was trapped in a pool with a towel over his head as wildfires ripped through Australias Hunter Valley, a wine-growing region about three hours drive north of Sydney. The roar is unbelievable. You can feel the oxygen getting taken out of the air, recalled the 57-year-old paramedic, who was on the job treating volunteer firefighters for burns and broken bones at the time. The second incident was this February, when relentless rain burst the banks of the Richmond River, sending a tsunami-like wave surging through the small town of Woodburn in northern New South Wales, where Morrison lives. He waded in darkness to free a boat stored in the back shed so his family could escape the floodwater. Im in total darkness. I got leeches all over me. Covered, he told CNN, standing in boots caked with mud in his backyard after a second flood in April. Australia has long been known as the lucky country, partly due to its wealth of coal and gas, as well as minerals like iron ore, which have driven generations of economic growth. But its now sitting on the frontier of a climate crisis, and the fires, floods and droughts that have already scarred the country are only expected to become more extreme as the Earth warms. Despite its exposure to the crisis, Australia has one of the worst records on climate action in the developed world, with plans under the current government to cut emissions by just 26-28% from 2005 levels by 2030  a target that pales in comparison to those set by its allies in the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union. Even the Business Council of Australia, which represents companies including mining interests, supports a higher target. On May 21, Prime Minister Scott Morrison (who is of no relation to Ken Morrison) will be asking Australians to re-elect his center-right Liberal Party and its ally, the Nationals, in a coalition government, after a three-year term bookended by climate-related disasters: The Black Summer fires in 2019-20 that razed bushland covering an area equivalent in size to the UK, claimed dozens of lives and killed or displaced roughly three billion animals. Then the floods this year that swamped Ken Morrisons home and so many others like it in New South Wales and further north in Queensland. But the Prime Ministers bid for a second term could be thwarted by his main rival, Labor Party leader Anthony Albanese, whos promising to cut emissions by 43% by 2030. Saturdays vote is a pivotal one  it will either provide a mandate for more of the same, or set the country on a different path. According to the Ipsos Climate Change report, a survey of 1,000 voters in the last week of March showed that four in five were concerned about the crisis, and two-thirds thought the country should be doing more about it. But public surveys have been wrong before. In 2019, opinion polls predicted a win for the opposition center-left Labor Party and its ambitious plan to boost the use of renewables and electric cars. But Labor lost, and the vote only vindicated the coalitions inaction on climate. While current polls show Labor is on track to win this election, the crisis is now competing with other problems that appear more immediate  the cost of living, the rise of China and inflation among them. Ken Morrison says hes not sure who hell vote for, but he knows it wont be either of the main parties: Liberal and Labor, theyre the same horse with different stripes. Before he became prime minister, Scott Morrison cemented his position as an unflinching ally of the fossil fuel industry when he wielded a lump of coal in parliament to taunt the opposition about its renewable energy policy. This is coal. Dont be afraid. It wont hurt you! he bellowed over jeers. It is coal that has ensured for over 100 years that Australia has enjoyed an energy competitive advantage. That was five years ago, but the Australian government has been on the record as an international holdout on climate action since 1997, when it strong-armed delegates during the landmark Kyoto talks to secure a deal to not only avoid cutting its net emissions but to actually increase them to 108% of its 1990 levels by 2012. Australia relies on fossil fuels to power its economy, and in the last 10 years, the mining industry has earned 2.1 trillion Australian dollars ($1.5 trillion USD) in export revenues, amounting to 21% of total GDP growth. While much of the world is working on a green recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, Australia is considering more than 100 new fossil fuel projects, many of which could go online within the next decade. If all fossil fuel developments under consideration in Australia went ahead, they could collectively contribute an extra 1.7 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions each year, according to research by independent think tank The Australia Institute. That is a lot of greenhouse gas  more than three times the amount Australia already emits, and nearly double of what all the global aviation produces in a year. The federal government has long supported coal and gas with subsidies that amounted to 10.5 billion Australian dollars (US$7.2 billion) in the 2021-22 budget, and now, its economic recovery plan is decidedly gas-fired. Among its new gas projects and pipelines is the Scarborough to Pluto development in Western Australia, which will emit between 1.37-1.6 billion tons of greenhouse gasses in its lifetime, including emissions sent offshore. Thats equivalent to nearly 15 new coal-fired power stations, according to recent analysis. Australia appears intent on replacing fossil fuels with fossil fuels, notes a scathing assessment from the Climate Action Tracker, which monitors climate commitments by governments. On paper, both major parties say they want to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 and are promising to spend around 20 billion Australian dollars ($14 billion) to get there. For the coalition, that means more gas projects and investing in emissions-reducing technologies like carbon capture and storage (CCS), a method of trapping and storing carbon from fossil fuels to allow for their continued use. But the technology is not 100% effective, and scientists have warned against using it to meet climate goals. For Labor, reaching net zero means overhauling the electricity grid, offering discounts on electric cars, and creating new solar banks and community batteries. But Albanese hasnt ruled out more coal projects, saying that applications will be approved if they stack up environmentally, and then commercially  a nod to how politically popular supporting coal mining jobs is among the partys traditional voting base. The Greens are promising to phase out the mining, burning, and export of thermal coal by 2030 and end fossil fuel subsidies, but as a minor party its influence will be limited unless its candidates can secure enough seats to sway a hung parliament. Back in Woodburn, northern New South Wales, some residents are still living in tents and caravans pitched in front of mud-stained houses 11 weeks after the first flood in February. Having lost everything, it would be easy to assume theyd tilt towards parties promising greater climate action. But not necessarily. Tamara Collins, a remote nurse who lives near Ken Morrisons house, said shell vote Labor, but only because their local candidate answered the phone when she and her husband, Tim Phillips, were scooping toxic mud from the floor of their newly renovated house. Cam Hollows, a doctor and the son of prominent eye surgeon Fred Hollows, lives and works in the region. As water rushed into homes, he took a helicopter to remote communities cut off by floodwater to help with relief efforts. A lot of people that live in the bush dont choose to live here because theyre lucky in life, he said. The lucky country has a lot of unlucky people. About a third of the nations 26 million people live outside major cities in regional towns and villages. The cost of living is typically lower, but life in rural Australia can be hard. There are fewer jobs and prolonged droughts have robbed many farmers of their livelihoods. Hollows describes the two very different classes in Australia in terms of caravans: Theres the $80,000 caravans towed behind $100,000 cars and caravans that havent had wheels for 40 or 50 years. Some are used for extended holidays, others are permanent homes. Woodburn is in the federal electorate of Page, a safe seat held by the National Party, the Liberal Partys conservative coalition partners, who typically represent regional voters. In Page, Hollows expects the Liberal National Coalition to bleed yellow, a reference to the United Australia Party, which is making its pitch to voters on bright yellow billboards on roads and highways around the country. The right-wing party is a collection of candidates led and bankrolled by Clive Palmer, the brusque former mining magnate who has promised to Make Australia Great! on a platform of capped mortgages and pulling all Australian investments out of Europe and the US. Palmer has no climate policy at all. At the opposite end of the ideological scale to Palmer sit the Independent teal contenders, named after the color most have chosen to use in their campaigns, who are launching challenges in 22 predominantly marginal electorates. And almost all of the candidates are women. Their plan is to take inner-city seats held by Morrisons government by offering climate action to fiscally conservative voters who wont back Labor but are tired of the coalitions business-as-usual approach to fossil fuels. While these candidates are independent, all are backed by Climate 200, an organization pushing to elect Independent voices capable of negotiating larger emissions reduction targets. One of the teal candidates is Jo Dyer, an Australian theater and film producer, who decided to run for office after becoming frustrated with what she described as the revolving door between Australias political class and the fossil fuel industry. Climate change is seen as some sort of ideological issue here as opposed to an impending global crisis  its been reduced to part of the culture wars, Dyer told CNN during a meeting in her local seat of Boothby, a collection of suburbs in the nations driest state of South Australia, which encompasses rugged coastline and sprawling foothills. At a climate forum hosted by Dyer, local resident Cheryl Lange said she was fed up with the lack of urgency of the major parties. Im voting for a climate candidate because the big parties are under the thumb of the fossil fuel companies. Theres no sense at all of the urgent need to take action, she said. In Dyers view, this is a last-chance election  one which could reveal uncomfortable truths about Australias priorities. People often say this is not who we are as a country, Dyer said. Well, if this government is rewarded, wed have to say, actually this is exactly who we are. The landmark Paris agreement in 2015 saw 200 nations put their differences aside with a promise to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century  a commitment that was strengthened at last years summit in Glasgow. But neither of Australias major parties are currently coming to the table with targets that are consistent with those goals, according to climate scientists. The coalitions targets are currently in line with nearly 4 degrees Celsius of warming globally, while Labors path would see a 2 degrees Celsius temperature rise, according to Climate Analytics, led by one of Australias top scientists, Bill Hare. Hare is acutely aware of the existential threats facing his nation, but says if enough climate-conscious candidates win their seats and apply pressure in Parliament, the election could be transformative. Underneath this horrible inaction lies an enormous opportunity to be a leader in clean energy, Hare said, explaining that a lot of the things Australia does to enable mining and gas extraction are very relevant to the rapid scaling up of the basic supply infrastructure needed for renewables. On top of having the tools to harness more renewable energy, Australia has the natural resources to provide it, with more solar potential per square meter than any other continent, and some of the best wind assets in the world. Renewable energy already accounts for almost 33% of the nations power, according to the sectors peak body. And states like South Australia  where two-thirds of electricity is generated from wind and solar  have been world-leading in their transition away from fossil fuels. But back in Woodburn, where the sound of yet more rain keeps locals awake at night, voters like Ken Morrison are banking on self-reliance as they stare down the barrel of more extreme weather events, rather than any kind of change in government. The boat that he once stored in the back shed now lives in the garage beneath his two-story home, ready in the event of a flash flood. And the kayak, he said, so we can get in and out quickly.",18/05/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/05/17/australia/australia-election-climate-crisis-intl-hnk-dst/index.html
Climate change is making record-breaking heatwaves in India and Pakistan 100 times more likely,"Climate change has made the odds of a record-breaking heatwave hitting northwestern India and Pakistan 100 times more likely to happen, scientists said Wednesday, as the two countries experience high temperatures that are disrupting daily life. In an analysis, climate scientists with the UKs Met Office found that the natural probability of a heatwave exceeding average temperatures from 2010 would be once in 312 years, but when climate change is factored in, the chances increase to once in every 3.1 years. April and May in 2010 was used as a point of comparison because those months had the highest average temperatures since 1900. Soaring temperatures in parts of Pakistan and India in recent weeks have forced schools to close, damaged crops, put pressure on energy supplies and kept residents indoors. It even prompted experts to question whether such heat is fit for human survival. Jacobabad, one of the hottest cities in the world, in Pakistans Sindh province, hit 51 degrees Celsius (123.8F) on Sunday, and 50C (122F) the day before. In neighboring India, temperatures in the capital region of Delhi surpassed 49C (120F) on Sunday. The analysis also made projections, showing the frequency of such heatwaves in the region would increase to increase to once every 1.15 years by the end of the century. Spells of heat have always been a feature of the regions pre-monsoon climate during April and May. However, our study shows that climate change is driving the heat intensity of these spells making record-breaking temperatures 100 times more likely, said the Met Offices Nikos Christidis, who produced the analysis. By the end of the century increasing climate change is likely to drive temperatures of these values on average every year. India and Pakistan are highly vulnerable to the impacts of the climate crisis, particularly in terms of extreme heat. Chandni Singh, from the IPCC, said earlier this month that there was a limit to how far humans could adapt to such heat, adding that the heatwave was testing the limits of human survivability. The scientists said that a new temperature record was likely to have been reached in the region during the recent heatwave. Temperatures in the sub-continent have eased slightly in recent days, but the respite is likely to be short-lived, according to Paul Hutcheon, of the Met Offices Global Guidance Unit. The heat looks likely to build again from mid-week, peaking later in the week or into the weekend, with maximum temperatures again likely to reach 50C in some spots, with continued very high overnight temperatures, he said on the Met Offices website. Through the weekend temperatures are likely to lower again closer to average. There is also a continued enhanced risk of fires (largely from planned agricultural burning) in the region which would further add to the poor air quality. Some strong winds will lift dust plumes at times too.",18/05/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/05/18/asia/climate-india-pakistan-heatwave-intl/index.html
Human-induced climate crisis is making Japan? cherry blossoms bloom earlier,"Every spring, crowds flock to admire Japans cherry blossom  a dazzling pink and white bloom that has been revered in the country for more than a thousand years. But the world-famous sakura plants are flowering much earlier than normal due to human-induced climate change, a new study has found. Researchers from the Met Office in the United Kingdom and Osaka Metropolitan University in Japan say the climate crisis and urban warming have pushed forward the peak bloom flowering period by 11 days. In 2021, cherry blossoms in the historic central city of Kyoto peaked on March 26  the earliest full flowering date in 1,200 years. This year, the cherry blossoms burst into color on April 1. The scientists, who published their findings in the journal Environmental Research Letters on May 20, said that extreme early flowering of the cherry blossoms is now more common. The trend of earlier peak blooms coincides with rising temperatures. Average March temperatures in Kyoto city center have increased by several degrees since pre-industrial times, under the influence of both climate change and urban warming, the scientists observed. Part of the reason is increased urbanization. Cities tend to be warmer than surrounding rural areas because buildings and roads absorb the suns heat more than natural landscapes  a phenomena known as the heat island effect. But scientists say a bigger reason is the climate crisis, in which the burning of fossil fuels has caused rising temperatures across the region and the world. If planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions continue as they are, by the end of the century Kyotos cherry blossoms could start arriving even earlier  by almost another week, the study found. Our research shows that not only have human-induced climate change and urban warming already impacted the flowering dates of cherry blossom in Kyoto, but that extremely early flowering dates, as in 2021, are now estimated to be 15 times more likely, and are expected to occur at least once a century, said lead author and Met Office climate scientist, Dr. Nikos Christidis. Such events are projected to occur every few years by 2100 when they would no longer be considered extreme. Earlier cherry blossoms have wider ramifications for Japans economy and ecology, and are a symptom of the larger climate crisis threatening ecosystems everywhere. Spring cherry blossom flowering is a culturally significant event in Japan, said contributing author Yasuyuki Aono, from Osaka Metropolitan University. Spring festivals that accompany the blooms are an important contributor to the local economy, so being able to predict the blooms timing can be critical. The peak bloom period lasts just a few days. During this period, hanami  Japanese for flower viewing  is a popular activity. It is common for locals and tourists alike to have picnics under the cherry trees, and businesses will sometimes offer special set meals or products during the week. But its not just a matter of tourists scrambling to catch peak bloom before the petals all fall  it could have a lasting impact on entire ecosystems, and threaten the survival of many species. The impact of rising temperatures on natures calendar has trickle-down effects on farming and land management practices in the country, the study said. It also impacts plants, insects and animals, which rely heavily on each other for their development and life cycles. A change to this cycle can initiate a chain reaction, causing damage to ecosystems. For instance, plants sense the temperature around them and if its warm enough for a consistent period, they start to flower and their leaves start to emerge. Similarly, higher heat can cause faster growth in insects and other animals. Different plants and insects may respond to the rise in heat at different paces, throwing their life cycles out of sync. Whereas they once timed their growth simultaneously each spring, now flowers may bloom before insects are ready, and vice versa  meaning there may not be enough food for the insects or plants. The change in flowering dates isnt limited to Japan or to cherry blossoms. This year, spring came early in parts of the United Kingdom and climate change is making plants across the British Isles flower, on average, a month earlier than they used to, according to a recent study. The same phenomenon is already happening to many crops and economically valuable plants  posing big problems for food security and farmers livelihoods.",20/05/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/climate-crisis-cherry-blossom-kyoto-japan-intl-hnk-scn/index.html
Australians voted for stronger action on climate change. Will they get it?,"On his first full day on the job, Australias new prime minister mentioned the words climate change four times within two minutes of his maiden international speech. Fresh from election victory, Anthony Albanese sought to present a new Australia to the world, one that takes climate change as seriously as defense, after decades of inaction. At the Quad meeting in Tokyo on Tuesday, Albanese told his counterparts from the United States, India and Japan that climate and the security of the region were among the biggest challenges of their time. The new Australian governments priorities align with the Quad agenda, taking action on climate change and building a stronger and more resilient Indo-Pacific, Albanese said, in words broadcast around the world. But experts say it wont be easy to turn around a coal-powered ship that has for years been chugging in the wrong direction, partly fueled by a government earning billions of dollars in export revenue. The powerful fossil fuel lobby could fan headwinds, as could those aligned with the former Liberal-National government  a center-right-conservative coalition  though after years dominating the Australian parliament, their voices are likely to be drowned out by a cohort of Greens and climate-motivated independents who made big gains in the weekend vote. Change appears to be coming in Australia, but the new government needs to convince the nation that the climate crisis presents an opportunity, not a threat to jobs, said Frank Jotzo, director of the Center for Climate and Energy Policy at the Australian National University (ANU). What the government should do is to talk deeply about climate change as an opportunity to help create better economic opportunities for the younger generation, Jotzo said. A government that wants to change things needs to establish a narrative that is overwhelmingly strong against the inevitable lobbying by powerful vested interests. For years, Australians had been sold the idea that turning away from fossil fuels would damage the economy, but this election suggests the fear of economic ruin has been replaced by something else. The message from Labor, Greens and climate-minded independents was that too much time had already been lost, though they disagree about the size of emission cuts needed to put the country back on track. Four days after the vote, with ballots still being counted, Labor was close to reaching a 76-seat majority in the House of Representatives, meaning the party wont need to rely on alliances to pass legislation. Albaneses government aims to cut emissions by 43% by 2030, but hell no doubt be pressured to raise that target by the Greens and independents, whether Labor has a majority or not. The parliament now effectively has a super majority in support of climate action which cant be ignored, said Ben Oquist, the executive director of The Australia Institute think tank. However, even as Australia plans larger cuts to emissions, more than 100 fossil fuel projects from the previous government are still under consideration. If all go ahead, they could add 10% to Australias baseline emissions in the next decade, according to research institute Climate Analytics. While Labors climate goals are far more ambitious than the previous governments, Albanese hasnt exactly rung the death knell for coal, the most carbon intensive of fossil fuels. The future for natural gas, also a planet-warming fossil fuel and one of Australias biggest exports, is yet to be laid out. Bill Hare, founder of Climate Analytics and one of the nations leading climate scientists, told CNN that its still unclear if Labor will cut subsidies for fossil fuels, potentially affecting the viability of some projects. My impression is that these companies are still in a powerful position to push ahead with pending projects, and theres a very strong gas lobby inside the Labor party, Hare said. Oquist said pressure is likely also to be exerted on the government in the other direction, by parties and the public who dont want new coal and gas projects to go ahead. That debate against opening new coal mines and new gas fields is set to intensify, Oquist said. Propping up new coal and gas is going to be on the nose politically. Theres some debate over whether the government support for fossil fuels amounts to subsidies. According to a 2020 report by think tank the International Institute of Sustainable Development, the vast majority of the Australian governments previous support for the fossil fuel industry was through forgone tax  reduced tax rates or exemptions. Adam Bandt, the leader of the Greens party, which increased its presence in the lower and upper house, is pushing for money to be redirected from fossil fuel companies to public spending. If the next government wants to know where the money can come from to fund things like getting dental into Medicare (Australias universal health care scheme) ... stop giving the big coal and gas corporation handouts, he told reporters Monday. Thats how we can make a better life for Australians. Labors target to reach net zero emissions by 2050 will also rely heavily on a $20 billion investment in renewable energy, including solar banks and community batteries. But it cant do that without overhauling the countrys infrastructure to modernize the electricity grid, distribution networks and switching stations. The question is whether this will be an investment or a direct budget expenditure  Im not sure what their plan is, but were facing the most challenging budget environment since the 1950s, so theres going to be challenges, Hare said. Without that capital, the rollout of renewables will be slower. The Albanese government has promised discounts on EVs, but Australians ability to charge them will again partly depend on the governments plan to rewire the nation. The countrys aging distribution network  poles and wires  arent sophisticated enough to deal with the extra power needed to charge electric cars at home, according to research by the University of Melbourne. Australia also has a lot of catching up to do when it comes to acquiring electric cars. Just three years ago, in his pitch for reelection, former Prime Minister Scott Morrison claimed electric vehicles would ruin the weekend. Theyre still a relatively rare sight on Australian roads, though demand is currently outstripping supply, according to industry body the Electric Vehicle Council. The group says Australias poor fuel efficiency standards create little incentive for carmakers to build the market, and the country ends up as a dumping ground for the worlds dirtiest vehicles. The Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries says Australias fuel standards are two decades behind the rest of the world, which also limits car owners access to the latest engine and exhaust technology to reduce emissions on the road. Jotzo, from ANU, said as well as lifting the rates of EVs through discounts and other incentives, the government needs to tax high-polluting cars and trucks. This is really big picture fiscal reform because it sets it up for gradually moving away from the fuel excise as a major revenue source, he said. To date, most of the inroads Australia has made on cutting emissions have been driven by the states and territories. In the absence of leadership from the federal government, theyve introduced their own policies and targets. Jotzo said the challenge for Albanese will be to pull together the separate state-based strategies into a single, united national plan. If you just let states do their own thing, then you end up with state versus state competition and a truly horrible patchwork of different rules and regulations in different states, which is really not what you want, he said. Such a fundamental shift in climate strategy after nine years of conservative rule will take time to unfold, but that could work in Labors favor, Jotzo added. Some of the bigger things will quite obviously be left to a future parliament, Jotzo said. Electorally that would be attractive to Labor  it would set them up with an agenda to take the next election. But if they dont get the strategy right, he warns, Labor will be the next party vulnerable to challenges from Greens and independents. In the meantime, the government needs to focus on ensuring Australians who rely on coal and gas for their livelihoods arent left behind, Hare said. You can see the mood has changed since 2019 in coal regions, they want a plan, he said. Theyve worked out coal is being phased out, and they want to start seeing the alternatives.",25/05/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/05/25/australia/australia-election-climate-analysis-intl-hnk-dst/index.html
"Historical emissions caused the climate crisis. But it? what we do today that will make or break it, study shows","Humans historical greenhouse gas emissions have caused the climate crisis the world is in today. But its the amount emitted now and in coming years that will determine whether humanity can avert catastrophic climate changes. Thats the main finding of a new study published in the journal Nature Climate Change on Monday, which says that even if the world cut emissions to zero today, there would still be a 42% chance of hitting 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming above pre-industrial levels within a decade. That probability rises to 66% if the world waits until 2029 to reach zero emissions. Nevertheless, achieving zero emissions this decade is shaping out to be a pipe dream at this point, considering global emissions are still climbing, and set to continue for the next several years. A UN report showed that new and updated pledges on emissions will only cut around 7.5% from current rates by 2030. Additionally, China, the worlds largest emitter, is not set to reach zero emissions until 2060. The study also shows that if the world emitted nothing today, there is only a 2% chance of breaching the higher, more severe, 2 degrees Celsius warming threshold. But that too increases to much more likely than not  66%  if the world waits another 35 years before hitting zero emissions. If zero emissions were achieved today, temperatures would peak within a decade, the study shows, and as the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere slowly decline, long as they remain low, that peak will be followed by a long and slow period of cooling. According to the study, future warming is governed primarily by future emissions rather than by past emissions, and thus society is not geophysically committed to exceeding key global warming levels before reaching them. The findings send both a sobering message that the world needs to expedite its goal of reaching net zero, where as little greenhouse gas is emitted as possible, and the rest is offset. But it also sends a hopeful message: that there is still a good chance of keeping the climate crisis in check if deep, sustained cuts to emissions are made. And the sooner the better. What this study has taught me is that the window of opportunity to reduce our emissions to avoid temporary exceeding 1.5 degrees is rapidly closing, Kyle C. Armour, co-author of the study and associate professor of oceanography and atmospheric sciences at the University of Washington in Seattle, told CNN. We have to [slash emissions] almost immediately. Armour adds that he believes focusing on limiting 1.5 degrees C as a policy goal may no longer be realistic, and that the world has a better shot at addressing 2 degrees. Thats my personal view, just because that window of opportunity is so short  and it really has to happen this decade, he said. Reducing emissions to zero is not practical at the global scale. The flip side is Im very optimistic about holding warming to near or below two degrees because we have several decades to get this figured out. Early this year, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its latest scientific evidence showing that if the world gets 1.5 degrees hotter than levels before industrialization  even temporarily  some impacts could take thousands of years to reverse or, in some case, be irreversible altogether. That includes highly vulnerable ecosystems in the Arctic, mountains and on the coasts. Ice sheet and glacier melt, for instance, will accelerate sea level rise. Forests, peatlands, and permafrost  places where greenhouse gas is naturally absorbed and stored  will also be at risk of becoming emitters, leading to far more warming. At 2 degrees C of warming, as many as 18% of all land species will be in danger of extinction. For humans, as many as 3 billion people globally will experience chronic water scarcity, according to the IPCC. The world is already at least 1.1 degrees C warmer than pre-industrial levels. The scientists who authored the study used climate modeling to estimate the Earths temperature change if emissions were reduced to zero in 2021 and every year after until 2080, under different scenarios. Researchers also took into account the role of different greenhouse gases and their concentrations in the atmosphere, as well as aerosols and ozone depletion. While burning fossil fuels is the main driver of climate change, the aerosols  tiny particles of air pollution that are emitted  also have a cooling effect, though not enough to counteract the negative impact of coal, oil and gas use. Although much of the global focus has been on slashing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, which is critical to ending the climate crisis, Armour said solutions need to also take into account short-lived climate forcers, such as the greenhouse gas methane and aerosols. Because we are committed to a few tenths of a degree more warming as we lose our aerosols, those aerosols are currently masking that warming, he said. What that means is that were geophysically committed to these temperature levels, like 1.5 and 2 degrees, about five or 10 years before we would actually reached those levels, if we continue to our emissions; because as we continue our emissions, we continue our aerosol pollution. Kim Cobb, director of the Global Change Program at the Georgia Institute of Technology, said the study is proof that understanding the evolution of the different types of emissions matters. With respect to our ability to predict the timing and magnitude of peak warming, this paper shows that the devil is in the detail, Cobb, who is not involved with the study, told CNN. That may seem fairly in the weeds, but when youre talking about a few tenths of a degree Celsius, thats a big deal in terms of global warming levels. Cobb said the latest study not only builds on existing climate research, but also underscores what many in the scientific community already knew to be true. We only have a handful of years to slash emissions for any hope of limiting global warming to 1.5C, Cobb said. This opportunity is slipping through our fingers with each additional year of inaction.",06/06/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/06/06/world/climate-warming-emissions-study-intl/index.html
"Climate crisis costs up over 800% as UN donor nations fail to keep pace, report says","The amount of money needed to aid communities in the face of extreme weather-related emergencies has increased by more than 800% in the past two decades as the climate crisis also rapidly accelerated, new research shows. The report, released Tuesday by Oxfam, found not only is the need for extreme weather-related UN humanitarian funding now sharply higher than 20 years ago, but donor nations are also failing to keep up with the staggering costs of the climate crisis. In 2021, the economic toll of extreme weather events was roughly $329 billion globally  the third highest year on record and almost double the total aid donated by wealthy nations to poorer countries that same year. Between 2000 and 2002, the UN needed an average of $1.6 billion in funding each year for humanitarian projects after extreme weather events. By 2019 through 2021, it was seeking an average of $15.5 billion each year  an increase of more than 800%. Additionally, the report shows that for every $2 needed to address climate change-fueled disasters, wealthy donor countries are only providing half of that. Climate change is harming, and will continue to harm, Black, Indigenous, and people of color and other vulnerable communities first and worst  disrupting their livelihoods, culture, health, and way of life, Russell Armstrong, Oxfam Americas senior climate policy adviser, told CNN. Even though the economic toll of climate change, estimated between $300 billion and $500 billion globally, is on par with government subsidies for fossil fuels, calls for solutions have gone unheard, he added. Since 2017, roughly 54% of the developed countries responsible for the causes of the climate crisis today have met these UN humanitarian appeals, leaving a deficit of up to $33 billion. From addressing wars to food scarcity around the globe, researchers say the climate crisis is putting even more pressure on an already financially-strained UN humanitarian system. The impact of climate change-fueled disasters exacerbates inequalities already baked into a countrys physical and social infrastructure, mostly hitting low-income nations the hardest. Such countries typically lack the proper infrastructure and money needed to recover from disasters. According to the report, the countries with the most recurring appeals regarding extreme weather crises include Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Kenya, Niger, Somalia, South Sudan and Zimbabwe. Meanwhile, rich countries such as the United States continue to emit more of the emissions that fuel these extreme weather events. As the biggest historical emitter of carbon pollution the US has an obligation to the global community to prioritize the fight against climate change and help foot the bill on the costs of destruction from extreme weather, Armstrong said. According to the report, the UN humanitarian appeals only cover a small fraction  roughly 7.5% or 474 million of the estimated 3.9 billion people  of low- and middle-income nations that have been plagued by climate change-fueled disasters since the beginning of this century. The report was published as ministers meet in Bonn, Germany, for climate talks to discuss the issue of loss and damage, essentially the payment of funds from the wealthy world to countries dealing with more severe impacts of the climate crisis.",07/06/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/06/07/world/climate-emergencies-funds-un-report-intl-hnk/index.html
The West just experienced an aspect of the climate crisis that scientists have warned of for years,"The West saw an aspect of the climate crisis play out this month that scientists have warned of for years. In the middle of a prolonged, water shortage-inducing megadrought, one area, Yellowstone, was overwhelmed in mid-June by drenching rainfall and rapid snowmelt that  instead of replenishing the ground over a matter of weeks or months  created a torrent of flash flooding that ripped out roads and bridges and caused severe damage to one of the countrys most cherished national parks. In the meantime, drought conditions persisted in the Southwest, where water is desperately needed to replenish the countrys largest reservoirs, and provide relief to regions tormented by record-setting wildfires. The latest update in the US Drought Monitor on Thursday showed the major contrast between the wet Northwest and the hot and dry Southwest. This feast-or-famine contrast is a pattern the climate crisis tends to amplify: extremes on both ends of the spectrum, with the pendulum sometimes swinging suddenly from one side to the other. Across the Pacific Northwest, drought conditions improved significantly over the past several weeks, with the areas in severe drought falling from a high of 55% in April to 25% this week. Much of the Northern Tier states experienced beneficial rainfall and near to below-normal temperatures, predominantly leading to drought improvements from the Pacific Northwest to the Northern Plains, the Drought Monitor noted. But this persistent and active storm track, which continues to bring rain and snow to the Northwest, has largely missed California and the Southwest. The US Bureau of Reclamation projected this week that Arizona, Nevada and California would see even more significant cuts to their Colorado River water allotments starting next year. Federal officials make those determinations on a year-by-year basis every August. Lake Mead, the nations largest reservoir which serves millions of people in the Southwest, is already running well below what last years projections suggested, even in its worst-case scenario. Last August, the bureau predicted the reservoir would most likely be at 1,059 feet above sea level at the end of this month, and 1,057 feet at worst. But its now around 1,045 feet. In New Mexico, where two of the largest fires in state history are still burning, the drought summary noted that temperatures were running around 5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit above average, which are worsening drought conditions in parts of western and southern New Mexico. More than 50% of the state is in exceptional drought, the highest classification in the drought monitor, up from zero in January. This extreme dryness is playing a major role in fueling a fire year that is pacing to be the worst on record. A recent study from the federal governments Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico found that parts of the Upper Colorado River Basin, including the states of Colorado, Wyoming and Utah, will see earlier peak streamflow because of earlier rapid snowmelt, and up to 60% reduction in snow in the coming decades. Were definitely looking at a hotter future, Katrina Bennett, hydrologist with the lab and lead author of the study, told CNN. There will be more of that wet to dry sort of scenarios were seeing, but regardless, were going to see more minimum streamflow, increase in drier soils and lower snowpacks, which all together will lead to likelihood of drought increasing across the board especially in the upper areas where we really havent seen that intense drought stress yet.",16/06/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/06/16/us/southwest-drought-flooding-climate/index.html
Abu Dhabi Fossil Dunes: A beautiful frozen landscape created by climate change,"Drive an hour or so southeast out of the city of Abu Dhabi toward the emirates empty deserts and youll hit a landscape full of unexpected man-made creations. The region of Al Wathba is home to a beautiful oasis-like wetland reserve created, so the story goes, by an overspill from a water treatment facility. Now its a lush terrain that attracts flocks of migratory flamingos. Farther along roads lined with carefully planted trees, theres the surreal site of an artificial mountain rising up on the horizon, its flanks buttressed by gigantic concrete walls. And stray off the main roads onto the back lanes, youll encounter wide and dusty camel highways, where cooler evening temperatures see vast fleets of the humped beasts being exercised in readiness for the winter racing season. But one of Al Wathbas more unusual and elegant attractions is not the work of humans. Instead its been crafted over tens of thousands of years by elemental forces that, though they were at play millennia ago, offer insight into how the current climate crisis might reshape our world. Abu Dhabis fossil dunes rise up out of the surrounding desert like frozen waves in a violent ocean made of solid sand, their sides rippling with shapes defined by raging winds. Though these proud geological relics have survived for centuries out in the middle of nowhere, they were opened as a free tourist attraction in Abu Dhabi in 2022 as part of efforts by the emirates Environment Agency to preserve them within a protected area. Whereas Instagrammers and other visitors once needed all-terrain vehicles to ride up to the fossil dunes in search of a dramatic selfie backdrop, they now get a choice of two large parking lots that bookend a trail which meanders past some of the more spectacular landmarks. Along the way are informative signposts that give some bare-bones information on the science behind the dunes creation  essentially, moisture in the ground caused calcium carbonate in the sand to harden, then powerful winds scraped them into unusual shapes over time. But theres far more to it than that, says Thomas Steuber, a professor in the Earth Science Department of Abu Dhabis Khalifa University of Science and Technology, who spent much of the Covid lockdown studying the dunes while unable to travel to other areas of geological interest. Its a pretty complex story, Steuber tells CNN. Abu Dhabis Environment Agency dates the fossil dunes at between 120,000 and 150,000 years old. Steuber says that generations of dunes were created by cycles of ice ages and thaws that occurred between 200,000 and 7,000 years ago. Ocean levels dropped when frozen water increased at the polar caps and during these drier periods, dunes wouldve built up as sand blew in from the drained Arabian Gulf. When the ice melted, leading to a more humid environment, the water table rose in what is now Abu Dhabi and the moisture reacted with the calcium carbonate in the sand to stabilize it and then form a kind of cement, which was later whipped into ethereal shapes by prevailing winds. The Arabian Gulf is a small basin thats very shallow, says Steuber. Its only about 120 meters deep, so at the peak of the ice age, about 20,000 years ago, there was so much piled up on the polar ice caps that water was missing from the ocean. That meant the Gulf was dry and was the source of material for the fossil dunes. Steuber says that the fossil dunes, which occur throughout the UAE and can also be found in India, Saudi Arabia and the Bahamas, likely took thousands of years to form. But, despite the official protection now offered in Abu Dhabi, the erosion that gave each its unique shape will also eventually lead to their demise. Some of them are quite massive, but in the end the wind will destroy them. They are essentially rocks, but you can sometimes break them with your hands. Its quite a weak material. Which is why, at Al Wathba, visitors are now being kept some distance from the dunes, although still close enough to appreciate their impassive beauty. Touring the site is best in early evening when harsh daytime light is replaced by a golden glow from the setting sun and the sky takes on the lilac hues of magic hour. It takes about an hour to stroll along the sandy path from the visitor center and souvenir stall to the parking lot at the other end  and about 10 minutes to shortcut back. The untouched serenity of the dunes is contrasted at some points along the trail by a chain of gigantic red and white electricity pylons that stride over the horizon in the distance. Rather than spoil the scene, this engineering spectacle adds a dramatic modern dimension to a landscape otherwise frozen in time. As dusk settles, some of the dunes are illuminated, offering a new way to view these geological marvels. The dunes look really amazing, said Dean Davis, visiting the site during a day off from work in Abu Dhabi city. Its nice theyre being conserved and the government has done a great job. Ashar Hafeed, another visitor touring with his family, said he was also impressed. I saw it on Google and just needed to come and take a look, he said, adding that once was enough to appreciate the dunes. Stauber and his team from Khalifa University are likely to be repeat visitors though. Were continuing to study them, he says. There are quite a few interesting questions about sea-level changes during the recent ice ages still to answer and its very important for understanding the current geomorphology of the coastline of the Emirates. Its also obviously an analog for future sea-level change. And, says Steuber, the dunes could be evidence of the inspiration behind the tale of Noahs flood, which features in the Koran, the Bible and the Torah, the texts of the three major religions to emerge from the Middle East. Possibly, this was the flooding of the Arabian Gulf at the end of the ice ages, because the sea level rise was very rapid. With a dry Arabian Gulf, the Tigris and Euphrates rivers wouldve discharged into the Indian Ocean and what is now the Gulf would have been quite a fertile low lying area which 8,000 years ago wouldve been inhabited, and people may have experienced this rapid sea level rise. Perhaps it led to some historic memory that made the holy books of these three local religions.",23/06/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/abu-dhabi-fossil-dunes/index.html
Supreme Court curbs EPA? ability to fight climate change,"The Supreme Court curbed the Environmental Protection Agencys ability to broadly regulate carbon emissions from existing power plants, a major defeat for the Biden administrations attempts to slash emissions at a moment when scientists are sounding alarms about the accelerating pace of global warming. In addition, the court cut back agency authority in general invoking the so-called major questions doctrine  a ruling that will impact the federal governments authority to regulate in other areas of climate policy, as well as regulation of the internet and worker safety. The decision issued Thursday will send shockwaves across the federal government, threatening agency action that comes without clear congressional authorization. The ruling was 6-3. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the opinion for the conservative majority, with the three liberal justices dissenting. Roberts said that our precedent counsels skepticism toward EPAs claim that the law empowers it to devise carbon emissions caps based on a generation shifting approach. Under our precedents, this is a major questions case, Roberts wrote, adding that there is little reason to think Congress assigned such decisions to the Agency. Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law, said the ruling could be cataclysmic for modern administrative law. For a century, the federal government has functioned on the assumption that Congress can broadly delegate regulatory power to executive branch agencies. Todays ruling opens the door to endless challenges to those delegations  on everything from climate change to food safety standards  on the ground that Congress wasnt specific enough in giving the agency the power to regulate such major issues, Vladeck said. Regarding the EPA, Roberts wrote that capping carbon dioxide emissions at a level that will force a nationwide transition away from the use of coal may be a sensible solution. But it is not plausible that Congress gave EPA the authority to adopt on its own such a regulatory scheme under the law in question. A decision of such magnitude and consequence rests with Congress itself, or an agency acting pursuant to a clear delegation from that representative body, he wrote. Writing separately, Justice Neil Gorsuch emphasized the courts move to limit agency power, which he considers unaccountable to the public. While we all agree that administrative agencies have important roles to play in a modern nation, surely none of us wishes to abandon our Republics promise that the people and their representatives should have a meaningful say in the laws that govern them, Gorsuch wrote. Justice Elena Kagan, writing for the dissenters, sounded the alarm about global warming and said that the courts decision strips the EPA of the power Congress gave it to respond to the most pressing environmental challenge of our time. The Court appoints itself  instead of Congress or the expert agency  the decision-maker on climate policy, she wrote. I cannot think of many things more frightening, she concluded. The White House on Thursday blasted the ruling. This is another devastating decision from the Court that aims to take our country backwards, a White House official said in a statement. While the Courts decision risks damaging our ability to keep our air clean and combat climate change, President Biden will not relent in using the authorities that he has under law to protect public health and tackle the climate change crisis. Meanwhile, US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said the ruling is a public health disaster that will hurt Americans health. A failure to regulate power plant emissions will lead to increases in asthma, lung cancer, and other diseases associated with poor air quality, and in many places, those impacts are likely to fall hardest in already heavily polluted neighborhoods, Becerra said. The opinion calls into question the future of federal-level climate action in the US, and puts even more pressure on Congress to act to reduce planet-warming emissions. But broad action from Congress is unlikely. Democrats in Congress have been embroiled in difficult negotiations on a climate and clean energy bill with their main holdout, Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia for months, with no clear end in sight. Its unclear whether those negotiations on a package of clean energy tax credits and other emissions-cutting programs will yield a result. And without both major investments on clean energy and strong regulations cutting emissions by the EPA, President Joe Biden has very little hope of meeting his climate goal, independent analysis shows. Congressional Democrats also expressed fury at the courts decision and warned of the environmental consequences. Democratic Rep. Raul Grijalva of Arizona, who chairs the House Natural Resources Committee, said the court has sentenced our planet to death. Make no mistake, this decision  and all of the decisions this week  will be directly responsible for the harm and deaths of countless Americans, he said. Democratic Sen. Ed Markey, who proposed the Green New Deal, said the decision lets polluters turn back the clock on fifty years of reduced pollution and improved air quality all across the country. The result of this dangerous decision is an EPA that is undermined in its ability to protect the public, he said, adding that Congress should pass meaningful climate and clean energy funding and the climate justice and clean energy package. Vladeck said the lack of congressional willpower will lead to the erosion of federal power. It would be one thing if Congress could be expected to respond to this ruling by updating all of those delegations to make them more specific, but we  and the Court  know that it wont, which will almost surely lead to significant deregulation across a wide swath of federal authority. Fossil fuels in the power sector are a huge contributor to the climate crisis. Around 25% of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions around the globe and in the US come from generating electricity, according to the EPA. And coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, powers about 20% of US electricity. Emissions from power production rose last year for the first time since 2014, an increase that was mainly driven by coal use. The surge in fossil fuel use is worrying not only for Bidens climate goals  the President in his first months in office pledged to slash US emissions in half by 2030  but also the planet. Scientists have become increasingly urgent in their warnings that to make headway on the climate crisis, emissions need to not only be reduced going forward, but the world needs to develop ways to also remove the greenhouse gas thats been pumped into the atmosphere in decades past. In a landmark report last year, scientists reported that the planet is warming faster than they had previously imagined it would. As it does, they said, extreme weather will become more deadly; water crises will develop and worsen; food insecurity will grow and disease will spread. To avoid the worst consequences, the world must limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (its already passed 1.1 degrees), and the only way to do that is to keep the vast majority of the Earths remaining fossil fuel stored in the ground. Central to the case was the section of the Clean Air Act concerning the scope of the EPAs ability to regulate power plants. The Obama administration interpreted the provision broadly in a way that would justify regulations on a statewide basis. The Trump administration, however, said the EPAs authority is much more narrow and that it could only target requirements aimed at making individual power plants more efficient. The DC Circuit vacated the Trump rule in 2021 holding that it rested on a fundamental misconstruction of the law. The Biden administration is currently working on a new rule. Because there is no current EPA rule on power plant emissions on the books, court watchers were surprised when the Supreme Court agreed to take up a challenge to the lower court opinion brought by Republican-led states. West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey was the main plaintiff in this case, joined by Republican attorneys general from more than a dozen other states. He was joined by lawyers representing two coal companies: The North American Coal Corporation, and Westmoreland Mining Holdings, LLC. The plaintiffs challenged the EPAs authority to broadly regulate greenhouse gas emissions coming from power plants and said this power should be taken away from the agency and given to Congress. They said a provision of the Clean Air Act did not give the agency such broad authority, and citing a legal principle called the major questions doctrine, the challengers said that such decisions with such sweeping implications had to have Congress clear authorization. On the other side, Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar argued that the petitioners case should be dismissed because there is no federal regulation for power plants on the books right now  with both the Obama-era Clean Power Plan and the Trump-era Affordable Clean Energy rule dead. The EPA has not yet issued a new rule. Morrisey on Thursday said the court made the correct decision to rein in the EPA, an unelected bureaucracy. We are pleased this case returned the power to decide one of the major environmental issues of the day to the right place to decide it: the U.S. Congress, comprised of those elected by the people to serve the people, he said. This is about maintaining the separation of powers, not climate change. West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, a Republican, also celebrated the ruling, saying that it will stop unelected bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. from being able to unilaterally decarbonize our economy just because they feel like it.

How the climate crisis is forever changing our national parks,"When Garrett Dickman drove through Yosemite National Park early this week, he passed through a diverse band of large trees  conifer, red fir, lodgepole pine  and noticed a grim pattern: many of the trees were either dead or dying. It was really striking to see that every single tree seems to be getting hit by either climatic changes; it could be dying from drought, or it could be insect attack or fungus, but theyre certainly weakened, Dickman, a forest ecologist with the National Park Service, told CNN. Theres a big shift happening right now, and its right in front of our eyes. The consequences of the climate crisis  more wildfires, devastating drought, sea level rise, flooding, ecological disease  are plaguing the countrys national parks. Most recently, unprecedented flash flooding overwhelmed Yellowstone National Park and some of its surrounding areas. Scientists and officials say it signals a dramatic change unfolding at the nations most prized parks. And unless the planet slashes fossil fuel emissions, scientists believe the climate crisis could drastically alter the landscapes, cultural sites and ecosystems in the parks, potentially making them inaccessible for humans and uninhabitable for other species. What happened at Yellowstone is also a classic example of the climate crisis converging with failed emergency disaster response, said Marcy Rockman, a former climate change adaptation coordinator for the Park Service. When I heard they were evacuating every visitor from Yellowstone, I was like, Oh my god, evacuating every visitor was not a part of our climate change scenarios,  Rockman told CNN. Seeing what my former colleagues at Yellowstone are having to deal with now, its like ... Im worried for them. That the parks climate change response now involves how do you evacuate everyone from a park is just a gut-punch that I dont think we had fully taken in when we started the climate program, she said. As more climate change-fueled events occur, CNN talked to Park Service officials and scientists to see how the climate crisis may alter the ecosystems and landscapes of some of the countrys most beloved national treasures. Climate change has already touched one of the Sierra Nevadas most valuable sites. Yosemite National Park has been forced to close several times in recent years because of extreme heat, deadly wildfires or dangerous air quality from fire smoke. The average temperature in Yosemite may increase by up to 10 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century, which is several degrees higher than global temperatures are predicted to surge. And its not a future threat. Park rangers and scientists have already observed the shrinking snowpack, dried-up waterfalls, increasing fire activity and more tree die-offs like those Dickman observed. People come to Yosemite because we have some of the biggest trees on Earth, Dickman said. But the whole experience in Yosemite is starting to be altered ... Were just kind of seeing that tree line lift up in a weird way. As average temperature increases, it increases the elevation of where trees can grow. Dickman said forecast models show this part of the Sierra Nevada could look more like the mountains around Los Angeles, where trees can grow at a higher elevation because of the warmer temperatures. Studies have also showed the range of small mammals in Yosemite has shifted upslope over the last century as the area warmed. Dickman told CNN even 10 years ago he was concerned about different threats, pointing to how the park dealt more with flooding from powerful storms coming off the Pacific Ocean and less with dangerous wildfires. For our preparedness now, its really going to be around fire, and to get fire back on the ground in a good way to ward off some of the effects of these climate- and fuels-driven fires, he said. Scientists at Glacier National Park are bracing for its namesakes to disappear entirely. If you wanted to see a glacier, go to Glacier National Park in Montana, Beissinger said But you better get there soon, because the glaciers are going to be gone from Glacier National Park, probably sometime in the next decade or two. Theyve been disappearing. In the past 50 years, some of the Montana parks 26 glaciers have lost as much as 80% of their area. Loss of glacier ice is a huge threat for aquatic ecosystems within the park that rely on cold freshwater. It also threatens the surrounding area with increased flooding. Much like the flooding at Yellowstone in June, the climate crisis is expected to trigger more flooding at Glacier. As Yellowstone closed down to visitors during its flooding disaster, officials at Glacier warned visitors their park was also experiencing dangerous water levels. Melting glaciers are also a significant source of sea level rise. Caitlyn Florentine, a research physical scientist at the US Geological Survey who studies US glaciers, noted the glaciers at Glacier National Park are already quite small. But when taken together with other glaciers globally under a warming climate, they are enough to cause significant sea level rise around the planet. The meltwater from these glaciers affects the streams that are very high in the alpine environment, Florentine told CNN, pointing to a study which found the presence or absence of glacier meltwater will be felt by water in the rivers that feed agricultural communities to the east of the park. Given the rate at which climate change is accelerating, researchers say the timing of the loss depends highly on how much fossil fuel we burn in the future. Just south of the Yosemite Valley in California, the Wests megadrought is weakening and destroying the nations largest, oldest trees in Sequoia National Park. Six fires over the course of six years burned more than 85% of the giant sequoia grove acreage across the larger Sierra Nevada, compared to around 25% over the previous 100 years, the National Park Service reported. Three of those fires crossed into Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks, forcing officials to close the parks to the public and take dramatic steps to protect the trees. In September 2021, park biologists wrapped the base of General Sherman  the planets largest living tree  in protective foil as the flames of the KNP Complex fire approached. General Sherman is estimated to be anywhere from 2,200 to 2,700 years old, and has grown to 275 feet. The trees diameter is more than 36 feet at its base, which is about as wide as six average cars. Park scientists have already seen major effects of climate change, said Christy Brigham, chief of resource management and science at Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks, mainly in the form of hotter, drier droughts and how they fuel extreme wildfires. We had a historic superintendents building burned down in a recent wildfire, Brigham told CNN. So those kinds of impacts are already happening in lots of national parks, and will continue to happen. Brigham added the climate crisis is already changing our day-to-day operational business of managing our national parks. Besides maintaining public amenities and ensuring endangered species are safe, she said park employees  who have also been personally impacted by wildfires  are working even harder to clear up trails and engage in new emergency response systems to prepare for events such as fire risks. People who work in these places like me and all the other staff really care deeply about keeping these places the spectacular environments that they are for the enjoyment of visitors, and we are seeing changes, Brigham said. I came to Sequoia National Park from a different Park in 2015, and we were already seeing lots of dead trees from hotter drought, and thats only been made worse by the wildfires. National parks, like Sequoia National Park, is a place where we share values, as Americans, in terms of our heritage, she added. Its a place where we can connect and see the impacts and maybe make some choices to reduce those impacts in the future. The impact of warmer temperatures, severe lack of rainfall and stunted streamflow on the Colorado River is alarming at Grand Canyon National Park, said Mark Nebel, the parks geosciences program manager. The climate crisis is critically altering the Arizona parks ecosystems, habitats for species, as well as its hydrology, Nebel told CNN. Were seeing snow melting about a month earlier than it did a century ago, and theres evaporation as well, and that really affects the levels of water in the [Grand Canyons groundwater] aquifer, Nebel said. Were concerned about how it will affect the springs, which are our drinking water source, as well as the vast majority of the biodiversity around the springs. Vaseys Paradise Spring is one which has gone from consistently reliable to bone dry. The Wests megadrought has devastated the Colorado River, which is a vital resource for the national park. Increased flooding, rock slides, wildfires, and heavy storms also pose severe challenges to Grand Canyons cultural sites, infrastructure, surrounding communities, fisheries and other wildlife. Because of a hotter and drier climate, as well as aging infrastructure, Nebel said the park is changing the source of their water supply from groundwater, which has long relied on one of Grand Canyons springs, to surface water supply elsewhere. The plummeting level of Lake Powell upstream on the Colorado River  the nations second-largest reservoir  is affecting species in the river downstream and at the park according to Nebel. With the water level lowering at Lake Powell, these warm-water invasive fish that are normally near the surface are coming through the dam and getting into the Grand Canyon National Park and threatening native fisheries, he said. Our fisheries folks have been working really hard to remove like invasive trout from streams, where these native fish reproduce. Nebel acknowledge for most visitors who are only there for a few days, the impacts of climate change in the park are largely imperceptible. Its different for the park researchers and staff who live with them day in and day out. For most of us who work at Grand Canyon, we see these crises, we see the danger, we see the damage, Nebel said, and we see that its gonna get worse. For Steve Beissinger, ecology professor at the University of California in Berkeley, national parks like Joshua Tree in Southern California are vital for scientific research. But over the years he has seen how climate change has threatened the parks biodiversity by pushing many species  including small mammals and birds  toward the brink of extinction. When we go back and resurvey places [in Joshua Tree] that the early scientists at UC Berkeley visited a century ago, we find about half as many birds, and thats because its warmed and dried so much, Beissinger told CNN. What were seeing is a whole kind of change in a community; a collapse in the case of birds. For park managers, theres limits of what they can actually do to reverse this because of the climate change effects. The extreme heat, dire lack of rain and drought conditions at Joshua Tree have triggered a decline in several species, including the cactus mouse, kangaroo rat, mountain quail and other bird species. Joshua trees themselves are also at risk. Scientists have concluded the western Joshua trees could lose up to 90% of its current habitat in the Mojave Desert by as early as 2070. In mid-June, the California Fish and Game Commission considered whether to list the tree under the states Endangered Species Act. The four-person commission was split down the middle and so failed to secure a majority vote to give the species protected status. Jane Rodgers, chief of science and resource stewardship at Joshua Tree National Park, said theyre fortunate to have some longer term data which is hard to come by for land managers to be able to inform and make decisions. She said such comprehensive data allows park managers to b proactive rather than reactive to extreme weather and drought. We are looking at a holistic portfolio of things we can do to protect these areas, Rodgers told CNN. Its not just continuing to collect data, but also protecting these areas by managing fuels or creating fuel breaks, so that firefighters have a higher probability of stopping a fire. We want to be prepared for that ahead of time as much as we can. As US national parks in the West continue to be plagued with drought, the opposite is taking shape in the eastern end of the country. Everglades National Park in southern Florida is disappearing because of sea level rise. The vast wetlands are now half their original size not only due to rising sea levels but also rampant urban development. Researchers with the National Park Service have observed an increase in water level at some inland, freshwater areas in the Everglades over the last 50 years, on par with the pace of rising seas in the region. The park has also been battered by intense hurricanes in recent years. The Everglades, which encompasses 1.5 million acres of mangroves, marshes and upland forest, is a critical buffer, absorbing the fury of tropical storms. Hurricane Irma pummeled the region in 2017, and the Everglades took much of the storms wrath and protected inland communities. But scientists warn the barriers wont be around for much longer. Because of the dramatic changes seen in US national parks, Dickman said people should make climate-conscious choices to help preserve the landscapes for future generations. The history of America is painted [in these parks], anything from some of the good in our history, some of the bad of our history, and it protects some of the most incredible landscapes on Earth, Dickman said. I have traveled around the Earth and it is hard to go to a place more beautiful than the national parks of America. And we so owe the next generation the ability to experience these places as we have.",02/07/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/02/us/national-parks-climate-extreme-weather-impacts/index.html
"Sydney is flooded, again, as climate crisis becomes new normal for Australia? most populous state","On a fine day, locals arrive on boats that motor up the Hawkesbury River in New South Wales to dine on the back deck of the Paradise Cafe. But for the fourth time in 18 months, cafe owner Darren Osmotherly is rushing to move his equipment to higher ground as floodwater rises across Greater Sydney after days of heavy rain. Every six hours to eight hours (were) trying to have a hot shower and get changed again and try to have a coffee break room or a short sleep in between, said Osmotherly, who says hes barely slept for three days. When Osmotherly opened the cafe 15 years ago to give disabled people on houseboats an easy place to moor for lunch, the property in Lower Portland hadnt flooded in 30 years. But this is the fourth flood since last February, and the most recent since March. We built it all floodproof to cop a flood every now and then, but to have four floods... he said. Flooding in Australias most populous state has become the new normal, as residents in the Greater Sydney area contend with increasingly erratic seasonal swings. The area, which is home to 8.12 million people, or around a third of the countrys total population, has always experienced some degree of flooding during the early summer months. But what was previously a once-in-a-generation event has become commonplace, raising questions as to the long term sustainability of flood-prone communities. More than half a meter of rain (1.6 feet) has drenched parts of eastern New South Wales during the last 48 hours, with spills from numerous dams causing flood warnings across the region. In western Sydney, the Warragamba Dam  Australias largest urban reservoir  started overflowing at 2 a.m. Sunday, and at its peak 515 gigalitres was flooding over its walls  the same amount of water held in Sydney Harbour. A spokesman for the states water authority says the dam doesnt have a flood mitigation component, so no water was released ahead of the downpour, which came when the states dam network was already 97% full. He said the dam wasnt to blame for the flooding. Its quite an extraordinary weather event. Warragamba does spill into a particular river system for sure, but there are a whole vast areas of Sydney that are flooded that arent downstream of Warragamba, the spokesman said. Its a startling turnaround from just 15 years ago when the state decided to build a desalination plant to safeguard Sydneys water supply after years of drought. But this year the La Nina weather system generated more rainfall, and the Bureau of Meteorology says theres a 50-50 chance of it forming later in 2022  twice the normal likelihood. The climate crisis is expected to increase the frequency and intensity of both La Nina and El Nino, which causes drought  that means, if La Nina does form again this year, there could be yet more rain. For locals of Greater Sydney, flooding has become a recurring nightmare. Many are still recovering from the last flood in March, when water swamped many of the same areas, forcing businesses to shutter and rescuers to wade through putrid mud to help trapped residents. The event caused $4.8 billion in damage, making it the countrys third most expensive disaster ever, according to the Insurance Council of Australia. Hundreds of millimeters of rain fell over the weekend, and there was still more to come, Carlene York, the New South Wales State Emergency Services (SES) Commissioner, warned Monday. Were not out of the danger yet in this significant weather event, York said. Id remind people please make sensible decisions that keep you and your family safe. More than 70 evacuation orders were issued for the wider Sydney region Monday, covering more than 30,000 people, and just days into the school holidays when many families would be traveling, millions of others were advised to stay home. Please avoid any essential travel. If you do have to travel please expect that you will have delays theres a lot of roads cut... and theres a lot of detours in place, York said. Jane Golding, from the Bureau of Meteorology, said some areas of Greater Sydney had received more rain than they would for the entire month of July. The numbers are comparable to (the rainfall in) March. What is different in this event is that the rain was stacked up over several days, and that increases risk of how rivers respond, she said. Along with heavy rain, winds of up to 100 kilometers (62 miles) an hour have been recorded on land, and gale force warnings are in place off the coast, where there are waves of up to five meters (16 feet). The dangerous conditions forced authorities to abandon efforts to rescue 21 crew members trapped on a Hong Kong-registered cargo ship, the Portland Bay, which was stranded without power off the New South Wales coast. Instead state police said a tug boat was dispatched to tow the ship further out to sea, where the Australian Maritime Safety Authority would attempt to restore its power. With the election of the federal Labor government in May, Australia is attempting to chart a new course in response to the climate crisis. And on recent trips abroad to meet world leaders, Primer Minister Anthony Albanese has been at pains to stress the country now takes climate change seriously. Every leader who Ive met over recent days has indicated a welcoming of Australias changed position, Albanese told reporters on Friday after meeting OECD leaders in Paris. Australia has now officially signed up to reduce emissions by 43% on 2005 levels by 2030, but after decades of inaction by previous governments, theres a lot more work to be done. Greg Mullins, a former Commissioner of Fire & Rescue NSW and the leader of the Emergency Leaders for Climate Action (ELCA) group, warned last month that, with catchments saturated and dams at capacity, more needed to be done to prepare for floods. In a six-point plan presented to the government, the group said it was short-sighted and unsustainable for Australia be spending more money on disaster response and recovery than measures to reduce the risk. According to analysis released by the Australian Conservation Foundation before the election, federal budget spending on environment and climate programs fell by nearly a third under the previous Coalition government. Climate Council CEO Amanda McKenzie says Australia is under-prepared for climate disasters, and needs to spent more money on building resilience in the most vulnerable regions. Only a very small fraction of disaster spending is committed to preparedness and resilience building. We would expect to see a big shift in this ratio to see a much bigger focus on preparedness given the escalating risk of climate-fuelled disasters, she said. New South Wales has its own climate change fund that spent more than 224 million Australian dollars ($153 million) in 2020-21 on programs to helping communities to become more resilient  including the 140,000 people who live in the Hawkesbury-Nepean Valley, the states most vulnerable location for flooding. That includes cafe owner Osmotherly, who says authorities could do more to ease the flooding risk by better managing dams so that they dont overflow and send more water into already flooded areas. He plans to get a local group together to better understand how the dam operates. But right now, there are more pressing issues. Osmotherly says around 100 people are trapped in their homes along a 10 kilometer (6.2 mile) stretch of road near the cafe  including an 80-year-old man, who has packed up his belongings and is waiting in his caravan for help to get out. So far Osmotherly said he cant see any local rescue services in the area, and he plans to bring the elderly man home to sleep at his house. At the moment, theres no road access into here, he said. Ive got a rescue boat that we can get people in and out. But pretty much theres nowhere to go.",04/07/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/04/australia/sydney-floods-damage-evacuation-climate-australia-intl-hnk/index.html
The federal office focused on health impacts of climate crisis has no permanent staff or funding,"President Joe Bidens first sweeping executive orders on climate included launching an entirely new office within the Department of Health and Human Services with an important mandate: dealing with the public health impacts of climate change. But nearly a year after the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity was established, it still has not been funded by Congress. With no full-time staff, the office is instead getting temporary employees assigned from other parts of HHS to work on its initiatives, which include tackling extreme heat, air pollution from wildfire smoke, flooding, and working with disadvantaged communities that suffer disproportionately from climates impacts. Officials at the office told CNN they cant do the job properly without funding and more resources, especially as human-caused climate change worsens extreme weather. Public health decisions have to be based on the realities of climate change, and the [office] needs resources to make that happen at the federal level, said Adm. Rachel Levine, assistant secretary for health at HHS, in a statement to CNN. Levine pointed the recent spate of early season heat waves that have affected tens of millions in the US. This week alone, as many as 80 million people were under heat alerts as the heat index climbed to as high as 115 in the Midwest and South. Heat is one of the most pernicious climate change-related killers and as global temperatures continue to rise, its only expected to get worse. Scientists from Duke University and the University of Washington recently found that the US could see as many as 100,000 more heat-related deaths per year as temperatures soar. Were seeing right now what extreme temperatures can do to human health and environmental quality, Levine told CNN. We cant respond effectively at the Department of Health and Human Services without funding, staffing and political support, and Im hoping Congress recognizes the value and importance of what were trying to build here. The office has made do with the few resources it has, according to Aaron Bernstein, the interim director C-CHANGE at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. But he said Congress needs to recognize the seriousness of the threat. It would be as if 9/11 happened and we didnt create the Department of Homeland Security, is essentially what were doing, Bernstein told CNN. At its inception in August 2021, administration officials vowed the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity would fulfill President Bidens vision to combat the climate crisis and the devastating health impacts brought by extreme heat and wildfire smoke. Weve always known that health is at the center of climate change, and now were going to double-down on a necessity: fighting climate change in order to help protect public health in our communities, HHS Secretary Xavier Beccera said in August. Bidens budget request to Congress asked for $3 million to fund eight full-time positions at the office. It has yet to receive any appropriation. A House Appropriations Committee spokesperson noted the office would be funded under the fiscal year 2023 budget that recently passed out of committee, but that budget also needs to be agreed to in the Senate, where Republicans arent not sympathetic to Bidens climate goals. CNN spoke with two HHS officials who requested anonymity because they werent authorized to speak publicly on the topic. Both officials said the team is making progress on a shoestring budget, but need Congressional funding to fulfill the mission it was tasked with. Weve kind of scraped and borrowed to piece together a team, one official said. With zero full-time staff, the climate office instead has been loaned detailees from other agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Institutes of Health. But their time there could be temporary. Detailees typically stay at a new office for 120 days, after which they need approval to continue. Political appointees in the departments climate office will only stay as long as Biden remains in office. Another official added the office is hoping to make some full-time staff hires in the coming months. But without dedicated funding, a stream of temporary detailees could slow down projects and make it difficult for states and local communities to keep up with who is in charge. Theres a long history of going out and talking and not being able to provide sustained support, and I dont want this office to be repeating that at all, that official said. Those who work in OCCHE readily admit it was never intended to be a massive office with billions in funding. Instead, they see it as a nimble agency that can coordinate work in other departments that deal with climate change and its disasters but dont often communicate  like the CDC and FEMA. Federal bureaucracies, their silos were built up well before climate change was considered a major issue, Bernstein told CNN, adding that up until this year, FEMA didnt consider extreme heat as a disaster. The reality is climate is affecting health right now, and for lots and lots of Americans. Even with few resources, HHS officials say that theyve been able to make progress. In addition to publishing informational climate health outlooks on extreme heat and doing outreach to impacted communities, the office is also actively working with major health care organizations and hospitals to try to decarbonize the health care sector. It recently announced major pharmaceutical companies and hospitals, including Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Kaiser Permanente, agreed to cut emissions 50% by 2030 and get to net-zero emissions by 2050. What weve stitched together in less than a year is a commitment from the US towards major greenhouse gas reductions in the health sector, an HHS official CNN. I can tell you with 100% surety, that would not have happened without us working here. Other big focuses have been coordinating funding for cooling assistance for areas struggling with heat or getting air purifiers and better air filtration to communities dealing with wildfire smoke. Another official told CNN the office is looking at existing government grant programs like the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program or Medicare Flex cards being used to provide air filters for people in communities where wildfires are burning. Thats something you could do without a ton of money in your pocket, but with people that know where the right kind of levers are, that official said. With the second major heatwave of the summer season baking the Midwest and Southeast this week and fires continuing to rage in the Southwest and Alaska, the health impacts of climate are clear and urgent. At the end of the day, if governments do not carve out these types of offices or people that are working intentionally on climate and health, were going to fail, an HHS official told CNN.",08/07/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/08/politics/hhs-climate-office-funding/index.html
"Researchers just gave developing nations a scientific basis for legal action against US, China for climate damages","Researchers in a new study have put actual dollar figures on economic harm caused by the countries most responsible for the climate crisis, and the ground-breaking data could serve as a starting point for legal action against the worlds wealthiest nations. The Dartmouth College study found that just five of the worlds top emitters of planet-warming gases  the United States, China, Russia, India, and Brazil  caused around a $6 trillion loss in gross domestic product from 1990 to 2014, adjusted for 2010 dollars, or about 11% of total global GDP. The study also shows the US and China  the two biggest contributors to the climate crisis  individually caused global economic losses of more than $1.8 trillion each during that same period. The studys authors said this is the first time scientists have connected the dots between one countrys fossil fuel emissions and the economic harm those emissions have done to other countries. Before our work we had a pretty good idea of the economic effect of global warming. The problem is, that is not sufficient to provide an understanding of how culpable individual actors are, said Christopher Callahan, a PhD candidate at Dartmouth College and co-author of the study. Callahan said the new work puts numbers to it, drawing out specifically what [a countrys] contribution has been. US Climate Envoy John Kerrys office did not respond to CNNs request for comment on the study. CNN has also reached out to Chinas Ministry of Ecology and Environment for comment. The scientists work could be a touch paper during negotiations leading up to and during the COP27 UN climate summit later this year in Egypt. An adequate resolution on so-called climate finance  funds for developing countries to adapt to the climate crisis and transition away from fossil fuels  has been elusive at past summits. Even more controversial has been the idea of loss and damage, or payments from countries that have caused the most harm to those that have suffered the consequences. The studys authors and outside experts said it will ultimately be up to lawyers and politicians to decide what to do with these numbers. Loss and damage and climate finance are expected to loom large in discussions at COP27 in November. Vulnerable island nations that face rising seas and increasingly deadly extreme weather have become more vocal in recent years, sounding alarms about their urgent need to adapt and the responsibility bigger economies like the US, China and the European Union bear in the crisis. I think it could make a splash ahead of COP27, said Taylor Dimsdale, the program director for risk and resilience at international climate think tank E3G. Any discussion about responsibility is harder if you dont have this kind of a model. Ultimately, these are political decisions. The countries most responsible for the harm to poorer economies tend to be those that have burned the most fossil fuel and emitted the most planet-warming gas, the study shows. The US and China were far and away the largest emitters, according to the report, followed by Russia, India, and Brazil. (The EU is typically near the top of the global emitters list, but the studys authors divided the EU up into single countries, rather than calculating it as a bloc.) The countries that have been hurt the most by the worlds largest economies are predominantly in the Southern Hemisphere, the study shows, where the average temperature was already hot even before the climate crisis. One of the challenges is the abstraction that global warming presents. What is increasingly clear is that those impacts are not felt equally across the world, said Justin Mankin, an assistant professor of geography at Dartmouth and a co-author of the study. Bangladesh, for instance, is a low-elevation coastal country on the front lines of rising sea levels and the flooding that comes with it. It has also suffered from deadly extreme heat and humidity. The study points to the US and China as the top climate sources of the countrys economic harm. The US is responsible for $14.1 billion of Bangladeshs economic losses from 1990-2014, while China is responsible for $13.6 billion, its data shows. Mankin said many countries are in the same boat as Bangladesh, and you can throw a dart at the map and hit any country in the tropics to find one with a similar plight. Things arent necessarily the same further north. For instance, the study authors found that the economies in colder regions  like Canada, Russia and Scandanavian countries  have benefited from global warming to a certain extent. Warming temperatures have extended growing periods for crops and opened new shipping channels in previously frozen parts of the Arctic. But its not all positive up north. Climate change has also caused wildfires in parts of Europe and Siberia, and has melted permafrost and has fueled dangerous heat waves. Representatives from countries around the world will meet again at the annual UN climate summit in November to negotiate solutions to the crisis. One of the thorniest issues at this conference will be the idea of loss and damage  that countries which have historically contributed the most to the climate crisis should pay for the harm that crisis has done to poorer, developing nations. The worlds wealthiest countries have already agreed to pay into a global climate finance fund  one to be used by the developing world to adapt to the impacts and transition away from fossil fuels, though countries have shirked deadlines on payments to that fund. But loss and damage has been a bridge too far at past summits. I think, obviously, the United States remains concerned about not opening up some legal track with respect to liability, and we dont intend to do that, Kerry said before the start of COP26. At the end of the conference, Kerry told reporters the US supported the idea of loss and damage, but still noted concern about the issue of liability. Having a rich set of data to show how much poorer nations economies have been harmed could increase the pressure on richer nations at this years summit, experts told CNN. I do think that moves things along in providing this drumbeat thats becoming difficult to ignore if youre a decision maker in a rich country, Dimsdale said. Others told CNN that conversations have moved away from who exactly is liable for the crisis and toward what should be done to solve it. Pointing fingers at specific countries and demanding reparations might not advance the conversation, one expert said. Its the advanced and industrialized world thats scared about this liability and compensation angle, Nisha Krishnan, the climate resilience lead at the World Resources Institute Africa, told CNN. Developing countries and small island nations cant do this by themselves; they need the world to move with them. Theyre very well aware that any sort of conversation about liability isnt helpful. The data could be used in court to show a link between one countrys emissions and anothers economic losses, but any such lawsuit would likely be very drawn out and complicated, said Michael Burger, the executive director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. In an event a country is able to clear the jurisdictional and legal hurdles of a transnational lawsuit, this would provide one potential methodology for allocating damage or allocating responsibility in collecting damages, Burger said. In actual litigation, the methodologies will be challenged, there will be competing views, there will be a battle of the experts, and every aspect of the study will be tested. Still, Burger said the Dartmouth study is quite compelling. I think it has the potential to attract a lot of attention, he said.",12/07/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/12/world/greenhouse-gas-climate-emissions-gdp-loss-us-china/index.html
This supercharged tree might help fight climate change,"The problem with trees is that they are too slow. Part of the issue with catastrophic climate change is that, by some measures, an incredible amount of damage is already done. Even if all the coal-fired power plants were magically turned into wind and solar overnight, and all our cars were electric, all the greenhouse gases that we pumped into our atmosphere for 200 years would still be there. Trees could, theoretically, help fix that. As they grow, they absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and, long story short, turn it into wood. But many trees only grow a foot or less per year. To not just halt climate change, but actually reverse it, someone would have to invent a tree that can grow much, much faster. Living Carbon, a San Francisco-based company, says its done exactly that. The startup says its genetically modified hybrid poplar trees to grow faster so theyll absorb more carbon dioxide and help minimize the damage of climate change. Carbon dioxide has grown rapidly in the atmosphere since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, leading to extreme climate effects. The startup says it edits the genes of the trees to speed up photosynthesis, the process that plants use to make food from carbon dioxide and water. This enables the trees to grow faster with the extra energy, according to the company. In one case, a tree it modified accumulated 53% more mass during five months of growth, according to a report Living Carbon published earlier this year. Living Carbon says this translates to about 27% more carbon being captured. The findings are a proof-of-concept, so they will need to be proven to hold up over the long term of a trees life, and at a scale large enough to have a significant impact on the climate. Living Carbon plans to plant about 4 million trees by 2023, and it has already done test plantings on abandoned mine lands. Living Carbon says if it doubles its existing acreage of planted trees every year, by 2030 it will have removed 604 million metric tons of carbon. Thats 1.66% of global emissions in a typical year, according to Living Carbon. The startup, which was founded in 2019 and has raised $15 million, plans to generate revenue from sapling sales and carbon credits it receives for its gene-edited trees. Living Carbons cofounders, Maddie Hall and Patrick Mellor, view gene-edited trees as a way not only capture carbon but also restore damaged land. Hall previously worked as an investor focused on climate change and biotechnology. She met Mellor at the Foresight Institute, a non-profit focused on technology, which he was involved with as he focused on climate stabilization. About 75% of land worldwide has been degraded due to human activity, Hall told CNN Business. How do we develop species that would be able to actually capture carbon on those pieces of land? You need biotechnology to do that. Brazil saw record Amazon deforestation in the first half of 2022. In the US, the Midwest has seen 150 years of deforestation that impacted forests built over 8,000 years since the Glaciers retreated. What took millennia to accumulate took less than two centuries to remove, the university scientists, who were funded by the National Science Foundation, wrote in a study this month. Another potential benefit of gene-edited trees is that their roots will grow faster, which could help to more quickly address soil erosion in deforested areas. Living Carbon is among the startups trying to leverage synthetic biology, in which humans program cells like they have long programmed computer chips and software to complete tasks. Living Carbon says it chose to work first with hybrid poplar trees because its genome was already sequenced and theyre grown in academic and research contexts. Hybrid poplars seemed to be a quicker way to demonstrate their idea could work. They say theyre also working with Loblolly pine trees. But using trees to capture carbon isnt a cure all. Eventually, trees die and their carbon is released as they decompose. Living Carbon says its focusing more than half of its research on slowing biomass decomposition to account for this, and its seedlings can also be harvested for durable wood products, which delays decomposition. Kent H. Redford, a conservationist and consultant who wrote a book, Strange Natures, about synthetic biology, told CNN Business that modifying trees has potential, but that much remains unknown. There are reasonable concerns, including whether genetically modified trees could become unwelcome, invasive species. Conservationists should engage technology creators to see if there are ways their ideas can work socially and economically, he said. He added that conservationists are failing at preserving biodiversity, so they must be open to considering new tools, while also avoiding hyperbole. Theyre here and theyll stay, Redford said of tools like synthetic biology. We must talk to the public without turning it into a litany of either this is the worlds best solution, or this is the worlds worst idea.",15/07/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/15/business/living-carbon-gene-edit-trees/index.html
A hypothetical weather forecast for 2050 is already coming true,"Two years ago, forecasters in the UK conducted an interesting thought experiment: What will our forecasts look like in 2050? The climate crisis is pushing weather to the extreme all over the world, and temperatures in the northern latitudes have been particularly sensitive to these changes. So meteorologists at the UK Met Office  the official weather forecast agency for the UK  dove in to the super long-range climate models in the summer of 2020 to see what kind of temperatures theyd be forecasting in about three decades. Not actual weather forecast, the Met Offices graphics said. Examples of plausible weather based on climate projections. Well, on Monday and Tuesday, the plausible becomes reality  28 years early. Simon Lee, an atmospheric scientist at Columbia University in New York, noted the striking similarity between the 2050 outlook and the forecast for early next week in the UK. Today, the forecast for Tuesday is shockingly almost identical for large parts of the country, Simon tweeted, adding in a later post that what is coming on Tuesday gives an insight into the future. In 30 years, this forecast will seem rather typical. Temperatures are forecast to run 10 to 15 degrees warmer than normal early next week in the UK. Highs could approach 40 degrees Celsius (around 104 degrees Fahrenheit) for the first time  a prediction that prompted meteorologists there to issue a red heat warning for the first time ever. To be clear, this would be truly record-breaking heat. The countrys hottest temperature ever measured was 38.7 degrees Celsius at the Cambridge Botanic Garden in 2019. Its also clearly a sign of how rapidly the climate crisis is altering our weather. We hoped we wouldnt get to this situation, the Met Offices climate attribution scientist Nikos Christidis said in a statement. Climate change has already influenced the likelihood of temperature extremes in the UK. The chances of seeing 40C days in the UK could be as much as 10 times more likely in the current climate than under a natural climate unaffected by human influence. The chance of exceeding 40 degrees is increasing rapidly, Christidis said. This is about more than a few uncomfortable days. Extreme heat is among the most deadly weather events  we just dont tend to see it happening in the moment, when heat stroke and death are attributed to underlying conditions like heart illness or respiratory disease. And recent reports would suggest no more than 5% of UK homes have air conditioning to help keep residents cool. We saw a shockingly similar situation play out in the United States just last summer, when the Pacific Northwest was plagued with extreme heat for days. Hundreds of people died in that heatwave. Officials in British Columbia noted that more than 800 excess deaths occurred during the heat  deaths that were unexpected and far from the norm for that time of year. Unlike flooding or wildfires destroying a town, the sense of urgency around a deadly heat wave is not so dramatic, said Kristie Ebi, a climate and health researcher at the University of Washington, underscoring that heat is a silent killer. When its hot outside, its just plain hot outside  and so its a relatively silent killer, Ebi previously told CNN. People are generally unaware and dont think about the risks associated with these high temperatures. She also said that its important to understand that the climate is not like what it was even just a few years ago. The climate crisis is already affecting our lives today, and it will continue to hit the most vulnerable. We all look forward to the summer as we enjoy the warmer temperatures, but there are people who are at risk at higher temperatures, she said. As the climate continues to change or higher temperatures get higher than what we experienced when we were younger, people need to pay more attention, particularly to those around you.",15/07/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/15/weather/2050-uk-forecast-comes-true-in-2022/index.html
Democrats fumble on the climate crisis again as US suffers consequences of inaction,"After more than a year of painstaking negotiations, congressional Democrats on Thursday night found themselves no further on implementing their ambitious climate agenda than when President Joe Biden took office. For the second time in seven months, Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia walked away from a deal to address the climate crisis, citing concerns over spending and inflation. Inflation is absolutely killing many, many people. They cant buy gasoline. They have a hard time buying groceries, Manchin told a West Virginia radio host on Friday. Everything they buy and consume for their daily lives is a hardship to them. Cant we wait to make sure we do nothing to add to that? It was deja vu for climate hawks who watched a similar climate bill fail during the Obama administration in 2010, after which then-President Barack Obama had to rely on executive action. Twelve years later, Democrats again fumbled the climate crisis within yards of scoring, just as climate scientists are becoming increasingly apoplectic about the urgency to act. The eight hottest years on record have all occurred since 2010, and weather disasters have cost the US more than $100 billion per year on average during that time  almost double what they averaged in the decade before. Biden walked into the Oval Office promising the boldest climate action of any president before him. But Manchin, heavily invested in the coal industry, has long been skeptical of clean energy. When running for Congress in 2010, Manchin cut a campaign ad of himself shooting Democrats climate cap-and-trade bill with a rifle. Manchin dealt the agenda its final blow this week, denying Democrats their chance to pass climate legislation for at least several years. He killed this, and he has to own that, John Podesta, Obamas climate adviser and founder of the Center for American Progress, told CNN. Now Biden and Democrats have to explain why  in a context where Democrats had at least nominal control of the White House, House and Senate  they couldnt get the job done, Podesta said. CNN spoke with 11 lawmakers, congressional staffers and outside climate advocates who said they place much of the blame squarely on Manchin, a figure several sources described as difficult to pin down, frequently finding new excuses to delay action. A spokesperson for Manchin declined to comment for this story. Even as Manchin insisted Friday he was still open to a deal on climate measures in September, sources inside and outside the Senate told CNN they were deeply skeptical after months of goalposts being moved. Its a bunch of bullsh*t, an exasperated senior Democratic aide told CNN, adding Manchin does not want to be held accountable. Others lamented that even as the administration seemed to focus on climate early in Bidens tenure, the congressional result was eerily like Obamas. When you have an ally in the White House, these issues become more painful when we give them away, House Natural Resources Chairman Raul Grijalva told CNN. Climate change was a priority, but inevitably when we get to this negotiation point, environmental issues, the climate crisis, frontline communities and indigenous issues get put back, they become part of the trade. This is a pattern that gets continued every time. Just days before Manchin torpedoed the climate measures, Democrats had been feeling confident they could strike a deal that would raise taxes on corporations and wealthier earners, lower prescription drug costs and tackle energy costs and the growing threat of climate change. As negotiations came to a head mid-week, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer made a number of deep concessions to try to woo Manchin, offering to significantly reshape the bill to fit Manchins wishlist, according to a Democratic source briefed on the negotiations  channeling the revenue to tax reform; striking electric vehicle tax credits; adding additional measures to encourage more oil and gas drilling. Schumer made concession after concession to at least get the best we could get, Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota told CNN. To have Sen. Manchin walk away from that good-faith negotiation was stunning to me. Manchins approach to the latest talks was reminiscent of failed negotiations on Build Back Better in December, as well as previous negotiations on Democrats earlier clean electricity standard that he eventually killed from earlier versions of the bill. Two sources involved in those earlier negotiations with Manchin said the West Virginia senator and his staff often proved impossible to pin down. Instead of saying what Manchin wanted out of a deal, Manchins team instead would often criticize what the other side was offering, the sources said. Its like a word salad of why they dont like it, one source said. They will never say what they want; they will attack what you have. [Manchin] so desperately doesnt want to appear to be on the hook  because he wants to walk away. Its just so slippery. A Democratic senator told CNN theres a throughline in failed negotiations  they are often on energy issues, and Manchin has made clear that investments in clean energy must be accompanied by more oil and gas drilling. I think it is particularly a problem on energy negotiations, the Democratic senator said, adding that Manchin chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Biden, who pledged to slash the countrys planet-warming emissions in half as part of rejoining the Paris Agreement, vowed on Friday to take action even without the support of Congress. If the Senate will not move to tackle the climate crisis and strengthen our domestic clean energy industry, I will take strong executive action to meet this moment, Biden said in a statement. Biden didnt provide specifics on the kinds of climate action he would take, but climate advocates told CNN the administration should issue a mix of strong rules to cut emissions from power plants, vehicles and the oil and gas industry. Advocates are expected to put even stronger pressure on the US Department of Interior to stop oil and gas leasing on federal lands, which has become a politically charged flash point among Republicans and Manchin. With Manchins vote no longer attainable, advocates told CNN now is the time to dial executive action and federal regulation up to 100. Theres no excuse now, Varshini Prakash, co-founder of the Sunrise Movement, told CNN. What I am looking for is a coordinated agency wide response at the executive level that is utilizing every tool and agency at their disposal to address the climate crisis. John Larsen, a climate expert and partner at the non-partisan think tank Rhodium Group, said that Biden still has time to distinguish himself from Obamas legacy on climate by continuing to ramp up on clean energy and ramping down on fossil fuels. When [the 2010 bill] fizzled out, there was no discussion or action on climate after that until after 2012 election, Larsen said. Should you repeat that part of the history again, well be five years out from 2030. More immediately, Podesta told CNN, the failure of climate legislation in Congress will hurt Biden and the United States at the next round of international climate talks this November in Egypt. I think it weakens the US, Podesta said. I think that [US Climate Envoy] John Kerrys done a terrific job, but ultimately you have to demonstrate that you can deliver on your commitments, and ones power comes from that.",16/07/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/16/politics/democrats-climate-failure-manchin/index.html
Why the US is so horribly incapable of meaningful climate action,"While the worlds climate is hot and getting hotter, the US government is frozen in time. Runways are melting in the UK. Lakes are drying up in the US. Fires are raging all over. But the federal government is stuck in amber, blocked by a Supreme Court that pines for a pre-industrial age, insisting on new laws for the Environmental Protection Agency to fight climate change, and beholden to a custom in the Senate that makes any new climate law all but impossible. One Democratic senator  Joe Manchin, from the coal-producing state of West Virginia  held the power to bless or destroy some climate action this year. He chose destruction. Europes second major heat wave of this summer is its worst so far. The UK could record its highest ever temperature if, as expected, it logs 40 degrees Celsius (about 104 Fahrenheit) on Tuesday. Wildfires are destroying areas in France and Spain. Brits more used to the cool and damp have lived without air conditioning, something they might need to rethink since this weeks heat wave is a preview of the worlds new climate. As CNN Senior Climate Editor Angela Fritz wrote last week, the weather the UK is experiencing now was actually part of a hypothetical climate change forecast prepared by the UK government. Its coming true decades earlier than predicted. I asked Fritz why Americans should be looking at the weather in Europe. She sent me these reasons why we should expect more hot than cold as the climate changes  and why our way of life is compounding the problem: The second part of this story has to do with the US government, which is witnessing a conservative Supreme Court wield more power to weaken the federal government. Less power for the EPA. In June the conservatives who will control the court for decades denuded the EPA of its ability to, as CNN wrote, broadly regulate carbon emissions from existing power plants. It also upended years of doctrine by which the federal government assumed authority to regulate everything from climate policy to worker safety. Congress is dysfunctional. Busting the federal bureaucracy back to the Gilded Age might sound good in a legal seminar, as in demanding more guidance from Congress. But the problem is that the growing tribalism of US politics means Congress cannot agree to do big things. Climate change, which scientists have long argued is ultimately an existential threat, is the biggest. But inflation. Manchin cited the immediate issue of inflation as his reason for abandoning the other immediate issue of people changing the worlds climate. Inflation is absolutely killing many, many people, Manchin told MetroNews Talkline. They cant buy gasoline, they have a hard time buying groceries, everything they buy and consume for their daily lives is a hardship to us. And cant we wait to make sure that we do nothing to add to that? Well have to wait. And if Republicans take control of the US House after Novembers election, short of a party epiphany, we will continue to wait. White House economic adviser Jared Bernstein told CNNs Dana Bash on State of the Union on Sunday that he didnt understand how Manchin could miss the devastating impacts of the climate crisis. It is beyond me how anyone could miss it, Bernstein said, arguing droughts, floods and wildfires, which have been made worse by the climate crisis, are costing the economy $100 billion each year. The plan Manchin abandoned, already drastically pared back to suit his fancy, included massive investments in clean and renewable energy and electric vehicles to cut down on fossil fuels and incentives to get Americans to become much more energy efficient. This problem is bigger than Joe Manchin. The West Virginia senator is an easy target for frustration since he is a Democrat bucking his party. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, accused Manchin Sunday of intentionally sabotaging President Joe Bidens agenda. But that lets Republicans off the hook for taking a united party position against any sort of climate action. Theres plenty of blame to go around, although that wont help. For now, while the climate crisis continues, the biggest plans to fight it are on ice.

Extreme heat is baking a country woefully unprepared for the climate crisis,"Heat waves across multiple continents have dashed records, threatened public health and buckled infrastructure, in what scientists say are signs of the climate crisis impact on day-to-day weather. Americans are used to switching on their air conditioners any time temperatures near 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 degrees Celsius). But in the UK, record-shredding heat this week has brought life to a pandemic-esque standstill. Temperatures in the UK breached 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) for the first time on Tuesday, making it the countrys hottest day on record. In the US, one-third of the population was under heat-related weather warnings on Tuesday and Wednesday, with temperatures expected to climb north of 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43 degrees Celsius) in the Plains states. Looking at the cause of these heat extremes in the US and Europe, there are different systems at play. In Europe, a strong ridge of high pressure has allowed temperatures to build over the continent for the past several days. On Tuesday, an area of low pressure was moving in off the coast, acting to help funnel the extreme heat northward into the UK. In the US, a strong dome of high pressure has set up over the Southern Plains and Mississippi Valley. Instead of heat being funneled in from the south, it is building unabated as the sun bakes down through cloudless skies. The connecting tissue between these heat waves is the influence of greenhouse gas emissions and the planets ever-warming baseline temperature. The UK Met Offices chief scientist, Stephen Belcher, was in a state of disbelief as he delivered a video statement about the shocking temperatures the country experienced Tuesday, noting they would have been virtually impossible the UK in an undisrupted climate. But climate change driven by greenhouse gases have made these temperatures possible, and were actually seeing that possibility now, he said, adding that if the world keeps emitting greenhouse gases at the level it is now, such heat waves are likely to occur there every three years. Forty degrees Celsius mat not be that hot to someone sitting in the Central US, Australia, the Middle East or in northern India. In the UK, it forced people to work from home and students to study remotely. Authorities told people not to take trains, which become dangerous on hot tracks that expand and bend in the heat. In other words, dont leave home. But in the UK, which is more likely to struggle with cold rather than hot, homes too are designed to keep heat in. Desk fans are selling out all over the country, but they only go so far. The weather has got Brits so hot and bothered, poor heat management has become the latest criticism hurled at the nations outgoing prime minister Boris Johnson  this week held up as another example of the disgraced leaders failures. The all-time temperature record for the UK has not just been broken, it has been absolutely obliterated, said Hannah Cloke, natural hazards researcher at the University of Reading. The mark of 39 degrees Celsius will never even exist as a UK temperature record, because we have just soared past it into the 40s in a single sweaty leap. The UK is woefully unprepared for the impacts of the climate crisis. It struggles to manage floods when they occur. In the heat, the nation buckles. So many fires ignited in London on Tuesday that the citys fire brigade declare a major incident and were stretched beyond their capacity. Four people have drowned as people flocked to beaches, rivers and lakes just to try to get cool. Even a runway at an airport on Londons outskirts had to be closed off as it melted in the heat. In southern Europe, a region more accustomed to extreme heat, at least 1,100 people have died in the latest heat wave, and French firefighters are overwhelmed with blazes tearing through forests. Twenty-one European nations are under heat-related warnings. Americans may be more used to the heat, but heat waves are getting longer and more frequent there too, which means more time indoors, or wherever the air conditioning may be. No fewer than 100 million Americans  almost a third of the nation  were under heat alerts on Tuesday. The alerts run from the southern Plains into the Mississippi and Tennessee River Valleys, and there are scattered alerts through the Southwest. The Northeast has already issued heat advisories for heat feeling like 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 Celsius) for Wednesday. The most dangerous heat is forecast around parts of Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas where excessive heat warnings are in place for Dallas, Oklahoma City, Tulsa and Little Rock. Temperatures there are expected to soar to 100 to 110 degrees Farhenheit (as high as 43 degrees Celsius) over the next few days. Scientists who work on just how much of a role the climate crisis is playing in extreme weather now say that just about every heat wave in the world is influenced by humans burning fossil fuels. Friederike Otto from the Grantham Institute for Climate Change at Imperial College London said that it was up to the world to reach net zero  where humans emit as little greenhouse gas as possible and offsets the rest  to stop heat waves from becoming even worse, deadly and disruptive. We have the agency to make us less vulnerable and redesign our cities, homes, schools and hospitals and educate us on how to keep safe, Otto told CNN. 40 degrees Celsius in the UK is not an act of god, but to a large degree due to our past and present burning of fossil fuels. In China, the annual sanfu  which is usually three lots of 10 days in July and August when temperatures and humidity peak  is now forecast to run for an extended period of 40 days, the state weather forecaster said, according to Reuters. It warned of scorching heat waves this week, despite seasonal rain, with temperatures likely climb as high as 42 degrees Celsius (107.6 Fahrenheit) in the south from Wednesday. In central London on Tuesday, a student named Asser who braved the heat told CNN that world wasnt doing enough to battle the heat waves. In fact, the world is doing nothing. The world is burning and we are doing nothing about it. We are just consuming, the industry is running and nobody is doing anything about the climate he said. Youve got heat waves in Europe and London and US, everywhere  you can see it, its obvious. Youve got floods and wildfires and everything.",19/07/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/19/world/heat-emergency-uk-us-climate/index.html
Australia? environment is ?oor and deteriorating?says damning new report,"As Europe sweltered in the summer heat, Australians took stock of a new report that revealed just how much the countrys environment has deteriorated in the last five years. Our waters are struggling and so is the land, said Labors new Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek, as she released the long-awaited State of the Environment report Tuesday. Though finished in 2021, the report wasnt released by the previous Coalition government. When you read it, youll know why, said Plibersek, who started the job six weeks ago, after the May election delivered a strong swing toward parties and independent candidates promising tougher action on climate change. The report found Australias environment is poor and deteriorating due to climate change, habitat loss, invasive species, pollution and resource extraction. The devastating effects of the climate crisis were woven throughout the report, from marine heat waves that have caused mass coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef to extreme weather events including bushfires to flooding. But despite the grim toll global temperature rises are having on Australias landscape, Plibersek said the new Labor government would not renege on its pre-election promise to allow new coal mines, if they won environmental approval and commercial support. Nor would the government be raising Australias targets of cutting emissions by 43% on 2005 levels by 2030, or achieving net zero emissions before its stated target of 2050. There are some people who would say we shouldnt have any mining anywhere. Its just not a sustainable or reasonable proposition for a modern economy like Australias to say that, she said. We made a promise on zero net emissions with an interim target of 43% carbon pollution reduction. We will keep that promise. The report noted that Australias emissions are likely to have peaked. But climate scientists say they are not declining fast enough to meet the Paris Agreement to limit the global average temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. According to researchers at Climate Analytics, Labors 43% target is consistent with 2 degrees Celsius of global warming. The report found that Australia has lost more mammal species than any other country in the 38 member Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (a grouping that includes the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand); that there are now more foreign species than native ones; and the country has experienced a plague of marine plastics, Plibersek said in a speech to the National Press Club following the reports release. In the countrys northern waters, lost or abandoned fishing nets are strangling up to 14,000 turtles a year, and down the eastern coast, warming seas have killed kelp beds, threatening reef habitats and abalone and lobster stocks, she added. On land, more than 77,000 square kilometers (30,000 square miles) of habitat belonging to threatened species have been cleared in the past two decades  an area roughly the size of Tasmania or Ireland. Much of this clearing occurred in small increments, Plibersek said. In fact, more than 90% of it was never assessed under our environmental laws. The clearing has impacted Australias koalas, which are now endangered in three states and territories. Since the last State of the Environment report was released in 2016, theres been an 8% increase in species listed as threatened under the countrys Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC). The most recent report said the number of endangered species could be even higher due to inadequacies in the risk assessment process, and so too could the number of extinctions. Most mammal extinctions in Australia have been driven by predation from introduced species, especially the feral cat and European red fox, it added. The Labor government laid the blame for Australias environmental degradation squarely at the feet of the Liberal-National coalition, who were in power from 2013 until losing the May election. The previous governments funding cuts held back business, they damaged the economy, and they undermined practical efforts to protect our environment, Plibersek said during a televised press conference. She added that so little effort had gone into achieving some targets that they would be almost impossible to reach. Opposition environment minister Jonno Duniam, from the Liberal Party, accused Plibersek of using the report as a prop for attacks on the previous government, pointing out that the Morrison administration spent billions of dollars on green initiatives. We focused on the job, without wasting the majority of our energy on misguided attacks on our political opponents, Duniam said in a statement, less than two months after a bitter election campaign that saw both parties attack the other on policies covering everything from the environment to relations with China. Plibersek announced a number of new targets on Tuesday, but deferred others  including a once-in-a-generation reform of Australias environment and biodiversity laws (the EPBC)  until she had time to consult more widely. The Labor government also plans to expand the countrys national estate by setting a goal of protecting 30% of Australias land and 30% of its oceans by 2030, and exploring the creation of new national parks and marine protected areas, Plibersek said. That includes pursuing the East Antarctic Marine Park, a proposal backed by Australia, France and the European Union to protect a vast tranche of the Ross Sea. New proposals also include greater protection for Indigenous sites to avoid the destruction seen in 2020 when mining giant Rio Tinto destroyed the sacred Juukan Gorge caves in Western Australia to expand its iron ore mine. We are so lucky to be so rich in First Nations cultural heritage, of course we need to have better systems for protecting it that dont lead to appalling, shameful outcomes, like Juukan Gorge, Plibersek said. The report also highlighted the need to give Australias First Nations people more control over the protection and rehabilitation of the land. To that end, the government has also promised to double the number of Indigenous rangers to 3,800 by the end of the decade. Nicki Hutley, an economist with the Climate Council, said changes to Australias environment laws must oblige the government to consider the impacts of climate change when considering applications for new coal and gas projects. Earlier this year, the previous government won an appeal against a court ruling that would have compelled the federal environment minister to consider the impact on children of new coal projects. Kelly OShanassy, Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Conservation Foundation, said independent oversight was also needed to ensure government targets are met. To halt Australias nature crisis we need strong national environment laws, an independent regulator to enforce them and adequate funding for the recovery of Australias threatened species and the restoration of degraded landscapes.",19/07/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/19/australia/australia-climate-change-environment-report-intl-hnk/index.html
The climate crisis is driving heat waves and wildfires. Here? how,"Brutal heat waves are gripping both Europe and the United States this week and are forecast to dump searing temperatures on much of China into late August. In addition to temperatures spiking above 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit), wildfires are raging across southern Europe with evacuations in towns in Italy and Greece. The searing heat is part of a global pattern of rising temperatures, attributed by scientists to human activity. Climate change makes heat waves hotter and more frequent. This is the case for most land regions, and has been confirmed by the UNs global panel of climate scientists (IPCC). Greenhouse gas emissions from human activities have heated the planet by about 1.2 Celsius since pre-industrial times. That warmer baseline means higher temperatures can be reached during extreme heat events. Every heatwave that what we are experiencing today has been made hotter and more frequent because of climate change, said Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College London, who also co-leads the World Weather Attribution research collaboration. But other conditions affect heatwaves too. In Europe, atmospheric circulation is an important factor. A study in the journal Nature this month found that heatwaves in Europe have increased three-to-four times faster than in other northern mid-latitudes such as the United States. The authors linked this to changes in the jet stream  a fast west-to-east air current in the northern hemisphere. To find out exactly how much climate change affected a specific heat wave, scientists conduct attribution studies. Since 2004, more than 400 such studies have been done for extreme weather events, including heat, floods and drought  calculating how much of a role climate change played in each. This involves simulating the modern climate hundreds of times and comparing it to simulations of a climate without human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. For example, scientists with World Weather Attribution determined that a record-breaking heat wave in western Europe in June 2019 was 100 times more likely to occur now in France and the Netherlands than if humans had not changed the climate. Global warming is already driving extreme heat events. On average on land, heat extremes that would have happened once every 10 years without human influence on the climate are now three times more frequent, said ETH Zurich climate scientist Sonia Seneviratne. Temperatures will only cease rising if humans stop adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Until then, heatwaves are set to worsen. A failure to tackle climate change would see heat extremes escalate even more dangerously. Countries agreed under the global 2015 Paris Agreement to cut emissions fast enough to limit global warming to 2C, and aim for 1.5C, to avoid its most dangerous impacts. Current policies would not cut emissions fast enough to meet either goal. A heat wave that occurred once per decade in the pre-industrial era would happen 4.1 times a decade at 1.5C of warming, and 5.6 times at 2C, the IPCC says. Letting warming pass 1.5C means that most years will be affected by hot extremes in the future, Seneviratne said. Climate change increases hot and dry conditions that help fires spread faster, burn longer and rage more intensely. In the Mediterranean, that has contributed to the fire season starting earlier and burning more land. Last year, more than half a million hectares burned in the European Union, making it the blocs second-worst forest fire season on record after 2017. Hotter weather also saps moisture from vegetation, turning it into dry fuel that helps fires to spread. The hotter, drier conditions right now, it just makes [fires] far more dangerous, Copernicus senior scientist Mark Parrington said. Countries such as Portugal and Greece experience fires most summers, and have infrastructure to try to manage them  though both have received emergency EU help this summer. But hotter temperatures are also pushing wildfires into regions not used to them, and thus less prepared to cope. Forest management and ignition sources are also important factors. In Europe, more than nine out of 10 fires are ignited by human activities, like arson, disposable barbeques, electricity lines, or littered glass, according to EU data. But the climate crisis typically creates conditions that make the impacts of these fires much worse. Countries, including Spain, face the challenge of shrinking populations in rural areas, as people move to cities, leaving smaller workforces to clear vegetation and avoid fuel for forest fires building up. Some actions can help to limit severe blazes, such as setting controlled fires that mimic the low-intensity fires in natural ecosystem cycles, or introducing gaps within forests to stop blazes rapidly spreading over large areas. But scientists concur that without steep cuts to the greenhouse gases causing climate change, heat waves, wildfires, flooding and drought will significantly worsen. When we look back on the current fire season in one or two decades time, it will probably seem mild by comparison, said Victor Resco de Dios, professor of forest engineering at Spains Lleida University.",21/07/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/21/world/climate-heat-wave-wildfires-weather-explainer-intl/index.html
War and energy woes push the climate crisis to the back seat in an endless vicious cycle,"As Russia resumed its supply of natural gas to Germany after weeks of what it called maintenance on its Nord Stream 1 pipeline, leaders in Berlin breathed a sigh of relief. A day earlier, US President Joe Biden chose to defer declaring a climate emergency, which could have unleashed a wave of resources to fight the crisis, despite his opponents torpedoing his plans. At the same time, Europe more widely is devouring enormous amounts of liquefied natural gas  a harmful fossil fuel  imported from the US and other allies to temper its reliance on Russian energy. Europe is also returning to coal, the most carbon-heavy of fossil fuels. All this while the northern hemisphere swelters through a summer of extreme heat. More than 100 million Americans are under heat alerts as a heat wave spread further and further afield. They are forced to stay home or seek air-conditioned venues until the heat passes. Germany has had its hottest day of the year. Greece is literally putting out fires around its capital. Yet Germany and Netherlands are upping their coal use. Greeces state energy company said last week it would delay its coal exit by another one to two years. Even Austria, which stopped using coal for power in 2020, is preparing to reopen a mothballed plant in case of a winter emergency. Countries committed to fighting climate change are being cornered into pushing the issue to the back seat as Russias war exacerbates a global energy crunch and a cost of living crisis. And ironically, the climate crisis is worsening energy shortages in a vicious cycle. Extreme heat is causing some power plants to buckle, forcing blackouts, even in homes that rely on air conditioning to keep temperatures tolerable. Just about everyone in the northern hemisphere is talking about air conditioners. Those who have them are cranking them up. Many who dont are thinking about buying them. That requires more energy, usually from burning fossil fuels, and so the cycle goes on. But there is reality to what energy sources are available here and now. Slow action on the green transition in the past means there simply arent enough renewables for a quick fix. Were going to have to swallow some uncomfortable options in the short term to get through this winter, said Tara Connolly, a senior gas campaigner with the NGO Global Witness. In Europe, where scorching temperatures broke records in the UK and left hundreds of millions sweltering on the continent, this weeks heat wave has exposed deficiencies in how prepared some countries are for extreme weather. The current heatwave should be driving more action, said Lisa Fischer, program leader at London-based environmental think tank E3G. It affects productivity, it affects the functions of the economy ... that feedback loop hasnt been understood in the past. The effects of the climate crisis are visible almost wherever we look: Several days of unusually warm weather in northern Greenland have triggered rapid melting there, and globally, hot-temperature records are outpacing cool records by 10 to 1, according to data from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. But Russias war and the global energy crisis that followed has nonetheless forced a paradoxical approach from European leaders in recent weeks: While governments are returning to dirtier fuels to get through their immediate energy woes, theyre also rushing for renewable energy sources to reduce their reliance on Russian gas and mitigate the climate crisis. To reduce its reliance on Russian gas, the European Union on Wednesday unveiled an emergency rationing plan. The Save Gas for a Safe Winter plan announced sets a target for the 27 member states to reduce their gas demand by 15% between August and March next year. That reduction is based on countries average gas consumption during the same months over the previous five years. Among the proposed measures, the EU Commission is encouraging industry to switch to alternate energy sources  including coal where necessary  and to introduce auction systems that compensate companies for reducing their gas consumption. Were seeing an acceleration on clean energy ... what has previously been seen as climate action has become part of the energy security conversation, Fischer said. (And) its remarkable that the European Green Deal hasnt been dropped or abandoned amid this turbulent period, she added. Connolly said it was an absolute shame that it took Russias invasion of Ukraine, more intense climate crisis impacts and an energy poverty crisis all at the same time to get Europe to speed up its green transition. The one silver lining is that the energy transition in Europe will accelerate as a result of this, she said. Yet the return to fossil fuels is worrying. Governments insist they are temporary, but they can be hard to trust. Earlier this month, EU lawmakers approved a measure to label natural gas a green or sustainable source of energy, sending a signal to investors to pour more money into the fossil fuel. Connolly called the vote damaging in terms of the reputation of Europe, and to Europes attempts to phase out gas. And as Europe imports more and more liquefied natural gas (LNG) from places like the US, it becomes more and more addicted to it as an energy source. The continent is importing so much of the energy source, it is having to build new floating terminals just to receive it. It may wean itself of Russian gas for good reasons, but its not weaning itself of gas in general for the sake of tackling climate change. All this comes against a backdrop of ramped-up coal production in China  which produced more coal than ever last year as its power stations struggled to meet demand for electricity, undermining plans to curb carbon emissions. There too, 900 million people are living through a punishing heat wave that is expected to go on for weeks to come. Connolly said that a temporary return to coal in this energy crisis was understandable. But what is the longer term? she asked. Climate groups are urging European governments to prioritize sustainable investments now in order to establish a cleaner blueprint for the continent that does not rely on Russia. By the winter after next well have had three years to make big strides on developing our energy saving technologies  insulating buildings and homes  and building out renewables as quickly as we can, she said. As temperatures soared in the United States this week, President Biden spoke to the country Wednesday about the urgency of the climate crisis and renewed a discussion there around declaring a so-called climate emergency. Biden previewed actions his office could take to tackle the climate crisis and announced billions of dollars in funding for communities facing extreme heat. But the US President said he was running the traps on the totality of his authority to issue a national emergency that would unlock new federal resources and allow him to limit federal oil drilling. The pace of Bidens response left climate experts and advocates underwhelmed. He took useful but small-bore climate actions on Wednesday, climate activist Bill McKibben wrote on Twitter. The bigger test: will he declare a full-on climate emergency ... The next weeks will be crucial. And much of the world is watching Bidens moves with interest. The US is the worlds biggest carbon emitter and bears the biggest historical responsibility for the climate crisis. Though Biden pledged to cut US emissions in half by 2030, his climate agenda was torpedoed last week by a senator from his own party, Joe Manchin  a coal-state representative who has resisted the Presidents climate goals. We need the US to step up, not only purely for the climates stake but because climate cooperation is one of the few areas of multilateral cooperation that is still working, and working well, Fischer said. Its one of the few areas that we have China and others around the table and working with others, and thats incredibly important.",21/07/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/21/world/europe-us-climate-energy-heat-wave-intl-cmd/index.html
Pakistan? largest city battered by torrential rain as climate crisis makes weather more unpredictable,"Public services in Pakistans largest city, Karachi, have been suspended and businesses are being urged to close, as torrential rains cause deadly flash flooding and infrastructure damage, leaving at least 15 dead since Saturday. On Sunday night, more than 60 millimeters (2.3 inches) of rain fell in Karachi, equivalent to an entire months worth of rainfall in just a matter of hours. For several months every summer, Pakistan struggles to contend with heavy monsoon rains, but in recent years experts say climate change is accelerating existing weather patterns. On Sunday, Pakistans climate change minister, Sherry Rehman, issued flash flood warnings for residents in more than 14 cities and townships. Since the monsoon season began last month, more than 300 people have been killed by heavy rains across Pakistan, according to its National Disaster Management Authority. In Karachi, capital of Sindh province and home to almost 16 million, entire neighborhoods have been partially submerged. Photos show people wading knee-deep in muddy floodwater, with vehicles left stranded by the deluge. Infrastructure including bridges, highways and roads have been damaged, disrupting traffic and upending the lives of millions across the city. Many have stocked up on fuel for their generators in case of power outages. Climate change is a threat. We are a coastal city. Its happening so fast and we will bear the brunt, said Afia Salam, a climate change advocate in Karachi. People need to see the situation beyond individual events like a bridge falling or a road getting flooded. Pakistan often experiences heavy rains from July through September, but experts say the rains have only increased in both frequency and intensity. The rapidity of these events is increasing and our response is not keeping pace, said Salam. We are being reactive to individual events. Strategies need to be put in place. And the poorest and most vulnerable are on the front line of crisis. Karachi, the countrys financial capital, boasts luxury hotels, malls and upmarket gated communities. But disparities in wealth and development remain, and an estimated 50% of its residents are forced to live in informal settlements, according to the World Bank. Karachis infrastructure is highly vulnerable to climate-related disasters, according to the World Bank. The crisis is exacerbated by poor flood management and ineffective disaster response, experts say. Other provinces, including Balochistan in the southwest, have also experienced extreme rainfall in recent days. At least 87 people have been killed in the province due to heavy rainfall, floods and infrastructure collapse this month alone, according to a report from the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA). Two people  a woman and a child  died on Sunday after a roof collapsed in the provinces Jaffarabad district, according to Naseer Nasar, PDMA director general. At least eight dams in Balochistan have been breached, while nine bridges have been damaged, the PDMA report said. More than 700 livestock have died due to flooding, it added. Earlier this month, torrential rain caused widespread flooding in Karachi. Most underpasses were flooded, and there was nowhere to pump the water out to, according to the chief minister of Sindh, Murad Ali Shah. Karachis main streets, which house financial institutions and bank headquarters including Pakistans central bank, were flooded and rescue services were using boats to reach stranded people. Extreme weather events in South Asia are becoming increasingly frequent due to climate change, with temperatures in parts of India and Pakistan reaching record levels during a heat wave in April and May. A deadly cholera outbreak linked to contaminated drinking water had infected thousands of people in central Pakistan in May, as the country grappled with a water crisis exacerbated by the scorching temperatures. Residents in Pir Koh, a remote mountainous town in Balochistan province, had no access to clean drinking water. The lack of rain had caused nearby ponds to dry up, with their only source of water being a pipeline that had rusted and contaminated the water supply, said local resident Hassan Bugti. A 2022 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said they had medium confidence that heat waves and humidity stress would become more intense and frequent, and annual and summer monsoon precipitation will increase. India and Pakistan are among the countries expected to be worst affected by the climate crisis, according to the IPCC.",25/07/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/25/asia/pakistan-karachi-torrential-rain-climate-crisis-intl-hnk/index.html
Many Americans still don? think climate change is coming for them,"While parts of his state have been ravaged by deluge this summer, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky is pretty sure most Americans dont really care about the climate crisis. McConnell has been rightly pushing for federal disaster relief to get Kentuckians back on their feet after the freak floods. He did the same late last year when freak tornadoes swept through the state. That kind of spending is OK. But when he led Republican opposition to the massive bill Democrats hope will get the country off of carbon-emitting energy sooner, McConnell said people are concerned with other things. The American people are clear about their priorities. Environmental regulation is a 3% issue, McConnell said in a statement on Sunday following the Senates passage of the bill. Americans want solutions for inflation, crime, and the border, he added, suggesting Democrats shouldnt be spending on the climate crisis. Neither of Kentuckys Republican senators voted for the climate bill. The states Democratic governor, Andy Beshear, rarely mentions climate change and, as Inside Climate News has pointed out, he does not list climate change as a driving force behind his environmental policy. Democrats like Beshear and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin who can succeed in coal states arent going to advertise the climate crisis. I wish I could tell you why we keep getting hit here in Kentucky, Beshear said of the flooding and to the consternation of climate activists who know exactly why Kentucky keeps getting hit. I wish I could tell you why areas where people may not have much continue to get hit and lose everything. I cant give you the why, but I know what we do in response to it. And the answer is everything we can. These are our people. Lets make sure we help them out. In the wake of tragic flooding might not be the time to caterwaul about the climate crisis, but as the rate of natural disasters increases, as scientists say it will, the dots will have to be connected for more Americans. A majority of Americans acknowledge that climate change is real and that humans contribute to it. But a lot of people in eastern Kentucky might not know theyre feeling the effects of the climate crisis. About half the country in 2021  47%  believed global warming would harm them personally, according to data gathered by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. It used a statistical model to apply the results on a state-by-state basis and estimated that Kentucky residents were less likely than the American public as a whole to believe that humans are mostly to blame for climate change or that climate change would harm them personally. When the climate bill was in doubt last year, CNNs Rene Marsh visited parts of West Virginia that suffered disastrous flooding in 2016. Im not buying into the whole climate change thing, Jimmy Rader, a retired Iraq war veteran in Elkview, West Virginia, told Marsh. He was still rebuilding his house years after it was taken out by the flooding. Watch that report here. And read Marshs great story this week about how melting ice in Greenland could create an opportunity to mine nickel and cobalt needed to power electric vehicles. The climate crisis might be the existential threat driving an increase in weird weather and national disasters, but its not likely to drive the majority of people out to vote in November. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS in June and July, only about a third of registered voters said that climate change would be extremely important to their vote for Congress this year. That includes about half of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters and just 13% of Republicans and Republican-leaning voters. To McConnells point about Americans concerns, the economy and inflation were the top-cited issues. Democrats decided to market their climate and health care bill as the Inflation Reduction Act, even though it probably will have little or no short-term effect on inflation. That doesnt mean Democrats cant claim to have done the world a solid by uniting to spend billions to more quickly cut down on carbon emissions. But as long as they cant effectively tie the need for the spending to the natural disasters, it wont do much for them politically. Framed as economic opportunity, the move to renewable energy is finding an audience in red states, as CNNs Ella Nilsen wrote in April, when she looked at the booming wind industry in places such as Oklahoma. That industry will certainly benefit from the nearly $370 billion in climate spending over 10 years that Democrats are on track to deliver when the House votes on the sweeping bill later this week. Lets be clear: If we tackle our emissions, the root cause of what is driving global warming and a changing climate, then we will stabilize temperatures and we will keep the worst effects of climate change from impacting our communities and our people, said Ali Zaidi, the Biden administrations deputy national climate adviser, who appeared on CNN on Monday to talk about the climate bill but was also asked about the Kentucky flooding. CNNs Brandon Tensley wrote for his Race Deconstructed newsletter that climate change is hitting some communities harder than others. He talked to Deke Arndt, the chief of climate science and services at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations National Centers for Environmental Information. Key lines: The reality is that when creeks get up and out of their banks, they almost always find the folks who are already living closer to the margins, whether these are people in manufactured housing or mobile homes or people in homes that are well within the floodplain, Arndt told CNN. We saw it in eastern Kentucky last week. We saw it in my home region of western North Carolina last summer. Its an unrelenting theme, experts say: Flash floods, in particular, punch hard on already vulnerable communities. To help protect against climate-related hazards, we must think about disaster mitigation not as a short-term goal  but rather as a long-term one.",08/08/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/08/politics/climate-change-us-floods-what-matters/index.html
One-third of the food we eat is at risk because the climate crisis is endangering butterflies and bees,"Bee populations are declining. More than half of the bat species in the United States are in severe decline or listed as endangered. And international scientists recently announced the monarch butterfly is perilously close to extinction. What these three creatures have in common is that they are all pollinators. Without them, fruits, vegetables and other plants wouldnt be pollinated, and thats a major problem for our food supply. One out of every three bites of food that we eat is directly connected to a pollinator, Ron Magill, the communications director and a wildlife expert at Zoo Miami, told CNN. Around 30% of the food that ends up on our tables gets there because of things like butterflies, bees and bats. Losing those critical populations could also mean losing some of our favorite foods. Apples, melons, cranberries, pumpkins, squash, broccoli and almonds are among the foods most susceptible to the pollinator decline, according to the Food and Drug Administration. Bees, in particular, are responsible for pollinating around 90 commercially produced crops, the agency reports. Even tequila is at risk. Its all so intricately connected, whether youre eating the food that is directly pollinated or youre eating something that depends on that pollinator, Magill said. Its a domino effect. In other words, if you are eating fried chicken or pork chops, those chickens and pigs eat fruit, vegetables and other plants that depend on pollinators. And the climate crisis has taken a toll on pollinators. While more intense and prolonged drought is the most obvious impact, a growing concern is the effect of extreme heat  particularly on butterflies. Because butterflies are some of the most sensitive insects to changes in temperature, they are considered the canary in the coal mine when it comes to climate change, Magill said. Warmer temperatures cause plants to bloom sooner, which is out of sync with when the butterflies lay their eggs and metamorphose. This will mean the flowers they depend on for food will have already bloomed out, leaving little for the butterflies to feed on, which will in turn greatly impact their ability to reproduce and survive. It snowballs into a cyclical problem where the butterflies cant get the food they need to reproduce, nor can the plants get pollinated  causing both to suffer greatly. Also, for butterflies like monarchs that are known for long migrations from the Northern US to Mexico  food along their route may no longer be available at the time that the natural migration takes place. A UN report in 2019 found that a million species are at risk of extinction in the coming decades, as the climate crisis accelerates. Magill says were starting to see that play out in insect populations. One million species in the next 50 years, Magill said. That is catastrophic. Scientists at the the International Union for Conservation of Nature last month added the monarch butterfly  one of the worlds most popular and recognizable insects  to its red list of endangered species, noting that the destruction of its habitat and rising temperatures fueled by the climate crisis are increasingly threatening the species. Climate change has significantly impacted the migratory monarch butterfly and is a fast-growing threat; drought limits the growth of milkweed and increases the frequency of catastrophic wildfires, temperature extremes trigger earlier migrations before milkweed is available, while severe weather has killed millions of butterflies, scientists reported. Honeybees began to show an alarming decline in 2006. From April 2020 to April 2021, beekeepers in the US lost around 45% of their colonies, according to Auburn Universitys College of Agriculture, which reports that the average acceptable turnover is around 20%. Climate change may be amplifying a deadly parasite in honeybee populations. Research has showed that those bee-killing parasites become more prevalent in warmer climates which means as temperatures continue to rise the parasites could flourish and become catastrophic for bees. Several countries and even some states in the US are already moving to help protect these crucial species. California is pushing to restrict bee-killing pesticides. Magill noted that while these declines are happening gradually, they will eventually be too great for ecosystems to overcome  like a tipping point beyond which some species will be lost forever. You know, what is the straw that is going to break the camels back when it comes to the balance of the environment? Magill said. Bats also play an irreplaceable role in food security. The USDA points to recent studies which estimate that bats eat enough pests to save more than $1 billion per year in crop damage and pesticide costs in the United States, mostly from the corn industry alone. Across all agricultural production, consumption of insect pests by bats results in a savings of more than $3 billion per year, according to the US Fish and Wildlife Service. Bats are also vital pollinators. You wouldnt have tequila if you had no bats, because thats the only thing that pollinates the agave plant that makes tequila, Magill said. Bats are affected by the climate crisis in the same way butterflies and bees are. Bats are also more susceptible to heat stress, Magill said. There have been major die-offs of bats as a result of rising temperatures that led to death from heat stroke as bats have limited cooling mechanisms. Unlike butterflies and bees, though, bats arent just a vital pollinator  they are considered a major seed disperser and critical for our ecosystems, much like birds. The seeds from the fruits that they eat germinate after going through their digestive system and then are deposited throughout their range to plant future trees, Magill said. This is a global problem which means fixes need to be on a global scale, but there are still ways individual people can help. Plant gardens with native wildlife, the native plants that are critical to the survival of these animals, Magill said. Plants that are native will also require less care. If you plant a cactus in Louisiana, its not going to do well in the humid environment. Likewise, impatiens or begonias will not do well in the desert Southwest as they require a tremendous amount of water to flourish. A new online database helps users in the UK find pollinator friendly plants for their gardens, and support biodiversity. Similar lists of native, pro-pollinator plants exist for the United States. When you plant native wildflowers, youre planting a buffet for the wildlife that needs that to survive, Magill says. Thats the refueling stations for our pollinators. Magill points to Lady Bird Johnsons effort to beautify roadsides in the US. While her goal was nationwide, her efforts shone in Texas. She did such a wonderful thing with wildflowers in Texas, Magill says. There are times you can drive through Texas, and you can see wildflowers for as far as the eyes can see, and its such a beautiful sight, because she understood the value of that. While other states are doing that along roadways as well, individual homeowners can also do the same. We have beautiful plant life in our native areas where we live in this country. If we could focus more on that and start rebuilding what was naturally here, we can start bringing back those natural rhythms. You can also work to reduce your pesticide and chemical use around your home. Good alternatives include using organic products such as compost for soil health and adding beneficial insects like ladybugs, praying mantises, or even nematodes to keep pests away.",14/08/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/14/weather/food-risk-bee-butterfly-pollinator-decline-climate-scn/index.html
More water cuts as the US adjusts to the climate crisis,"The fear-inducing climate change stories are coming with more frequency and intensity, and the predictions about what will happen are dire. Here are three CNN stories published in just the last few days: The government is also, for the first time, trying to do something major about climate change. President Joe Biden on Tuesday signed into law Democrats plan to spend hundreds of billions to transition the country more quickly away from fossil fuels and move the US toward carbon neutrality. See whats in the package. But the big lesson from this summer should be that we dont have to wait for the effects of climate change. Theyre happening now with floods, wildfires and the drying out of the Western US. The Colorado River supplies water to 40 million people in the West. And on Tuesday, the federal government announced fresh cuts. Starting in January, the river will operate in whats known as a Tier 2 shortage condition for the first time, since Lake Meads water level is projected to be below 1,050 feet above sea level at that point. That means two states  Arizona and Nevada  as well as Mexico will face deeper cuts in how much water they can use from the Colorado River. California, however, will so far avoid cuts to water it receives from the Colorado River. Lake Mead has been around 1,040 feet this summer, just 27% of its capacity. Read the full report from CNNs Ella Nilsen and Rachel Ramirez. The Western water situation could ultimately affect all Americans since those states and the water they need fuel a multibillion dollar agriculture industry that feeds the country with access to green vegetables in the winter months, among other things. On a hill in Boulder City, Nevada, overlooking whats left of Lake Mead, CNNs chief climate correspondent Bill Weir talked about the coming water cuts. He pointed Tuesday to a so-called bathtub ring that shows where the lake used to reach. He showed a marina, moved a quarter mile from its former spot to follow the receding water line. The lake has fallen from 95% full to a little more than a quarter full, he told CNNs Alex Marquardt, illustrating the effects of two decades of nearly uninterrupted drought. Lower basin areas  those to the South and West  such as Nevada, Arizona and the country of Mexico will have to cut the most under the Tier 2 designation. Seven states agreed to share water as part of the Colorado River Compact signed 100 years ago: Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming. It was written after one of the wettest years ever, so all this water was over-allocated to the lower basin states, Weir said. As a result, there has been this tension with Colorado, Wyoming, Utah  the upper basin states where all that snowpack has been diminishing. That was the water table for the Western United States, and now its gone. The agreement has been updated periodically, most recently in 2019. But negotiations for more drastic cuts in the face of accelerating climate-change-driven-drought have not progressed. The federal government said Tuesday it will work with the rivers stakeholders to come up with a plan. Nilsen and Ramirez laid out some stats. In Nevada, non-functional turf is banned and people are being paid to remove lawns to help reduce water usage. Weir said that movement will have to make its way to Southern California, where residents have been asked to cut back but not stop watering lawns. Californias Gov. Gavin Newsom last week announced a new water strategy that includes capturing and storing rainwater as well as desalinating ocean water. CNNs Rene Marsh has previously reported about how communities in Arizona are being pitted against each other by the cuts, and investment firms are trading in water rights. But there are complaints that agricultural producers are not being asked to sacrifice as much. You have to have a contribution from the sector that uses 80% of the water, John Entsminger, the general manager for the Southern Nevada Water Authority, told Nilsen and Ramirez. Thats not law, politics, its just math, he said. What to do with agribusiness is a key part of the interstate talks, according to reports, with proposals to pay farmers to let lands lie fallow. As water is cut, it could impact the fertile valleys that provide the country with tomatoes and greens. Last year, CNN published a must-see interactive on how the water crisis will affect the countrys supply of vegetables. Theres a ton of ideas, even some wild ones, Weir said Tuesday. People say you should pipe water from the Mississippi or drag glaciers down from Alaska and melt them and use the water. Theyve been having these conversations for 100 years down here, but ultimately this is a slow-motion, man-made disaster in real time, he said, pointing to the skeletal lake behind him.",16/08/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/16/politics/water-cuts-drought-climate-change-what-matters/index.html
Pakistan emits less than 1% of the world? planet-warming gases. It? now drowning,"Pakistan was already struggling when the devastating monsoon rains hit. This year, economic and political crises have converged in the South Asian nation of more than 230 million, as food and fuel prices soared and former leader Imran Khan was forced from office. Now its reeling with the worst floods in living memory. Swaths of Pakistan are now underwater after experiencing the heaviest rains on record with little reprieve since mid-June. Some areas have seen five times their normal levels of monsoonal rain. More than 1,100 people have died and 33 million people are impacted  thats more than the population of Texas. Torrents of water have smashed through entire villages and farmland, razing buildings and wiping out crops. Satellite images from Maxar Technologies shared with CNN show how communities have been wiped out, leaving behind little more than bare Earth and dust. Pakistan is responsible for less than 1% of the worlds planet-warming gases, European Union data shows, yet it is the eighth most vulnerable nation to the climate crisis, according to the Global Climate Risk Index. Its paying a hefty price, not only with lives but destroyed schools, homes and bridges. Officials estimate the total bill will be $10 billion. The recovery could take years, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in Pakistan has said. And chances are any recovery will be interrupted by yet another disaster. We consistently see climate devastation in the forms of floods, monsoons, extensive droughts, extreme heat waves, Pakistans Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said in an interview with CNNs Eleni Giokos on Tuesday. And frankly, the people of Pakistan, the citizens of Pakistan, are paying the price in their lives, their livelihoods for the industrialization of rich countries that has resulted in this climate change. The stark inequity of the climate crisis, which is bearing down hardest on nations that have historically had the least to do with causing it, is raising questions over who should pay for it, particularly for the damage that countries like Pakistan are coming to terms with. The United Nations issued an appeal for $160 million in emergency funds on Tuesday, barely enough to scratch the surface of the $10 billion needed. Countries from the United States to Turkey are pitching in with aid, rescue helicopters, food and medical supplies. Yet the need is greater than what the world is giving. These devastating scenes and eye-watering recovery costs are what the climate crisis looks like at 1.2 degrees Celsius of global warming since industrialization. But the world is on track for warming of more than 2 degrees Celsius, analyses show, and scientists warn every fraction of a degree of warming will worsen the impacts of the crisis. Fahad Saeed, a climate scientist with the group Climate Analytics, who is based in Islamabad, told CNN that Pakistan was in a Catch-22 situation. The country needs money to adapt to the crisis, yet because it has to pay for the damage that extreme weather is already causing it will struggle to find the funds it needs to adjust. What is happening right now at 1.2 degrees centigrade of warming is not because of the poor people in Pakistan, he said. They are not responsible for it, and this brings out the issue of climate justice in a very clear form. He added that Pakistan, like so many developing nations, needed to bring more people out of poverty, a difficult thing to do in the midst of back-to-back extreme weather events with such little financial support from abroad. Saeed said Pakistan was in a position to present a strong case at the COP27 international climate talks in Egypt this November that other nations should help it pay to pick up the pieces. Developed and developing nations have remained generally divided over the issue for years. The developed world agreed more than a decade ago to transfer at least $100 billion a year by 2020 to developing nations to help their transitions away from fossil fuels, but also to help them adapt to climate change. That amount has never been delivered in full. More controversial is the issue of who should pay for the destruction. At the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow, the US was one of several advanced nations that showed opposition to obligatory payments for loss and damages  essentially climate compensation  particularly for schemes based on historic responsibility. Historically, the US accounts for the most greenhouse gas emissions in the world.",31/08/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/30/asia/pakistan-climate-crisis-floods-justice-intl/index.html
Sebastian Vettel believes world needs to ?ethink our behaviors?to tackle climate change,"Sebastian Vettel has never been afraid to speak his mind. But his mindset and approach to issues away from the track have developed with age and experience. Vettel  who announced he will retire from Formula One at the end of the season following a stellar career  spoke to CNN Sports Amanda Davies ahead of the Dutch Grand Prix about how hes planning to adjust to life at home with his family. But the 35-year-old expressed how, as hes grown older and been more receptive of issues away from the track, he is more willing to take steps to tackle them. It sounds a bit stereotype, but you turn 30 and I mean, I have kids, so things change, he explained. And as much as Im the same as I used to be 10 years ago, Im not the same and a lot of things have changed. So also, when it comes to interests or how you see the world and how you understand the world and I think Ive always been trying to see things, but maybe I didnt see as many things when I was young compared to today. Some things, Im thinking: What? How could you miss them? And one of the topics Vettel is very passionate about is climate change and the extent that should be taken to tackle the issue. Earlier this year, the four-time world champion said that climate change had made him question his job as a driver traveling the world to race cars. Vettel believes that the racing world is not doing enough to reinvest the vast profits it makes because the problem we are facing is bigger than we maybe understand. I feel theres a lot of money in Formula One, a lot of money that gets turned over and its about how much money we are happy to reinvest. And I think thats not just for Formula One, but for any businesses out there, Vettel said. Obviously, we have big events, a lot of people attending so you need to have the infrastructure in place to transport these people if you want to stop them coming by car, for example, which here in the Netherlands, works well because its so isolated and theres only two roads and it would be a disaster if everybody could come by car. F1 are attempting to tackle the issue of climate change with new engine regulations that will come into play in 2026. In these new generation of cars, the engines will use significantly less energy, will use fully sustainable fuels and will produce net zero exhaust CO2 emissions, while still preserving the same power and speed fans love. Vettel believes that if the sport wanted to implement those changes sooner, it could, but would require it to put internal problems aside. Obviously, to exercise our passion, we burn fuel and thats what people see. And if people criticize that, its fair, he said. Its fair to be criticized in a time where we are talking about approaching a winter where people might be not as comfortable as they used to be and might be freezing at home and will have to face very, very different problems, not being able to pay their bills, etc. and so on. So I think its right that we do see that and we try and challenge it. He added: It needs us, you and me, to rethink our behaviors and be happy with maybe changing some things and giving up some of the comfort. Lets face it, it boils down to comfort often. And on the other hand, it needs systematic change. It needs regulations and rules that dont allow you to hold the event unless you do certain things and you tick certain boxes. Like another great champion in another sport  Serena Williams  2022 is the year for Vettel to step away from the cockpit, hang up the helmet and retire from racing. Over his 15-year career, he became one of the sports most successful drivers, recording 53 race wins and 122 podiums. Between 2010 and 2013, he was the dominant driver in F1, winning the drivers championship title four successive years while driving for Red Bull. Only Lewis Hamilton and Michael Schumacher have claimed more wins than Vettel, who is currently in his second year racing for Aston Martin after a six-year stint with Ferrari. After such a distinguished career behind the wheel, Vettel is relishing the opportunity to spend more time with his three kids, without also having to worry about his performance on the track. It sounds maybe funny, but just to be also there when Im there and not in my thoughts and thinking of what I might need to do and prepare and think of to outsmart or outdrive the others, Vettel said. He added: And I know that the way I did this job for so many years and want to do it, and Im convinced it is right to do it, takes a big effort and a lot of energy. And if you try to do all the things at the same time, it doesnt work. So its been tough anyways, but I think Ive managed very well and to be there and to do this. I think that the time feels right to do other things, like I said, which is obviously a big part focusing on family life, but also discover new sides or new elements about me and the interests that I have and give them more space and more time and more room to explore really. But although he retires as one of the most successful drivers in F1 history, Vettel acknowledges that he will be forgotten due to the nature of time. For the racing, for what I have achieved on the track. But then that will be forgotten one day because theres new kids, theyre really doing great and they will continue to do great. And then there will be new kids again. So, hopefully, well have some girls and women in the future as well. I dont think I need to be remembered and Im not offended if people forget me in this regard. So I think Im happy with what I have achieved, but its normal that time goes on and theres new heroes to be celebrated.",04/09/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/09/04/motorsport/sebastian-vettel-climate-change-f1-spt-intl/index.html
Biden? Delaware vacation home faces ?xtreme?flood risk as climate change leads to rising seas,"As hes traveled the country to visit victims of storms, wildfires, and floods, President Joe Biden has returned to a similar theme: Climate change is everybodys crisis, as he declared last year after surveying flooded-out New York homes in the wake of Hurricane Ida. Biden doesnt say it explicitly, but that everybody includes himself. The Presidents vacation home near Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, is in the middle of a flood zone, and an analysis by a climate research group shows that the house is facing extreme flooding risk that is expected to get more severe over time. That means the nations homeowner-in-chief is among the millions of Americans who are facing climate-linked danger to their properties  and he has a big personal financial stake in the fight against the climate crisis. Bidens multi-million-dollar vacation home, which he has visited nearly a dozen times during his presidency, is in a quiet community tucked between a canal, the wetlands of a state park, and the Atlantic Ocean. Delaware has the lowest average elevation of any state, leaving neighborhoods like his in danger of being swamped during storms. Biden and his wife Jill bought the home in 2017 after he left the vice presidency, and the structure is elevated to avoid major damage from all but the most catastrophic floods. Elevation can be a powerful tool to protect against flood damage. Some climate advocates, while applauding Bidens legislative accomplishments, argue that his administration should do more to help other residents of flood zones raise their homes  in a similar manner to the Presidents summer retreat. And they note that areas like Bidens wealthy neighborhood, where streets are dotted with elevated homes, are far better protected from the impacts of climate change than poorer communities hit by disastrous flooding, from rural Kentucky to Jackson, Mississippi. When rain falls, it falls on those in power and those without power as well, said Daniel Gilford, a researcher at the nonprofit Climate Central. Climate change comes for all of us, but only some are wealthy enough to protect themselves. Bidens home is in North Shores, an unincorporated community about a mile north of Rehoboth Beachs tourist-filled boardwalk. The area was first developed in the 1950s and 60s on marshland that was filled in, government records and historic aerial photos show. Early newspaper articles promoted the developments rustic simplicity and maximum privacy. But the low-lying area also faced flooding and damage during multiple storms over the years, at times leaving streets inundated with up to six feet of water. Bidens six-bed, five-and-a-half-bath house was built near the developments north end in 2007, according to real estate listings. In June 2017, soon after signing a multi-million-dollar book deal, the Bidens bought the home for $2.74 million, property records show. Thanks to a pandemic-era jump in home prices, its now worth nearly $3.8 million, according to an estimate from the real estate website Redfin. The home overlooks the salt marshes of Cape Henlopen State Park  a former military site that Biden helped return to Delaware when he was a US senator, and where hes often spotted biking on weekends. The Rehoboth-Lewes Canal borders one side of the neighborhood, and North Shores private beach is about a half-mile walk away. The proximity to water from multiple directions comes with a downside. The home has an extreme risk of flooding  10 on a scale of 10  according to the climate research group First Street Foundation, which has used environmental science and computer modeling to estimate flood risk for every property in the US. Theres a 98% chance of flood water reaching Bidens house within the next five years, First Street found. Less than 5% of properties nationwide have as high a flood risk. The home is in FEMAs Special Flood Hazard Area  the zone that would be inundated during a 100-year flood. A rarer 500-year flood would be likely to inundate the property with just over 10 feet of water, according to First Streets national model. As climate change advances, the same flood would be expected to reach a depth of 11.4 feet in 30 years. And as Biden himself has noted, what used to be once-in-a-century storms are now happening every few years. In an apparent response to that risk, Bidens home was designed with flooding in mind. The living area is elevated about 10 feet off the ground, according to county records, with a broad exterior staircase leading to the double front doors and the ground floor used as a garage. Many of the first couples neighbors live at similar heights, with some huge homes suspended on stilts. New and significantly renovated homes are required by the county to be raised to a height known as the base flood elevation  five feet for much of the neighborhood. Steven Hollman, who owns a home around the block from Bidens and serves as the president of the North Shores Board of Governors, said the community has taken efforts to mitigate the risk from floods. That includes maintaining and replenishing their private beachs sand dunes at not insignificant expense, he said. The dunes are our first safeguard, Hollman said. If we have a breach of the dunes because of a cataclysmic weather event, then thats going to affect the entire community. Still, as climate change advances and sea levels rise, flooding that seeps up from the low-elevation marsh that borders Bidens property will likely become more common, according to University of Delaware professor John Callahan, who studies flood risk in the state. Eventually, it could mean high-tide flooding, with water regularly reaching streets even on days without major storms. A lot of flooding in neighborhoods like this is not from the ocean but from behind  the streams, marshes, and canals that all fill up and flood, Callahan said. The White House didnt respond to requests for comment about the homes flood risk, or whether the Bidens have flood insurance. While the first couple arent required to have flood insurance because they dont have a mortgage on the home, Hollman said flood insurance in North Shores is very common even for homeowners without mortgages. Bidens neighborhood is an example of how development near the coast can lead to more people facing flood danger decades later  a trend thats still happening today. The surrounding Sussex County has seen a boom in housing construction, and had more homes built in areas at high risk of flooding than almost any other coastal county in the US, according to a 2019 report from Climate Central. That kind of development is gambling on peoples future resilience, said Danielle Swallow, a coastal hazards specialist with the environmental organization Delaware Sea Grant. Its passing the risk on to homebuyers and future generations. Owning a home at risk from climate change doesnt necessarily make a president more likely to address the crisis. But Biden has advanced measures to help protect flood-prone areas  although experts say his administration could go further. Chad Berginnis, the executive director of The Association of State Floodplain Managers, said the administrations accomplishments included allocating more funding to build flood mitigation infrastructure projects, update rainfall frequency information, and expand flood maps. He called the progress on those issues very encouraging. Still, Berginnis said more should be done to help individual homeowners in flood zones raise or relocate their homes  key adaptation measures that have successfully protected communities. Going property by property is a slower slog, but its an effective solution, especially for many smaller communities that cant afford or maintain larger projects like seawalls, Berginnis said. While the infrastructure bill Biden signed last year increases funding for home elevations and other flood mitigation projects, experts say it doesnt meet the growing need. And the bulk of grant funding for home elevations has gone to wealthy and White neighborhoods, in part because federal programs take into account the higher property values in those areas, an investigation by Politico earlier this year found. FEMA has said it is working to address the disparity and help disadvantaged communities. (No homes in Bidens Rehoboth Beach-area zip code have received federal elevation grants, according to FEMA data.) Elevating homes can be pricey, and its easier to make the money work when properties have higher value, said Kristin Smith, a researcher with the nonprofit Headwaters Economics. That can end up excluding some of the people who need help the most, especially in low-income areas, she said. Research has found that poor and minority neighborhoods have been disproportionately affected by some climate change-linked flooding, and are likely to see the greatest increases in risk over time. Less privileged communities are also more likely to struggle to recover from flooding  especially compared to places like North Shores, where most houses are vacation homes, not primary residences. More broadly, Bidens recent climate legislation is the farthest-reaching bill of its kind in US history, and includes hundreds of billions of dollars to reduce the carbon emissions that lead to sea level rise. However, the spending package didnt fund programs like subsidized flood insurance that had been included in previous versions of the proposal. Biden isnt the only executive branch leader who has a home facing climate danger: Vice President Kamala Harris has spoken publicly about how her house in Los Angeles has been threatened by wildfire. And former President Donald Trumps Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida has a similar level of flood risk as Bidens vacation home, according to First Street. Trump spurned the scientific consensus on climate change, and unraveled or weakened dozens of environmental regulations during his time in the White House. Notably, Trump axed an Obama-era executive order that toughened building standards for federally funded construction projects in flood zones  and Biden brought it back. That contrast between two presidents who both like to vacation in areas threatened by rising seas shows the wide variations in how Americans respond to climate risk, Berginnis said. Presidents are people, and human nature is a funny thing, he said. They are going to come to their own approaches and conclusions.",13/09/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/09/13/politics/climate-change-biden-vacation-house-invs/index.html
Experts slam ?ittance?in aid to Pakistan as they find climate crisis played a role in floods,"An analysis of Pakistans devastating floods has found fingerprints of the human-made climate crisis on the disaster, which killed more than 1,500 people and destroyed so much land and infrastructure it has plunged the South Asian nation into crisis. The analysis, published Thursday by the World Weather Attribution initiative, was unable to quantify exactly how much climate change contributed to the floods  which were caused by several months of heavy rainfall in the region  but some of its models found that the crisis may have increased the intensity of rainfall by up to 50%, when looking specifically at a five-day downpour that hit the provinces of Sindh and Balochistan hard. The analysis also found that the floods were likely a 1-in-100-year event, meaning that there is a 1% chance of similarly heavy rainfall each year. If the world warms by 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures  as it is on course to  short rain bursts like those seen in the five-day period will likely become even more intense. The Earth is already around 1.2 degrees warmer than it was before industrialization. The scale of the floods and the WWA analysis highlight the enormous financial need to address impacts of the climate crisis. The kind of assistance thats coming in right now is a pittance, Ayesha Siddiqi, a geographer at the University of Cambridge, told journalists at a press conference. A number of Western economies have argued that theyre suffering their own crises, because of the war in Ukraine and various other issues. She described the UKs original assistance of 1.5 million ($1.7 million) as laughable. The UK has, however, increased its pledge to 15 million ($17 million) more recently. The geographical area that is now Pakistan was part of the former British colony of India until 1947, when the British partitioned the land into two separate dominions. Fully developed nations bear a far larger historical contribution to climate change than the developing world. Siddiqi said that the funds coming into Pakistan paled in comparison with the assistance sent after deadly floods that hit the country in 2010. The big global news [in 2010] was all about We must help Pakistan or the Islamists will win, she said, explaining that there was a fear in the West at the time that Islamist groups would take advantage of the floods aftermath to recruit more members. And this time around, of course, we dont have the same geopolitical imperative to help Pakistan, and so the aid has really been a pittance. Pakistan is responsible for around 0.6% of the worlds greenhouse gas emissions, even though it makes up nearly 2.7% of the global population, according to the European Unions global emissions database. China is the worlds biggest emitter, at 32.5%, and while the US is second, accounting for 12.6%, it is historically the biggest emitter globally. More than 33 million people in Pakistan have been impacted by the floods, which is more than the population of Australia or the state of Texas. The floods destroyed 1.7 million homes, swept away dozens of bridges and turned verdant farmland into fields of dust. The UN estimates the recovery could cost around $30 billion, which around the same value as the countrys annual exports. There were limitations to how much scientists could determine about the role of the climate crisis in the floods because the impacted area has such huge natural variability in rain patterns during monsoon seasons. Its also a year of La Nina, which typically brings heavier and longer rainfall to Pakistan. The role of climate change in heat waves  which also hit Pakistan and other parts of the Northern Hemisphere this year  is much larger and often clearer to determine in South Asia, the scientists said. A WWA study published in May found that pre-monsoonal heat waves in Pakistan and India were made 30 times more likely by climate change. Every year the chance of a record-breaking heat wave is higher than the year before, said Friederike Otto, co-founder of WWA and a climate scientist with the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London. The next heat wave in Pakistan will probably have quite devastating consequences, she said. Because even if everything is done now to invest in reducing vulnerability, that takes time. She said that while scientists couldnt determine exactly how much climate change contributed to the floods, it was probably closer to doubling their likelihood, as opposed to the 30-fold factor they found with the regions heat wave. The issue of who should pay for the impacts of the climate crisis, known as loss and damage, has long been a sticking point between developing and some developed nations, and is expected to be central to the upcoming COP27 international climate talks in Egypt. I think its absolutely justified to say, We need, finally, some real commitment to addressing loss and damage from climate change, Otto said. A lot of what leads to disaster is related to existing vulnerabilities and not to human-caused climate change. But of course, the Global North plays a very large role in that as well, because a lot of these vulnerabilities are from colonialism and so on. So there is a ... very huge responsibility for the Global North to finally do something real and not just talk.",15/09/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/09/15/asia/pakistan-climate-floods-attribution-intl/index.html
China lost its Yangtze River dolphin. Climate change is coming for other species next,"They called it the Goddess of the Yangtze  a creature so rare that it was believed to bring fortune and protection to local fishermen and all those lucky enough to spot it. But overfishing and human activity drove it to the brink of extinction and it hasnt been seen in decades. The baiji, or Yangtze River dolphin, was this unique and beautiful creature  there was nothing quite like it, said Samuel Turvey, a British zoologist and conservationist who spent more than two decades in China trying to track the animal down. It was around for tens of millions of years and was in its own mammal family. There are other river dolphins in the world but this one was very different, so unrelated to anything else, Turvey said. Its demise was more than just another species tragedy  it was a huge loss of river diversity in terms of how unique it was and left huge holes in the ecosystem. Experts have expressed grave concern that other rare native Yangtze animal and plant species are likely to suffer a similar fate to the baiji river dolphin as worsening climate change and extreme weather conditions take their toll on Asias longest river. China has been grappling with its worst heat wave on record and the Yangtze, the third longest river in the world, is drying up. With rainfall below average since July, its water levels have plunged to record lows of 50% of their normal levels for this time of year, exposing cracked river beds and even revealing submerged islands. The drought has already had a devastating effect on Chinas most important river, which stretches an estimated 6,300 kilometers (3,900 miles) from the Tibetan plateau to the East China Sea near Shanghai and provides water, food, transport and hydroelectric power to more than 400 million people. The human impact has been enormous. Factories were shut to preserve electricity and water supplies for tens of thousands of people have been affected. Less talked about, experts say, is the environmental impact that climate change and associated extreme weather events have had on the hundreds of protected and threatened wildlife and plant species living in and around the river. The Yangtze is one of the worlds most ecologically critical rivers for biodiversity and freshwater ecosystems  and we are still discovering new species yearly, said conservation ecologist Hua Fangyuan, an assistant professor from Peking University. Many of the little (known) and unknown fish and other aquatic species are most likely facing extinction risks silently and we simply do not know enough. Over the years conservationists and scientists have identified and documented hundreds of wild animal and plant species native to the Yangtze. Among them are the Yangtze finless porpoise which, similar to the baiji, faces extinction due to human activity and habitat loss, and critically endangered reptiles like the Chinese alligator and Yangtze giant softshell turtle  believed to be the largest living species of freshwater turtle in the world. Experts have also noticed a drastic decline of many native freshwater species of fish, like the now extinct Chinese paddlefish and sturgeon. At high risk is the Chinese giant salamander, one of the largest amphibians in the world. Wild populations have crashed, Turvey the zoologist said, and the species is now on the verge of extinction. Although they are a protected species, Chinese giant salamanders are under greater threat from climate change  increasing global temperatures and droughts will definitely do it no good when it is already extremely vulnerable, Turvey said. They have for a long time faced threats like poaching, habitat loss and pollution but when you add climate change into the mix, their chances of survival become drastically thin, he added. They can only live within freshwater environments and lower water levels would inevitably place greater pressure on their numbers across China. Nature conservation groups like the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) say the Yangtzes plight is a major concern not only for the Chinese people and government, but also for the wider international community. Rivers around the world, from Europe to the United States, have declined to historically low flow levels that are negatively impacting ecosystems, said its lead scientist Jeff Opperman. Reduced river flow and warmer waters in the Yangtze are a threat to freshwater species and increase pressure on already critically endangered animals like the remaining Yangtze finless porpoises and Chinese alligators left in the wild. Lower river levels also impact the health of (nearby) lakes and wetlands, which are vital to millions of migratory birds along the East Asian Flyway. Hua, the conservation ecologist, said more public awareness and greater efforts were needed to help Chinas shrinking great river. Humans depend on nature for survival, period. This is a lesson for any civilization, she said. The Yangtze is the longest river in China and (all of) Asia and has long been a cradle of civilization. Despite severe conservation threats and losses over the years, there is still much biodiversity to conserve in and along the Yangtze. Few would deny the importance and symbolism of the Yangtze. But experts say unless action is taken  and soon  more species will follow the fate of the baiji and Chinese paddlefish. Turvey, the British zoologist, warned against the sort of complacency that allowed the baiji to disappear. The Yangtze was a jewel in Asias crown. There is still so much biodiversity to fight for and we must not give up hope for saving species like giant salamanders, river reptiles and others, Turvey said. If theres anything we can learn from the death of the Yangtze River dolphin, its that extinction is forever and we cant afford to take it lightly.",18/09/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/09/17/china/china-yangtze-river-climate-change-endangered-species-scn-intl-hnk-dst/index.html
Senate approves treaty to combat climate crisis,"The Senate ratified an international climate treaty to phase out hydrofluorocarbons  potent greenhouse gases used in air conditioning and refrigeration. The vote was 69-27, with more than half of Republican senators objecting. In 2016, the United Nations struck an agreement known as the Kigali Amendment to the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. Senators who support ratifying the Kigali Amendment said its adoption would position US industries to lead the world in the creation of new, environmentally sound ways of cooling. This measure will go a long way to lowering global temperatures, while also creating tens of thousands of American jobs, and deal with the fact that China rarely participates in global cooperation when it comes to putting their own economy and jobs ahead of ours, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said. The Kigali amendment is supported by business groups like the Chamber of Commerce and environmental groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council. Advocates for its ratification said it would prevent global warming by up to half a degree Celsius, while benefiting manufacturers developing alternative products. Todays Senate vote was a decade in the making and a profound victory for the climate and the American economy, said US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry. In 2020, Congress passed a bill that directed the Environmental Protection Agency to significantly reduce HFCs in line with the goals of the Kigali Amendment. Last year, the Biden administration announced it would move to reduce the use of HFCs by 85% in the next 15 years. And in May, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee sent the ratification of the Kigali Amendment to the Senate floor without opposition. But since then, some Republicans have since grown wary that China agreed to the treaty on more advantageous terms since it is considered a developing country. The Senate passed an amendment from GOP senators Mike Lee of Utah and Dan Sullivan of Alaska designed to alleviate some of the Republican concerns that the agreement would treat China differently than other developed nations. Tennessee Sen. Bill Hagerty, a Republican member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told CNN that the treaty gives China an advantage that they dont deserve. We need to stand up and start addressing China in these multilateral forums, Hagerty said.",21/09/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/09/21/politics/kigali-amendment-senate-vote/index.html
Hurricane Ian? rapid intensification is part of a trend for the most dangerous storms,"Hurricane Ian strengthened rapidly Wednesday morning as it churned over the ultra-warm water of the Gulf of Mexico on its way toward Florida. The storms maximum wind speed increased by 35 mph in wind speed in less than three hours, going from a category 3 to a strong category 4 in the process. Ians rapid intensification  the second time it has done so  is something scientists say is becoming more likely for hurricanes as the climate crisis advances, pushing ocean temperatures higher and laying the groundwork for them to explode at breakneck pace into deadly major hurricanes. Rapid intensification is precisely what it sounds like  a hurricanes winds strengthening rapidly over a short amount of time. Scientists have defined it as a wind speed increase of at least 35 mph in 24 hours or less. And it has historically been a rare phenomenon, according to Allison Wing, an assistant professor of atmospheric science at Florida State University. It is really sort of at the extreme end of how quickly storms can intensify, Wing told CNN. Only something like 6% or so of all forecast time periods have those types of rapid intensification rates observed associated with them. And so its something thats by definition, a rare event. Sometimes it only happens a few times per season. Live updates: Florida braces for Hurricane Ian But human-caused climate change is stacking the deck in favor of more intense storms. So not only are they generating more rainfall and larger storm surge  they are also more likely to be stronger and are intensifying faster. Climate change is increasing both the maximum intensity that these storms can achieve, and the rate of intensification that can bring them to this maximum, said Jim Kossin, a senior scientist at the Climate Service. The intensification rates in Noru and Ian are good examples of very rapid intensification, and there have been many others recently. The phenomenon played out with breathtaking speed in the Philippines this weekend. Super Typhoon Noru exploded in strength on its final approach toward the Pacific island nation, going from the equivalent of a category 1 hurricane to a category 5 overnight as residents around Manila slept. Norus rapid intensification right before landfall  which was not predicted  likely meant locals had no time prepare for the much stronger storm. Hurricane Ians has been in the forecast for days, giving Cuba and Florida the benefit of time. Two ingredients must come together for rapid intensification to occur, Kossin told CNN. The first is that upper-level winds around the hurricane need to be weak  strong winds can prevent a storm from intensifying or even tear a storm apart. The second is that warm ocean water must extend well below the surface, going hundreds of feet deep, to provide enough fuel for the hurricane to strengthen. More than 90% of global warming over the past 50 years has taken place in the oceans, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The past five years have been the warmest on record for the worlds oceans. Scientists have shown humans are the dominant cause of the relentless warming trend. Planet-warming emissions from fossil fuels trap heat in the atmosphere, creating an energy imbalance. The oceans, in turn, absorb 90% of the excess heat, which has led to an alarming increase in temperature. And much of that warming has happened in the top levels of the ocean where hurricanes get their energy, said Jeff Masters, a meteorologist at Yale Climate Connections. Hurricanes and typhoons are heat engines, which means they take heat energy from the oceans and convert it to the kinetic energy that are winds, Masters told CNN. So if you increase the amount of heat energy in the ocean by warming it up, youre going to increase not only the maximum intensity they can get, but also the rate at which they get to that maximum intensity. A 2019 study found that Atlantic hurricanes in particular showed a highly unusual increase in rapid intensification from the 1980s to the early 2000s  a trend that could only be explained by human-caused climate change. And, concerningly, scientists found that the most significant changes were happening to the strongest storms, making the most life-threatening hurricanes even more dangerous. Climate change increases the odds that youll get a rapid intensifier, Masters said. Some of the United States most devastating recent hurricanes were ones that rapidly intensified right before landfall  something Hurricane Ian is not expected to do. Most recently, Hurricane Ida in 2021 strengthened from a category 1 to a strong category 4 in the 24 hours before it made landfall in Louisiana and left a trail of destruction in its wake from the Gulf Coast to the Northeast. Forecasters are getting better at seeing the signs of this phenomenon before it happens, though, which gives people along the coast more time to prepare for the worst. Kossin said there are several reasons for this. One is that meteorologists are becoming more confident in the computer forecast models, which are improving at seemingly light speed. The other is that they have seen more extreme cases of rapid intensification in recent years, which makes it easier to forecast them in the future. Masters told CNN it all adds up to better forecasts. The forecasts are unprecedented primarily because the [National] Hurricane Center is getting better at doing their job, Masters said. Weather models have gotten so much better. And our techniques for forecasting are getting better.",26/09/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/09/26/weather/hurricane-rapid-intensification-ian-noru-climate/index.html
Northern Hemisphere? extreme summer drought ?irtually impossible?without human-made climate change,"Drought across the Northern Hemisphere this summer  which scorched soil, dried up rivers and triggered mass crop failure  was made at least 20 times more likely by the climate crisis, a new analysis has found. The research, published Wednesday by the World Weather Attribution initiative, found that without the climate crisis, the drought that hit swaths of North America, Asia and Europe this summer would historically be a 1-in-400-year event  meaning it was a drought that was so intense, it would only be seen once every 400 years on average. But global warming caused by the burning of fossil fuels has made a drought of this magnitude a 1-in-20-year occurrence, the scientists found. The soaring temperatures experienced this summer, which contributed to the drought and killed tens of thousands of people across Europe and China, would have been virtually impossible without climate change, the analysis also found. The researchers used historical data, observations and scientific modeling, comparing conditions under todays climate  which is around 1.2 degrees Celsius warmer than it was before industrialization  with the climate that preceded it, before the late 1800s. The 2022 Northern Hemisphere summer is a good example of how extreme events caused by climate change can also unfold over large regions in longer periods of time. It also shows how the combination of many different changes in the weather can damage our infrastructure and overburden our social systems, Freiderike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College London and one of the studys authors, said in a statement. In Europe, drought conditions led to reduced harvests. This was particularly worrying, as it followed a climate change-fueled heatwave in South Asia that also destroyed crops, and happened at a time when global food prices were already extremely high due to the war in Ukraine. While much of the hemisphere experienced below-average rainfall this year, the analysis found that increasing temperatures was the main driver behind the drought. The scientists also noted their findings were conservative, and the real influence of human activities is likely higher than stated in the report. Across the Northern Hemisphere this summer, extreme heat and low rainfall led to several unprecedented events: China issued its first-ever a national drought alert; the United Kingdom recorded its highest-ever temperature; Europe experienced its hottest summer; and the water crisis in the US West intensified, prompting new water usage cuts. Alongside the immediate danger to life, the summers extreme heat posed severe threats to infrastructure, industry and food supply, fueling the ongoing cost of living crisis in many of the affected regions. Europe was already battling geopolitical shocks to supply. This climate-induced shock has further aggravated the cost of living crisis, compounding the impacts of the Ukraine war, said Maarten van Aalst, another of the reports authors and Director of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Center. We are witnessing the fingerprint of climate change not just in specific hazards, van Aalst said but also in the cascading of impacts across sectors and regions. Scientists are increasingly able to quantify the link between the climate crisis and extreme weather events. They can also more accurately make projections. The Northern Hemisphere can expect extreme temperatures  like those experienced this summer  much more frequently, the analysis found. This result also gives us an insight on what is looming ahead, said Dominik Schumacher, a researcher at the Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science at ETH Zurich. With further global warming we can expect stronger and more frequent summer droughts in the future. In this case, the water shortages, wildfires, crop failures, higher food prices and depleted electricity supply experienced over the past few months may become commonplace. The study follows not only a summer of extreme weather but also a destructive hurricane and typhoon season. The death toll from Hurricane Ian in the US had surpassed 100. Typhoon Noru ripped across the Philippines recently, after rapidly intensifying from the equivalent of a category 1 hurricane to a category 5 in around six hours. In November, world leaders will meet in Egypt for COP27, the UN Climate Change Conference, where extreme weather events this year will likely add to the urgency of discussions. Sonia Seneviratne, also a professor at ETH Zurich, said: We need to phase-out the burning of fossil fuels if we want to stabilize climate conditions and avoid a further worsening of these drought events, which will become more frequent and more intense with any additional increase of global warming.",05/10/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/10/05/world/northern-hemisphere-drought-climate-intl/index.html
"Opinion: As America grapples with the climate crisis, 9 experts weigh in with solutions","One in every three American adults say they have been personally affected by an extreme weather event in the past two years, according to Gallup. Public concern about the environment is near a two-decade high, according to a Gallup poll that found 44% of Americans worry a great deal about it. The polling organization says its the seventh year in a row that public worry over the issue is at a high level. Experts say were already seeing the effects of climate change, as extreme weather events  catastrophic hurricanes, droughts, floods and wildfires  ravage communities all around the world with greater frequency. For Katherine Keel, who had to evacuate from a wildfire in 2018, moving to the mountains of Colorado opened her eyes to the reality of a warming planet. Climate change has become an undeniable fact of life in this area and our safety, livelihoods and wellbeing are at stake, she wrote. We asked nine experts to propose solutions that would mitigate the impacts of global warming, cut greenhouse gas emissions and help us reach our net zero goals. After decades of stalling, the federal government is finally taking decisive action on climate change. The recent passage of the Inflation Reduction Act and other climate-related legislation has set the stage for significant progress toward cutting greenhouse gas emissions and building Americas renewable energy future. Its a great start, but federal policy alone wont get the job done. Bringing climate solutions into the world at scale requires that every part of the economy bring its superpower to bear: genuine business leadership moving markets, investors and philanthropists shifting capital, workers building solar panels and wind turbines, and cities and states making climate solutions a reality in the places we live and work. And all of this will be accelerated by community leaders and activists keeping the pressure up and demanding accountability. After all, leadership outside the Beltway pushed the climate agenda forward for years. Even before strong federal action, US emissions actually fell by 20% since 2007 and were on track to drop 30% by the 2030s. Now, thanks to federal investments, emissions are projected to drop by 40% instead. While federal legislation is critical, it will be responsible for roughly a quarter of these emissions reductions. Leadership from outside the Beltway will contribute the other 75%. Multiple forms of climate leadership, leveraging each other, are needed to get the job done  as long as the work is guided by science, a commitment to equity and justice, and an unfailing moral compass. And these other leaders can move quickly, along other fronts, and do things the federal government cant do  with less delay and political compromise. In the end, its leadership from all of us  in the private sector, government and diverse communities around the nation  that will be needed to address climate change. And its time for all of us to step up. Jonathan Foley (@GlobalEcoGuy) is the executive director of Project Drawdown, a science-based nonprofit that leads efforts for climate solutions. Jamie Alexander (@jabeckx) is the director of Drawdown Labs at Project Drawdown. Transportation is the biggest contributor to US greenhouse gas emissions, and the shift from gasoline to electric cars will play a key role in the fight against climate change. But the mining of materials to make electric vehicle (EV) batteries presents numerous challenges, including supply chains vulnerable to disruption and harmful social and environmental consequences. Given that the demand for these materials is only expected to increase, recycling EV batteries provides an opportunity to build a more sustainable future while shoring up domestic supply chains. When an EV battery has reached the end of its life, materials recovered from battery recycling can be used to make new ones, reducing the need for mining. Recycling infrastructure is already growing in North America. Estimates show that, in 2050, recycled materials have the potential to meet roughly half of the demand for cobalt and nickel, and a quarter of the demand for lithium for EVs in the United States. Ensuring all batteries are eventually recycled is key to increasing EV sustainability, and policy can help. In the US, there has been government-funded research and development into new recycling processes, and the California legislature convened stakeholders to explore policy solutions. But the European Union and China are ahead of the US in enacting recycling requirements for EV batteries. We can do more at the federal and state level. Switching to EVs is essential to slow climate change and create a sustainable future. Smart policies that encourage battery recycling are an important part of the solution. Jessica Dunn is a senior analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists, specializing in lithium-ion battery sustainability. She conducts research on material circularity and reducing battery impacts through repurposing and recycling. Recent deadly monsoon flooding in Pakistan and tens of billions of dollars in damage in the wake of Hurricane Ian in the US serve as reminders that extreme weather is affecting people on a previously unthinkable scale. Climate change intensifies disasters that push people from their homes, creating climate migrants all around the world. In fact, environmental disasters are already the leading cause of internal displacement globally  more than war or conflict, according to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre. While many migrants relocate within their country, a growing number have to cross international borders to find safety, including to the United States. Unfortunately, our immigration laws have yet to keep pace and need to be updated to include protections for climate migrants. The good news is there are common sense actions the US can take to address this issue: Its rare that the right thing and the smart thing align  but in this case they do. The US has contributed the most to carbon emissions over time, and addressing climate migration provides an opportunity to ensure equity, mitigate our demographic deficit, and uphold the dignity and safety of climate migrants all at once. Climate change is not an insurmountable future issue, its a solvable present-day one. As we approach the upcoming midterm elections, its imperative that candidates recognize that fact and commit to supporting these solutions if elected. Ama Francis is a climate displacement project strategist with the International Refugee Assistance Project and a non-resident fellow at the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University Law School. The historic investments in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) reflect what many state officials have already acknowledged: We must take urgent steps to curb the climate crisis. State governments have a crucial role in the equitable implementation of the IRA, as residents of their states increasingly experience the traumas of losing their homes, loved ones and livelihoods through climate-fueled disasters such as wildfires, hurricanes and droughts. The impacts of the climate crisis are not confined to either blue or red states, but are felt in communities across the nation. This includes low-income communities and communities of color in Michigan, for example, that are among the most polluted in the country and have higher than average rates of asthma. It includes communities of coal miners suffering from black lung disease and struggling with access to medical care. These communities and many more remain in desperate need of support  which the IRA can provide. The IRAs investments include more than 100 programs that will invest $369 billion in climate action, clean energy jobs and environmental justice. This gives states the means to create family-sustaining jobs, improve the health of communities and mitigate the impacts of climate change. One challenge is to channel funds efficiently, equitably and transparently from federal to state and local agencies. Governors should establish executive offices to ensure community organizations are active participants. Governors should issue executive orders enacting the Biden-Harris administration Justice40 initiative to invest in disadvantaged communities at the state level, similar to Gov. Roy Cooper in North Carolina while remaining transparent like Governor Steve Sisolak in Nevada on infrastructure funding. As voters go to the ballot box, we must cast our votes for candidates who will proactively address our collective problems, not score petty political points. Lets make communities, climate action and environmental justice the true winners this election season. Ramon Cruz is the president of the Sierra Club. Climate debates in Washington are often based on false choices: renewables versus fossils, economy versus environment, 100% global emissions reduction versus inaction at home. The truth is, no government or business will achieve climate goals and see economic success unless all energy resources are on the table. So, lets ask ourselves some key questions. If solutions are only focused on reducing emissions to net zero here in the US while China continues emitting, what have we really accomplished? If Americas power sector transitioned entirely to clean energy at the cost of reliability or affordability, would the public support the change? Will our industry move overseas to higher emitting locations? Economic inflation, high gas and electricity prices, global supply chain chaos, Russias war in Ukraine and Chinas effort to dominate markets have all combined to create an ongoing energy crisis. Lawmakers in both parties can work together on the biggest question: How do we restore American energy independence while working to solve the climate challenge? There is a path both parties can follow. First, leverage American innovation and make clean energy cheaper. If two technologies are the same price and one is cleaner, utilities and industries worldwide will buy the cleaner alternative. Second, lawmakers can modernize permitting to build cleaner and faster. Nobody argues against protecting the environment, but it shouldnt take nearly five years on average to site a solar field, wind farm, natural gas plant or new transmission line. We need to cut approval periods by more than half. Third, lets think global and lead with America first. US emissions are trending down from 14% to 12.7% of the global total, and unless we equip other nations with clean technology, our efforts will never solve the global problem. If we eliminate the false choices and unleash American resource independence, we can solve the climate challenge. Rich Powell is CEO of ClearPath, a Washington, DC-based nonprofit that develops and advances policies that accelerate breakthrough innovations to reduce emissions in the energy and industrial sectors. We cannot move toward a more just climate future if we continue to build infrastructure the way we have for the past century. We need to stop relying solely on shored-up single-purpose gray infrastructure like bulkheads and seawalls and start embracing blue-green infrastructure and the complexity of natural systems. This means preserving natural areas that are still intact and reviving landscape systems at a regional and national scale. Blue-green infrastructure works with nature, instead of against it  combining carbon capture, improved resilience, greater adaptability and greater biodiversity  while being less expensive to maintain and operate. Demonstration projects already exist. In Raritan Bay, just off Staten Island in New York, were in the process of building Living Breakwaters, nature-based infrastructure that will reduce the risk of wave damage, mitigate erosion along the beach and create a habitat for marine species  including oysters that can help filter the water and, we hope, catalyze more projects like it. Louisiana is currently wrapping up its 2023 Coastal Master Plan, which includes some of the largest restoration projects in US history, such as sediment diversions  designed to redirect water, sediment and nutrients to starving wetlands, mimicking the natural processes that once enabled them to thrive so this critical natural infrastructure can continue to help mitigate flooding and erosion. Were at an inflection point for the climate movement. The passing of the Inflation Reduction Act marks a paradigm shift so big that its easy to overlook $2.6 billion in grants the law allocates to coastal communities and tribes for climate adaptation. This is a tremendous investment in nature-based infrastructure. The next step? Connecting the dots: linking shovel-ready, blue-green infrastructure projects to funding, creating more precedents for enhancing ecosystems and ensuring communities have a personal and economic stake in their implementation. Pippa Brashear, is the resilience principal at SCAPE, a landscape architecture and urban design firm based in New York, New Orleans and San Francisco. She leads design and planning teams on large-scale climate adaptation and infrastructure projects across the US. For those of us who have spent decades urging Congress to enact strong climate legislation, it is difficult to believe that, in one year, Congress enacted three significant pieces of legislation designed to rapidly accelerate clean energy development and deployment. Most of the focus has been on the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Job Act. Together these laws will deploy clean energy technologies  most of which are already commercially available after years of development  at a pace and scale necessary to put us in striking distance of our 2030 climate goals. This is fantastic, but we cant stop there. In order to meet our net zero goals by 2050, we will need to rely on new technologies, much of which is still at the prototype phase, according to the International Energy Agency. This brings us to the third and often overlooked piece of legislation: the CHIPS and Science Act (CHIPS). Most of the attention around CHIPS has focused on funding it has allocated to revive the American semiconductor industry. But, within CHIPS, there are critically important  but unfunded  provisions, which provide the framework and research policies necessary to bring emerging clean energy technologies to commercial viability at the pace necessary to meet the climate challenge. Research and development can sound boring, but it is the essential ingredient for all innovation. The government has consistently played a leadership role in funding ongoing R&D across all sectors of the economy and embracing risks the private sector wont  all in the name of the public good. While CHIPS merely authorized funding, Congress must now appropriate the money for these provisions, which will go toward advancing energy storage, fusion energy, artificial photosynthesis and carbon sequestration research, among other things.

She is an attorney and advocate who oversees WRIs legislative work, its strategy on climate change and energy issues, and its engagement with the US administration and corporate partners on these issues. Rising sea levels will continue exacerbating beach erosion for decades  and even centuries  in the US. Low-lying cities and communities currently exposed to regular coastal floods, erosion and direct wave impact are at greater risk. In Puerto Rico, for example, rising sea levels have placed 60% of its 1,225 beaches at risk of moderate to severe erosion, according to a report from Puerto Ricos Climate Change Council. The islands situation is particularly alarming since 61% of its population lives in the 44 coastal municipalities where flooding and storm surges have devastated communities in recent years. Meanwhile, in Florida, more than 425 miles of beaches are already critically eroded, according to the states Department of Environmental Protection. Last month, storm surge caused by Hurricane Ian obliterated several coastal communities. The combined effect of rising sea levels and catastrophic storms will only cause more harm to these populations. It is imperative that cities and states come up with protection and adaptation interventions at built-up areas that currently experience coastal floods and beach erosion. Protection may not be available to all due to the expensive nature of these plans, the complicated cost-benefit analysis process of agencies like the US Army Corps of Engineers and, in some cases, because communities refuse to retreat. Higher-cost public and private infrastructure are more likely to get funding for protection. However, low-income communities may not be eligible for federally funded projects, mainly because these communities have experienced significant floods for generations. This evidences the need to foster a balanced and equitable approach to reduce coastal risk. While protection or retreat may be a challenge for developed areas, municipalities can use available sea-level rise projections to reduce risks through planning and updated building codes. Cities must develop land use plans and zoning regulations for the next several decades in order to reduce vulnerability and ensure that future investments meet and exceed the new infrastructure requirements. Building codes and design standards must also be updated. Construction codes and standards play a vital role in building resiliency and adaption to projected sea-level rise. Measures such as building elevation, foundation design and others meant to combat moisture entrapment and damage from debris are key to ensure infrastructure resilience.

"World still way off track on goal to keep global warming below dangerous threshold, UN says","Nations are still way off track to limit global warming below a dangerous threshold as catastrophic extreme weather events are already threatening the health and food security of people around the world, a pair of reports have found. The United Nations reported Wednesday that global warming will rise to between 2.1 and 2.9 degrees Celsius based on the worlds current climate pledges  way beyond the 1.5 degrees nations are trying to stay below. The report shows that there is still much more work to be done to transition away from planet-warming fossil fuels, which are pushing global temperatures higher and triggering more intense extreme weather events. Average global temperature has already risen around 1.2 degrees since the industrial revolution. The UN report comes ahead of its COP27 climate summit in November, where countries will meet to raise their ambition on the global crisis. Experts said the latest UN numbers show that countries need to be more ambitious on their climate commitments. The report sounds the alarm that progress on climate commitments has slowed to a crawl since the Glasgow climate summit last year, Taryn Fransen, senior fellow at the World Resources Institutes climate program, told CNN in a statement. Fransen added that the UNs finding of the world warming 2.1 to 2.9 degrees Celsius is dangerously high. A separate report from the Lancet found that the health of people around the world is at the mercy of a persistent fossil fuel addiction. But despite the health harms, governments and companies continue prioritizing fossil fuels to the detriment of peoples health. The Lancet report said that continuing to pursue fossil fuel energy would lock the world into a fatally warmer future with catastrophic health impacts. According to the report, extreme heatwaves in 2020 were associated with 98 million more people suffering from moderate to severe food insecurity than annually in 1981-2010. And from 2017 to 2021, heat-related deaths increased 68% compared to 2000-2014, the report found. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement that livelihoods and natural economies are being pummeled, as the fossil fuel addiction spirals out of control. The climate crisis is killing us, Guterres said. It is undermining not just the health of our planet, but the health of people everywhere. Inger Andersen, executive director of the United Nations Environment Program, told CNN that the UNs findings on global climate targets underscore the need for urgent action to transition to clean energy and away from fossil fuels. Andersen said that 1.5 degrees is a goal that is still on the map, but the longer we procrastinate, that window is closing. She noted that even if countries met all their new climate pledges, combined with net zero commitments, it would get the globe to 1.8 degrees of warming by 2100. The pathway we are on today, that doesnt get us there, said Andersen. If we want to hit 1.5, we need to reduce our emissions by 45% by 2030. Thats a large percentage. Is that doable? Its in our hands  we developed a vaccine in less than a year. I dont want to say its impossible. But it will take commitment, leadership, bravery, and real courage by leaders to make it happen.",26/10/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/10/26/world/un-global-climate-pledges-health/index.html
Antarctica? emperor penguins at risk of extinction due to the climate crisis,"As Antarcticas emperor penguins are increasingly threatened by the climate crisis, the flightless seabirds will receive new protections under the Endangered Species Act, or ESA. With global warming melting the sea ice the penguins depend on for their survival, the US Fish and Wildlife Service now categorizes the species as threatened. The federal agency lists imperiled species as endangered or threatened regardless of their country of origin. The Tuesday announcement came more than a year after an initial proposal by the service to protect emperor penguins under the ESA. Emperor penguins rely on sea ice to form their breeding colonies, avoid predators in the ocean and forage for food. But as Earths temperature rises in relation to greenhouse gas and carbon dioxide emissions, sea ice is at risk of disappearing. When sea ice melts or breaks apart earlier in the season than expected due to global warming, entire penguin colonies can decline or disappear. This listing reflects the growing extinction crisis and highlights the importance of the ESA and efforts to conserve species before population declines become irreversible, said Martha Williams, US Fish and Wildlife Service director, in a statement. Parts of the Antarctic Peninsulas sea ice have melted by more than 60% in 30 years, according to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts. And if emperor penguins suffer and decline, its likely that other species within the ecosystem are also at risk due to the climate crisis. Emperor penguins forage for krill, fish and squid in the sea, but they also serve as prey for leopard seals and killer whales. Climate change is having a profound impact on species around the world and addressing it is a priority for the (Biden) Administration. The listing of the emperor penguin serves as an alarm bell but also a call to action, Williams said. There are about 61 emperor penguin breeding colonies along Antarcticas coastline, which in total consist of between 270,000 to 280,000 breeding pairs (or 625,000 and 650,000 individual penguins, including juveniles), according to the US Fish and Wildlife Service. The bird population is currently stable, but research has suggested that the emperor penguins population will decrease by 26% to 47% by 2050, or drop to 185,000 or 132,500 breeding pairs, according to the service. Emperor penguins are the tallest and heaviest of the 18 penguin species. They can weigh up to 88 pounds (40 kilograms) and stand 45 inches (1.1 meters) tall. A female emperor lays one egg per breeding season, then passes it over to her male partner to incubate while she forages for food for about a two-month period. Once the female bird returns, she shares parenting duties with her partner until their chick leaves the colony about 150 days after birth. The chick is then able to look after itself and set out for open water to forage. But first, the chick must shed its down before growing the waterproof feathers it uses to swim  if its still covered in down when the ice breaks, itll sink and drown. Listing the species as threatened now could help save emperor penguins from becoming endangered or extinct in the future. The Endangered Species Act is the worlds strongest environmental law focused on preventing extinction and facilitating recovery of imperiled species, according to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. The polar bear was the first species listed as threatened due to climate change under the Endangered Species Act in 2008. Since then, many of the worlds polar bear populations have stabilized, but they remain vulnerable as the climate crisis continues. The listing can help establish strategies to increase the resilience of threatened species and reduce threats to their existence. For emperor penguins, this means international cooperation on conservation practices, increased funding for conservation efforts and likely more research into the species. Listing emperor penguins as a threatened species is an important step for raising awareness about the impact of climate change, said Stephanie Jenouvrier, associate scientist and seabird ecologist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, in a statement. Emperor penguins, like many species on earth, face a very uncertain future, which is dependent on people working together to reduce carbon pollution. We should draw inspiration from the penguins themselves; only together can penguins brave the harshest climate on Earth, and only together can we face a difficult climate future. Emperor penguins are an ideal species to study in a fluctuating ecosystem because their population numbers and behavior can indicate if something is wrong. By studying the birds, Dan Zitterbart, an associate scientist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and his team can learn about the impacts of the climate crisis in Antarctica. Emperor penguins are a sentinel species that highlight the vulnerability of ice-dependent species in a rapidly warming world, said Zitterbart. Although they live far from human activity, the far-reaching effects of climate change present the most substantial threat facing the species survival. Since 2017, Zitterbart and other researchers have been tagging 300 penguin chicks per year with a system similar to the way dogs and cats are microchipped. The initiative is part of the MARE project, which aims to measure the health of the Antarctic marine ecosystems through long-term monitoring of emperor penguin populations over the next 30 years. By tracking and studying penguin behavior, researchers can observe how the animals adapt as their environment shifts due to the climate crisis. Microchipping the penguins allows the team to determine where the penguins go when they dive off the sea ice into the ocean and understand their foraging strategies. This insight can help determine the size of marine protected areas. If greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise at their current rates, leading to warming temperatures and melting Antarctic sea ice, 98% of the emperor penguin population could all but disappear by 2100, according to a study published last year in the journal Global Change Biology. The world needs to take aggressive actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions now, and the Paris Climate Agreement objectives must be met, to help prevent further population declines, Jenouvrier said.",29/10/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/10/29/world/emperor-penguins-threatened-species-climate-scn/index.html
"California? climate crisis is intensifying quickly and taking a heavy toll on residents, new data reveals","Californias climate crisis is quickly intensifying, impacting every resident and increasingly taking a toll on the health and well-being of its people and on its unique and diverse ecosystems, new state data reveals. The ominous findings are from the Indicators of Climate Change in California Report, which was published through Californias Environmental Protection Agency. The stark reality of climate change in California is clear: record-high temperatures, an unrelenting drought, and unprecedented wildfires. The evidence continues to mount of the impacts of climate change on the health, safety, and well-being of the states residents, authors of the report wrote. The extensive report documents the causes and impacts of climate change by studying 41 scientifically measured indicators provided by more than 100 experts from state and federal agencies, research institutions, academia and includes input from 40 Native American tribes. One of the most significant climate change impacts in California than the states recent extreme heat and multiyear drought. In September 2021, the entire state of California was in a drought, with 88% in the most severe tiers of extreme to exceptional drought, the climate change report says. That marked a one-month snapshot of a much longer trend: The last two decades were the driest in the past millennium, according to the report, which points to a 2.5-degree Fahrenheit increase in temperature since 1895 with that rise accelerating since the 1980s, said Amy Gilson, CalEPAs deputy director for external and legislative affairs. This is driven primarily by warmer nights which are getting warmer at a rate three times faster than daytime temperatures, Gilson said, noting that extreme heat events are becoming more frequent across the state. Just this past September, the West Coast broke nearly 1,000 temperature records during a 10-day heat wave, CalEPA said. As many areas baked under triple-digit heat for several consecutive days, thousands of California residents were asked to ration their power use to avoid straining the grid. California is on the front lines of the climate crisis  and the latest data shows the impacts are rapidly accelerating, Daniel Villasenor, Gov. Gavin Newsoms deputy press secretary, said in a statement to CNN. Governor Newsom has taken more action to combat climate change than at any time in our history  the California Climate Commitment invests a record $54 billion to accelerate the transition to clean energy, cut pollution, and protect Californians from extreme weather. The Governor is just getting started because he understands the urgency this moment demands, Villasenor added. As temperatures rise and precipitation declines, annual snowpack and glaciers are vanishing from Californias high elevations, which in turn is straining reservoir and river levels in the state. In the Trinity Alps, the glaciers and snowfields have virtually disappeared, Gilson said. In the Sierra Nevada, some of the largest glaciers have lost 65% - 90% of their area. These shrinking glaciers represent a decline in freshwater supplies crucial for ecological needs. Declining freshwater supply impacts the salmon population. It also impacts irrigation for agriculture  more than a third of the countrys vegetables and 75% of its fruits and nuts are grown in California, according to the California Department of Food and Agriculture. And the changes in temperature are also having an adverse effect on a wide range of species. In the Mojave Desert, bird populations have collapsed, said Gilson, adding that 75% to 85% of the mammals and birds surveyed in the Sierra Nevada have changed where they are living. Theyve changed their elevations. The last 20 years saw a severe uptick in wildfires erupting across California, according to the report. More than 4 million acres were charred in wildfires in 2020, more than doubling the area burned during any other year on record. Plus, half of the states largest wildfires in the past 70 years happened in 2020 and 2021, exacerbated by the hotter and drier weather and the ongoing megadrought. Overall, the average number of acres burned has increased dramatically in the last few years. Climate change is also impacting human health, the report noted. Heat-related illnesses reported by California workers rose about threefold from 2000 to 2017, particularly impacting farm workers, police officers and firefighters. Also, recent wildfires have led to deaths and injuries as well as widespread exposure to harmful levels of wildfire smoke, according to the report. Native American tribes also pointed to climate change leading to soil erosion, loss of wetlands and springs, loss of plants as well as changes to animal migration patterns  which in turn cause a shift in diet and cultural practices. These impacts are tied to water, heat, wind and fire hazards and without a return of water to the area, Gilson said. This story has been updated with a statement from Gov. Gavin Newsoms office.",02/11/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/11/02/us/california-climate-crisis-impact-report/index.html
What are ?missions??What is ?et zero??Here are the climate change terms you should know,"The whole world seems to be talking about the climate crisis, thanks to months of wild weather and new science showing that we need to act quicker than we previously thought to avoid the worst consequences. As global leaders meet in the Egyptian resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh for annual climate talks, theyll be using a lot of technical lingo. But the terminology isnt particularly helpful and can be daunting. Even the name of the summit  COP27  sounds more like a bad police drama than a climate event. (First pointer: COP is short for Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on Climate Change. It convenes global leaders, scientists and negotiators on climate, and usually takes place annually. The 27 means this will be the 27th meeting.) Here are other terms to know to keep up with the talks, understand whats at stake and, most importantly, sound smart around the dinner table. A key goal of recent COPs, and of the fight against climate change in general, is keeping 1.5 alive, which refers to a target to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels. Its a target that some fossil fuel-producing countries have resisted, and scientists have warned of significantly worse impacts if this threshold is breached. The countries that signed the Paris Agreement in 2015 agreed to limit the increase in global temperatures to well below 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels, but preferably to 1.5 degrees. However, a UN report released in October found that current pledges and plans to reduce emissions will not get us anywhere close to staying under this threshold. The latest global pledges, including some made in the past year since COP26, will reduce planet-warming emissions in 2030 by about 5%  but a 45% reduction is whats needed to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees. Under current climate policies, the report said that the world will reach 2.8 degrees by 2100. The UNs Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in its latest state-of-the-science report that the world has already warmed by 1.1 degrees above than pre-industrial levels, and is now hurtling fast toward 1.5 degrees. Scientists have showed that the world needs to transition away from fossil fuel and toward renewable energy to keep global temperatures from rising more. Renewable energy comes from sources that cant run out, and the term is typically used to describe energy sources that have no or very low planet-warming emissions. Although they were created in natural processes, fossil fuels like coal, gas and oil are limited in that they take millions of years to form deep underground. Common examples of renewable energy include wind, solar and geothermal. Wind turbines harnesses the atmospheres natural kinetic energy and converts it into electricity. The planets potential to generate wind energy is vast, particularly in very windy locations offshore. Solar power is generated by converting sunlight  our most abundant natural energy resource  into electricity through photovoltaic panels. Geothermal energy involves using the Earths heat thats way below ground level to heat homes, water or generate electricity. This usually refers to average concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere before the Industrial Revolution, which started in the late 18th century. CO2 levels are estimated to have been around 280 parts per million at that time. By 2021, that concentration had risen to 415.7 parts per million, according to the latest Greenhouse Gas Bulletin released by the World Meteorological Organization ahead of COP27. Scientists also talk about pre-industrial levels for average temperatures, using the period 1850-1900 to determine how hot or cold the Earth was before humans began emitting greenhouse gases in large volumes. Net zero emissions can be achieved by removing as much greenhouse gas from the atmosphere as whats emitted, so the net amount added is zero. To do this, countries and companies will need to rely on natural methods  like planting trees or restoring grasslands  to soak up carbon dioxide, the most abundant greenhouse gas we emit, or use technology to capture the gas as its emitted so it doesnt enter the atmosphere. Dozens of countries have already pledged to achieve net zero by mid-century and there is huge pressure on the remaining countries to do so. To save the world from the worst effects of climate change, scientists say its probably not enough to reach net zero  weve got to hit negative emissions. Negative emissions is the situation where the amount of greenhouse gas removed from the atmosphere is actually more than the amount humans emit. This would require a significant energy overhaul as countries would need to ramp up renewable energy rapidly and invest heavily in technology to suck emissions out of the atmosphere. This is a reservoir that absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and locks it away. Natural sinks like trees and other vegetation remove CO2 from the atmosphere through photosynthesis  plants use the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to grow. The ocean is also a major carbon sink because of phytoplankton which, as a plant, also absorbs carbon dioxide. Scientists say preservation and expansion of natural sinks  like the Amazon Rainforest  are crucial to reducing emissions. There are also artificial carbon sinks that can store carbon and keep it out of the atmosphere. More on that below. Technology to remove and contain carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is known as carbon capture and storage. Carbon is usually captured at source  directly from coal, oil or gas as it burns  but new technology is being developed to literally suck carbon from the ambient air. In both cases, the carbon can be stored, usually buried in reservoirs underground or below the floor of the sea, in what are known as artificial carbon sinks. Some scientists warn that it could be risky to inject so much carbon underground, and this process isnt currently used on a large scale. The Global CCS Institute says just 27 commercial facilities are fully operating worldwide, while more than 100 others are in development. But other experts say this technology is necessary to put a real dent in our emissions. There are many ways to capture and store carbon. Here are some of them: Nationally Determined Contributions  or NDCs  is a term used by the UN for each countrys individual national plan to slash greenhouse gas emissions. In the 2015 Paris Agreement, which nearly the whole world signed on to, countries were given the freedom to determine themselves how they would go about meeting the agreements key targets to slow global warming. NDCs are supposed to be updated every five years and submitted to the UN, the idea being that each countrys ambition will grow over time. More than 10 years ago at COP16 in Cancun, Mexico, the developed world agreed to transfer money to developing countries to help them limit or reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the climate crisis. They set up the Green Climate Fund (GCF) to facilitate some of this transfer, but countries and donors can send money through any means they like. The money was supposed to build up and reach $100 billion annually by 2020, and that commitment was reaffirmed in the Paris Agreement. This money is often referred to broadly as climate finance. But the 2020 target was missed, and filling the gap is high on the agenda for the talks in Egypt this year. Developing nations, particularly those in the Global South, which are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, argue that industrialized nations are historically more responsible for climate change and must do more to fund changes to help developing nations adapt and transition their economies to renewable energy. US President Joe Biden pledged to double the US existing contribution plans, including money for the Green Climate Fund, in a speech at the UN General Assembly in 2021. Whether Biden can marshal that much funding is still unclear; Congress has not yet finished its appropriations process for the coming fiscal year, and it remains to be seen whether the amount of money the president wants for climate finance can pass by the end of the year. Adaptation refers to the way humans can change their lives and infrastructure to better cope with the impacts of climate change. These changes might include building early warning systems for floods, or barriers to defend against rising sea level, for example. In some places where rainfall is decreasing, planting drought-resistant varieties of crops can help ensure communities have enough food to eat. Put simply, this refers to how humans can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, or remove them from the atmosphere, to ease the consequences of climate change. Examples include using fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas more efficiently for industrial processes, switching from coal and gas to renewable energy sources such as wind or solar power for electricity, choosing public transport to commute over private vehicles that run on gasoline, and expanding forests and other means of absorbing carbon. You might hear leaders talking about ending unabated coal use. Unabated coal refers to coal burned in power stations where no action  or abatement  is taken to reduce the greenhouse gases emitted by its use. In short, this creates a loophole for to keep using coal in a net-zero world, if the greenhouse gas it emits is captured. Very few coal plants in the world, however, are using abatement technologies, and transitioning to renewables is often more economically feasible in the long term than employing them. In its 2021 report Net Zero by 2050, the International Energy Agency states that a rapid shift will be needed away from fossil fuels to achieve the goal, requiring steps such as phasing out all unabated coal and oil power plants by 2040. Thats electric vehicles to you and me. As electricity generated by renewables, like wind and solar, becomes more available, people are expected to start buying electric vehicles in greater numbers, especially as they become more affordable. That will mean fewer cars powered by oil on the roads, which will be a major topic at COP27 given the global energy crunch amidst Russias war in Ukraine. There may also be references to PHEVs  those are plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, which are mostly powered by a battery charged from an electrical source but also have a hybrid internal combustion engine to allow travel over longer distances. This refers to the idea that the drastic changes needed to combat climate change should be fair to everyone. As environmental campaign group Greenpeace says: Put simply, a just transition is about moving to an environmentally sustainable economy (thats the transition part) without leaving workers in polluting industries behind. It aims to support good quality jobs and decent livelihoods when polluting industries decline and others expand, creating a fairer and more equal society  thats what makes it just. Biodiversity refers to all the Earths living systems, on land and in the sea. The UNs Global Biodiversity Outlook report published just over two years ago warned that the accelerating climate crisis was worsening the outlook for biodiversity  that can mean all the trees, plants and animals in a forest, or all the fish and coral in a reef. Biodiversity is declining at an unprecedented rate, and the pressures driving this decline are intensifying, it said. Challenges include habitat loss and degradation, mass extinction of species, declining wetlands, and pollution by plastic and pesticides. Last year, the G7 countries  the seven largest advanced economies  agreed to conserve 30% of land and sea in their nations to protect biodiversity, a pledge they reaffirmed in 2022.",05/11/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/11/05/world/climate-change-terms-explained-cop27/index.html
The world needs India to avert climate catastrophe. Can Modi deliver?,"Its not unusual for temperatures in Indias Thar Desert to reach 48 degrees Celsius (118 degrees Fahrenheit). Even when they drop, hot winds sweep across the bare plains. The soil here is infertile, water is scarce. This place is near unlivable for humans  but its ideal for one of the worlds biggest solar farms. The Bhadla Solar Park in Rajasthan state, near Indias border with Pakistan, is a symbol of Prime Minister Narendra Modis gargantuan ambitions to transform his nation into a green energy powerhouse. By 2030, Modi wants half of Indias energy to come from renewables. Its a huge and admirable goal from the worlds third-biggest carbon emitter, but achieving it will require trillions of dollars and some tough decisions by Modi. While renewable energy is growing faster in India than in any other major economy, the country remains reliant on coal, which has long powered the countrys growth and accounts for more than 80% of its energy mix. Indian officials have also said the country plans to expand its use of the fossil fuel even as many of its nearly 1.4 billion people choke on the pollution it causes. In the past, India has defended its use of planet-warming fossil fuels in the name of development  a stance that has seen it criticized at international climate talks. At last years COP26 negotiations in Glasgow, Scotland, India led a last-minute objection to language in a proposed joint statement around phasing out coal. Its chief delegate argued government fossil fuel subsidies to the public must continue  how else could India get fuel like natural gas to poor people who are still burning wood to cook their meals, he asked. That exchange highlights the contradiction at the heart of Indias stance on climate change  that Modis government can continue to set lofty goals, but when it comes to realizing them, his country is caught in a Catch-22 between development and decarbonization. Indias Power Minister Raj Kumar Singh demonstrated that dilemma in September when he announced plans to add 56 gigawatts of coal power to Indias energy mix by 2030 while also investing in renewable energy  emphasizing the need to prioritize reliable power for growth. Thats bad news for the global fight against climate change, where Indias actions have widespread ramifications. India emits over 2.4 billion tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) a year based on data collected by the EU. An analysis of its plans by the Climate Action Tracker show that the countrys goals are critically insufficient to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above levels before industrialization. Warming beyond that threshold will trigger irreversible damage and push many ecosystems to tipping points, climate science shows. As one of the worlds largest emitters, what India does is crucial for the world to meet the 1.5 C limit, said Hannah Fekete, co-founder of NewClimate Institute who has over a decade of experience quantifying the impact of policies on emissions. And nowhere are the contradictions in Indias stance clearer than in Rajasthan. The state is fast becoming a hotbed of solar energy, yet is also home to at least seven coal-fired power plants. Just 400 miles from the Bhadla Solar Park sit four of the worlds five most polluted cities, according to the 2021 World Air Quality Report. On any given day, they are blanketed in the grey soot and ash of burned coal. According to a report on Climate Change in the Indian Mind from Yale Universitys School of the Environment, 81% of Indians surveyed were worried about global warming, with 50% saying they were very worried. In addition, 64% say their government should be doing more to address global warming. Still, few would claim climate change is a problem for India alone to solve. Indeed, the picture changes substantially when its emissions are seen in the context of its massive population. Per capita figures show that Indian people actually contribute relatively very little to the problem. While the average American emits 14.7 tons of CO2 a year, an Indian person emits around 1.8. However, despite the low level of per capita emissions, the weight of the countrys struggles can be disproportionately felt on an individual level. In Delhi, the worlds fourth most polluted city, people are seeing first-hand the impacts of the countrys coal consumption. Resident Rohit Sharma, 36, told CNN, We are frustrated when we look at other cities where there is not much pollution and the lives that they are able to live but we cannot. The air pollution is going to impact everything, he added. We will have health issues, breathing issues and our life span will be cut short. His colleague Kunal Sharma, 28, worries about what life could look like in coming years. If no concrete action is taken, life after 10 years is going to become extremely difficult, Sharma said. What can we do? We have to live here. The Modi government has been encouraging Indians to live more sustainably  in October launching a program that urged drivers to turn off their engines at red traffic lights and for people to take the stairs instead of the lift. But the question isnt just whether the world can count on the Indian public to decarbonize  its also about whether Indians can count on their government to do so, too. Even as much of the world came to a standstill during the Covid-19 pandemic, India kept ramping up its renewables. Between 2019 and 2021, the share of Indias energy that comes from renewables increased by almost 3%, according to a 2022 report from the Centre for Science and Environment in New Delhi. India has had a sustained increase in renewable energy installation, Nandini Das, an energy research and policy analyst at the research institute Climate Analytics, told CNN. Even during Covid it hasnt stopped. At COP26, Modi outlined a series of targets for Indias efforts to combat climate change. He pledged that by 2030, India would have increased its non-fossil fuel energy capacity to 500 gigawatts  from 156.83 in 2021  and would be using renewable energy sources to meet 50% of its energy needs. Experts say India is on track to meet Modis non-fossil fuel target by increasing nuclear energy and hydropower, but the countrys shorter-term goals  such as having 175 gigawatts of renewable energy installed by the end of 2022, enough to power up to 131 million homes  hang in the balance. A report by S&P Global earlier this year said India may not meet its 2022 target, partly because the country still lacks a clear commitment to phasing out coal. Its also a question of funding  investing in renewable energy and other climate change mitigation efforts is expensive. The developed world was supposed to be providing $100 billion a year to developing nations to help them slash their emissions and adapt to the climate crisis. That goal has never been met. Its money India could use. To achieve just its wind and solar targets for 2030 would cost $223 billion, according to a BloombergNEF analysis. And in the 2019-2020 financial year, India raised only a quarter of the funds needed annually to meet its initial climate goals, according to a report published by Climate Policy Initiative (CPI), an independent, non-profit research group. If India doesnt receive the financial support it needs, maintaining its pace on developing renewable energy will be difficult. Increasing it will be even harder. In Rajasthan, projects like the Bhadla Solar Park have helped the state exceed its renewables goals, but experts say that success isnt happening widely enough. If India sticks to its current approach, which includes expanding coal-fired power generation and infrastructure to increasingly use imported LNG, it risks massive stranded assets in the fossil energy sector and an increased dependence on energy imports, Fekete, from the NewClimate Institute, told CNN. India should instead focus fully on renewable energy, with international support as needed. She says it if it doesnt, Indias greenhouse gas emissions are set to increase by 2030, which will make global targets even harder, if not impossible, to reach. Given the size of India, this puts the global temperature goal of 1.5C at risk, Fekete said.",08/11/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/11/07/india/india-climate-change-efforts-cop27-intl-hnk/index.html

New report paints dire picture of America? future as climate crisis accelerates,"Sometimes its helpful to state the obvious truth. And then restate it, again and again. Thats one of the benefits of the National Climate Assessment, a new draft of which was released this week ahead of President Joe Bidens trip to the UNs climate summit in Egypt. The federal report paints a dire picture of what life is now like in America amid the climate crisis, and the incredible changes in store in the future. And it outlines some painful truths about global warming we must confront, but so far have not. The COP27 climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, along with recent advances in US climate policy, may give the impression the world is doing something about an existential crisis, and were taking it seriously. The truth is, global emissions continue to rise, and will continue to do so for at least the next several years, even as scientists warn fossil fuel use must be slashed immediately. In the meantime, the reports authors write, the things Americans value most are at risk. The National Climate Assessment, which is a congressionally-mandated report the federal government releases every four or five years, summarizes all the latest science and research on climate change in the United States. The new draft, which will go through a long period of public review before it is officially published next year, provides vital context about the very real pain the climate crisis is causing in the United States today, and how far we are from creating a world safe for future generations. It is both familiar  as we have lived with these impacts for years now  and devastating to see it laid out in such stark synthesis. Here are the reports key takeaways: The world already has warmed a little more than 1 degree Celsius, according to the report, with the US warming faster than the global average. The goal of the Paris Agreement  which is being discussed this week in Egypt  is to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, or at most to 2 degrees Celsius. To do it, the US needs to reach net-zero carbon emissions by about 2050, which will require a total clean energy transformation, and will likely require technology to suck our previous planet-warming emissions back out of the atmosphere. For the United States to reach net-zero by 2050, the countrys emissions need to fall by a whopping 6% per year. US emissions fell just 12% over the course of nearly two decades between 2007 and 2019. The impacts of the climate crisis are already being felt throughout the United States today, and they will continue to get more intense as long as planet-warming emissions rise, which is code for as long as were burning fossil fuels for heat and electricity, and chopping down forests. Many extremes, including heatwaves, heavy precipitation, drought, flooding, wildfire, and tropical cyclones/hurricanes, are becoming more frequent and severe due to climate change, the reports authors write. And the disasters are costly, both in terms of lives and dollars. In the 1980s, the country experienced on average one (inflation-adjusted) billion-dollar [extreme weather] event every four months, the draft report states. Now, there is one every three weeks, on average. The climate crisis is creating a cycle of worsening inequality, one federal policies helped to create. The effects of climate change are felt most strongly by communities that are already overburdened, including Indigenous peoples, people of color, and low-income communities, the report says. These frontline communities experience harmful climate impacts first and worst, yet are often the least responsible for the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change ... Historical discriminatory policies such as redlining and displacement of Indigenous peoples forced communities of color into the least-valuable, often low-lying areas that are now more vulnerable to flooding, extreme heat, and air pollution from fossil fuel facilities and industry. The climate crisis cuts at the core of who we are as people. The things Americans value most are at risk, the report says. More intense extreme events and long-term climate changes make it harder to maintain safe homes and healthy families, reliable public services, a sustainable economy, thriving ecosystems, and strong communities. Many of the harmful impacts that people across the country are already experiencing will worsen as warming increases, and new risks will emerge. The rampant burning of fossil fuels is contributing to a worsening US water crisis. The report lays out how droughts will continue to become more intense and more frequent, most notably in the Southwest. Between 1980 and 2021, drought and related heatwaves across the country caused $291.1 billion (in 2021 dollars) in damages, the report notes. Recent droughts have strained surface and groundwater supplies, reduced agricultural productivity, and lowered water levels in major reservoirs, threatening hydropower generation. The reports authors highlight the threat to the countrys aquifers  massive reservoirs of underground water built up over thousands of years  which are particularly vulnerable to over-pumping. Climate change is bringing about a new era of forced migration, and millions of people are expected to be displaced in the United States. Factors leading to future migration within the US include wildfires in California, rising seas in Florida and more frequent flooding in the South, according to the report. The global economy is also in jeopardy. Global warming is expected to reduce midcentury global economic output by 11% to 14%, or about $23 trillion, according to the report. Keep the hard facts in mind as you hear President Biden and other world leaders discussing climate action at the COP27 climate summit and beyond. There is a 50-50 chance the world will at least temporarily hit 1.5 degrees in the next five years, according to a recent report by the World Meteorological Organization. To prevent it from happening, global leaders and private industry would need to move at the scale and intensity of the mobilization of resources for World War II, said Daniel Schrag, director of the Harvard University Center for the Environment. It doesnt mean its OK to throw up our hands. Its really important to realize that 1.5 (degrees of warming) was never safe and 2.2 (degrees) is not the end of the world, Schrag said. What I mean by that is there is no point where you throw up your hands and say, Oh, we lost! ... Its never time to give up.",11/11/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/11/11/us/national-climate-change-report-cop27/index.html
The biggest wild card in the climate crisis,"Negative emissions. Carbon capture. Net zero. It can be daunting, and a little exhausting, keeping up with the terminology from the annual UN climate talks, known as COP27, which are taking place in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. But CNNs coverage can help you understand whats at stake, what action needs to be taken and demystify the technical lingo. Plus, we take a deeper look at an overlooked driver of climate crisis: the thawing permafrost. I first became interested in permafrost  the layer of frozen ground beneath the Arctic tundra and high-latitude boreal forests  two years ago when reporting about mysterious holes that had suddenly appeared in remote parts of Siberia. The craters are perhaps the most extreme example of the dramatic changes happening in the northernmost reaches of the planet as polar regions warm four times faster than the global average. Permafrost is a particularly unpredictable wild card in the climate crisis. The carbon-storing frozen earth may already be emitting as much greenhouse gas as a country with a large carbon footprint, such as Japan. Scientists particularly fear abrupt thaw that is exposing deeper layers of permafrost and has the power to shock the landscape into releasing more carbon. Many are doing their best to minimize a personal role in climate change. But how about going green in death? Recompose, the first human composting company in the United States, has converted more than 200 corpses into soil and has more than 1,100 people signed up for its prearrangement program. Demand is likely to grow: California just became the fifth US state to sign a human composting bill into law, and others are considering similar legislation. Advocates hope it can help slow the climate crisis, with cremations requiring lots of fuel. Carbon emissions from cremating one corpse is the equivalent of driving 470 miles (756 kilometers) in a car, according to one estimate. However, the industry is still new, and there is little research on how much better human composting is for the environment compared with traditional burials.

Denmark is home to whats thought to be the worlds largest collection of brains  a cache of 9,479 of them. Its a valuable resource for brain research on conditions such as dementia and depression, but one with a dark and controversial history. The brains belonged to psychiatric patients in Denmark who died between 1945 and 1982 and did not consent to the organ donation. One of the specimens belonged to Kirsten Abildtrup, the great-aunt of journalist Lise Sgaard. Sgaard remembers a picture of Kirsten as a little girl on her grandmothers wall. No one ever spoke about the child in the photo. In a quest to understand what happened to her great-aunt, Sgaard discovered her relatives brain in the collection, now housed in a basement at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense. Kirsten had died at age 24 while being treated for schizophrenia after having a lobotomy a year earlier. By sharing her familys story last year in a Danish newspaper, Sgaard has sought to break some of the stigma surrounding mental illness. An expedition to the wreck of the Titanic has led to a surprising discovery. Divers encountered a rocky reef, made up of volcanic formations, and teeming with lobsters, deep-sea fish, sponges and several species of coral that could be thousands of years old. The location was earmarked for investigation after Titanic diver P.H. Nargeolet detected a sonar blip in 1996. The veteran submersible pilot initially had thought the anomaly, picked up on echo sounding equipment, might be another shipwreck. Meanwhile, explorers searching in the Atlantic Ocean for World War II artifacts uncovered debris from the Space Shuttle Challenger, which exploded shortly after takeoff in 1986. The oldest known sentence written in an alphabet has been found in an unexpected place  a lice comb. The 3,700-year-old ivory comb was unearthed in 2016 during a dig at an Israeli archaeological site called Lachish, but an inscription on the comb wasnt discovered until five years later. A smartphone snapshot revealed 17 letters that form seven words in Canaanite  the first known alphabet and the source of the one we use to write the English language in today. The comb is a wonderfully human portal into the past, and the inscription captures a sentiment familiar to anyone unlucky enough to have encountered the pesky critters. Make time for these remarkable reads:  An exciting medical breakthrough could soon make a difference for people with rare blood types, sickle cell disease or those with certain genetic disorders.

"Belching lakes, mystery craters, ?ombie fires? How the climate crisis is transforming the Arctic permafrost","Four years ago, Morris J. Alexie had to move out of the house his father built in Alaska in 1969 because it was sinking into the ground and water was beginning to seep into his home. The bogs are showing up in between houses, all over our community. There are currently seven houses that are occupied but very slanted and sinking into the ground as we speak, Alexie said by phone from Nunapitchuk, a village of around 600 people. Everywhere is bogging up. What was once grassy tundra is now riddled with water, he said. Their land is crisscrossed by 8-foot-wide boardwalks the community uses to get from place to place. And even some of the boardwalks have begun to sink. Its like little polka dots of tundra land. We used to have regular grass all over our community. Now its changed into constant water marsh. Thawing permafrost  the long-frozen layer of soil that has underpinned the Arctic tundra and boreal forests of Alaska, Canada and Russia for millennia  is upending the lives of people such as Alexie. Its also dramatically transforming the polar landscape, which is now peppered with massive sinkholes, newly formed or drained lakes, collapsing seashores and fire damage. Its not just the 3.6 million people who live in polar regions who need to be worried about the thawing permafrost. Everyone does  particularly the leaders and climate policymakers from nearly 200 countries now meeting in Egypt for COP 27, the annual UN climate summit. The vast amount of carbon stored in the northernmost reaches of our planet is an overlooked and underestimated driver of climate crisis. The frozen ground holds an estimated 1,700 billion metric tons of carbon  roughly 51 times the amount of carbon the world released as fossil fuel emissions in 2019, according to NASA. It may already be emitting as much greenhouse gas as Japan. Permafrost thaw gets less attention than the headline-hogging shrinking of glaciers and ice sheets, but scientists said that needs to change  and fast. Permafrost is like the dirty cousin to the ice sheets. Its a buried phenomenon. You dont see it. Its covered by vegetation and soil, said Merritt Turetsky, director of the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research at the University of Colorado Boulder. But its down there. We know its there. And it has an equally important impact on the global climate. Its particularly pressing because Russias invasion of Ukraine has stopped much scientific cooperation, meaning a potential loss of access to key data and knowledge about the region. Warmer summers  the Arctic is warming four times faster than the global average  have weakened and deepened the top or active layer of permafrost, which unfreezes in summer and freezes in winter. This thawing is waking up the microbes in the soil that feast on organic matter, allowing methane and carbon dioxide to escape from the soil and into the atmosphere. It can also open pathways for methane to rise up from reservoirs deep in the earth. Permafrost has been basically serving as Earths freezer for ancient biomass, Turetsky said. When those creatures and organisms died, their biomass became incorporated into these frozen soil layers and then was preserved over time. As permafrost thaws, often in complex ways that arent clearly understood, that freezer lid is cranking open, and scientists such as Turetsky are doubling efforts to understand how these changes will play out. Permafrost is a particularly unpredictable wild card in the climate crisis because its not yet clear whether carbon emissions from permafrost will be a relative drop in the bucket or a devastating addition. The latest estimates suggest that the magnitude of carbon emissions from permafrost by the end of this century could be equal to or bigger than present-day emissions from major fossil fuel-emitting nations. Theres some scientific uncertainty of how large that country is. However, if we go down a high emissions scenario, it could be as large or larger than the United States, said Brendan Rogers, an associate scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Massachusetts. He described the permafrost as a sleeping giant whose impact wasnt yet clear. Were just talking about a massive amount of carbon. We dont expect all of it to thaw ... because some of it is very deep and would take hundreds or thousands of years, Rogers said. But even if a small fraction of that does get admitted to the atmosphere, thats a big deal. Projections of cumulative permafrost carbon emissions from 2022 through 2100 range from 99 gigatons to 550 gigatons. By comparison, the United States currently emits 368 gigatons of carbon, according to a paper published in September in the journal Environmental Research Letters. Not all climate change models that policymakers use to make their already grim predictions include projected emissions from permafrost thaw, and those that do assume it will be gradual, Rogers said. He and other scientists are concerned about the prevalence of abrupt or rapid thawing in permafrost regions, which has the power to shock the landscape into releasing far more carbon than with gradual top-down warming alone. The traditional view of permafrost thaw is that its a process that exposes layers slowly, but abrupt thaw is exposing deep permafrost layers more quickly in a number of ways. For example, Big Trail Lake in Alaska, a recently formed lake, belches bubbles of methane  a potent greenhouse gas, which comes from thawing permafrost below the lake water. The methane can stop such lakes from refreezing in winter, exposing the deeper permafrost to warmer temperatures and degradation. Rapid thawing of the permafrost also happens in the wake of intense wildfires that have swept across parts of Siberia in recent years, Rogers said. Sometimes these blazes smolder underground for months, long after flames above ground have been extinguished, earning them the nickname zombie fires. The fires themselves will burn part of the active layer (of permafrost) combusting the soil and releasing greenhouses gases like carbon dioxide, Rogers said. But that soil thats been combusted was also insulating, keeping the permafrost cool in summer. Once you get rid of it, you get very quickly much deeper active layers, and that can lead to larger emissions over the following decades. Also deeply concerning has been the sudden appearance of around 20 perfectly cylindrical craters in the remote far north of Siberia in the past 10 years. Dozens of meters in diameter, they are thought to be caused by a buildup and explosion of methane  a previously unknown geological phenomenon that surprised many permafrost scientists and could represent a new pathway for methane previously contained deep within the earth to escape. The Arctic is warming so fast, Rogers said, and theres crazy things happening. A lack of monitoring and data on the behavior of permafrost, which covers 15% of the exposed land surface of the Northern Hemisphere, means scientists still only have a patchwork, localized understanding of rapid thaw, how it contributes to global warming and affects people living in permafrost regions. Rogers at the Woodwell Climate Research Center is part of a new $41 million initiative, funded by a group of billionaires and called the Audacious Project, to understand permafrost thaw. It aims to coordinate a pan-Arctic carbon monitoring network to fill in some of the data gaps that have made it difficult to incorporate permafrost thaw emissions into climate targets. The projects first carbon flux tower, which tracks the flow of methane and carbon dioxide from the ground to the atmosphere, was installed this summer in Churchill, Manitoba. However, plans to install similar monitoring stations in Siberia are in disarray as a result of Russias invasion of Ukraine. Its always been more challenging to work in Russia than other countries ... Canada, for example, Rogers said. But this (invasion), of course, has made it exponentially more challenging. Sebastian Dotterl, a professor and soil scientist at ETH Zurich, a Swiss university, who studies how warmer air and soil temperatures change plant growth in the Arctic, was able to travel to the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard in the Arctic this summer to collect soil and plant samples. However, the field trip cost twice as much as initially budgeted because the group was forbidden to use any Russia-owned infrastructure, forcing the team to hire a tourist boat and reorganize its itinerary. But Dotterl said the more pressing issue is that he can no longer interact with his counterparts at Russian institutions. We are now splitting a rather small community of specialists all over the world into political groups that are disconnected, where our problems are global and should be connected, he said. Turetsky agreed, saying that the war in Ukraine had been a disaster for our scientific enterprise. Russia and Siberia are huge, huge players. ... Many of the (European Union-) and US-funded projects to work in Siberia to do any kind of lateral knowledge sharing, theyve all been canceled. Will we stop trying? No, of course not. And theres a lot we can do with existing data and with global remote sensing products. But its been a real setback for the community.",12/11/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/11/12/world/permafrost-climate-change-explainer-scn/index.html
Saving water can help us deal with the climate crisis. Here? how to reduce your use,"The reliability of our faucets providing water every time we turn them on can make water seem like a magical, never-ending resource. But abusing the availability of this finite resource can contribute to water scarcity and harm our capacity to deal with the impact of the climate crisis. Four billion people today already live in places that are affected by water scarcity at least part of the year, said Rick Hogeboom, executive director of the Water Footprint Network, an international knowledge center based in the Netherlands. Climate change will have a worsening influence on the demand-supply balance, he said. If all people were to conserve water in some way, that would help ease some of the immediate impacts seen from the climate crisis, said Shanika Whitehurst, associate director of sustainability for Consumer Reports research and testing. Consumer Reports is a nonprofit that helps consumers evaluate goods and services. Unfortunately, there has been a great toll taken on our surface and groundwater sources, so conservation efforts would more than likely have to be employed long term for there to be a more substantial effect. Yes, businesses and governments should play a part in water conservation by, respectively, producing goods water efficiently and allocating water in a sustainable, equitable way, Hogeboom said. But addressing the multifaceted water crises is a shared responsibility. No one actor can solve it, nor is there a silver bullet, he added. We need all actors to play their part. Contrary to what you might think, the water used directly in and around the home makes up a minor portion of the total water footprint of a consumer, Hogeboom said. The bulk  typically at least 95%  is indirect water use, water use that is hidden in the products we buy, the clothes we wear and the food we eat, Hogeboom said. Cotton, for instance, is a very thirsty crop. Of the 300-plus gallons of water the average American family uses every day at home, however, roughly 70% of this use occurs indoors, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency  making the home another important place to start cutting your use. Here are some ways to reduce your water footprint as you move from room to room and outdoors. Since the kitchen involves dishwashing, cooking and one of the biggest water guzzlers  your diet  its a good place to start. An old kitchen faucet can release 1 to 3 gallons of water per minute when running at full blast, according to Consumer Reports. Instead of rinsing dishes before putting them in the dishwasher, scrape food into your trash or compost bin. Make sure your dishwasher is fully loaded so you only do as many wash cycles as necessary and make the most use of the water. With some activities you can save water by not only using less but also upgrading the appliances that deliver the water. Dishwashers certified by Energy Star, the government-backed symbol for energy efficiency, are about 15% more water-efficient than standard models, according to Consumer Reports. If you do wash dishes by hand, plug up the sink or use a wash basin so you can use a limited amount of water instead of letting the tap run. If you plan on eating frozen foods, thaw them in the fridge overnight instead of running water over them. For drinking, keep a pitcher of water in the fridge instead of running the faucet until the waters cool  and if you need to do that to get hot water, collect the cold water and use it to water plants. Cook foods in as little water as possible, which can also retain flavor, according to the University of Toronto Scarboroughs department of physical and environmental sciences. When it comes to saving water via what you eat, generally animal products are more water-intensive than plant-based alternatives, Hogeboom said. Go vegetarian or even better vegan, he added. If you insist on meat, replace red meat by pig or chicken, which has a lower water footprint than beef. It takes more than 1,800 gallons of water to produce 1 pound of beef, Consumer Reports Whitehurst said. The bathroom is the largest consumer of indoor water, as the toilet alone can use 27% of household water, according to the EPA. You can cut use here by following this adage: If its yellow, let it mellow. If its brown, flush it down. Limiting the amount of toilet flushes  as long as it is urine  is not problematic for hygiene, Whitehurst said. However, you do have to watch the amount of toilet paper to avoid clogging your pipes. If there is solid waste or feces, then flush the toilet immediately to avoid unsanitary conditions. Older toilets use between 3.5 and 7 gallons of water per flush, but WaterSense-labeled toilets use up to 60% less. WaterSense is a partnership program sponsored by the EPA. Theres probably more to gain by having dual flush systems so you dont waste gallons for small flushes, Hogeboom said. By turning off the sink tap when you brush your teeth, shave or wash your face, you can save more than 200 gallons of water monthly, according to the EPA. Cut water use further by limiting showers to five minutes and eliminating baths. Shower with your partner when you can. Save even more water by turning it off when youre shampooing, shaving or lathering up, Consumer Reports suggests. Replacing old sink faucets or showerheads with WaterSense models can save hundreds of gallons of water per year. Laundry rooms account for nearly a fourth of household water use, according to the EPA. Traditional washing machines can use 50 gallons of water or more per load, but newer energy- and water-conserving machines use less than 27 gallons per load. You can also cut back by doing full loads (but not overstuffing) and choosing the appropriate water level and soil settings. Doing the latter two can help high-efficiency machines use only the water thats needed. If you have a high-efficiency machine, use HE detergent or measure out regular detergent, which is more sudsy and, if too much is used, can cause the machine to use more water, according to Consumer Reports. Nationally, outdoor water use accounts for 30% of household use, according to the EPA. This percentage can be much higher in drier parts of the country and in more water-intensive landscapes, particularly in the West. If you prefer to have a landscape, reduce your outdoor use by planting only plants appropriate for your climate or ones that are low-water and drought-resistant. If maintained properly, climate-appropriate landscaping can use less than one-half the water of a traditional landscape, the EPA says. The biggest water consumers outside are automatic irrigation systems, according to the EPA. To use only whats necessary, adjust irrigation controllers at least once per month to account for weather changes. WaterSense irrigation controllers monitor weather and landscape conditions to water plants only when needed.",16/11/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/11/16/world/ways-to-save-water-climate-environmental-benefits-wellness-scn-lbg/index.html
"Opinion: To help fight the climate crisis, we should plant more trees","When we joined with countries, companies and NGOs two years ago to launch the global partnership 1t.org, we knew it would not be a panacea for climate change. Leaders across the forest-climate movement, including ourselves, have always made clear that the most important step we must take to fight climate change is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In recent months, despite the deadly fires, floods, heat and drought fueled by climate change, a steady stream of criticism has been aimed at the flourishing global movement to use trees as a response to the climate crisis. Some critics have warned against pretending that planting trees is a permanent climate solution, concerned that reliance on trees will slacken other climate efforts. Others have worried that planting the wrong trees will lead to forests that are less resilient and less biologically diverse. But we believe it would be a profound mistake to ignore or diminish the indispensable role that protecting and growing trees can play in addressing climate change. In the United States, for example, our forests captured approximately 13% of gross US greenhouse gas emissions in 2020. In addition to protecting our existing forests, there are millions of acres across America where we can plant and grow more trees, such as reforesting burned areas and planting trees in urban areas. And we know that our efforts must lead to biologically diverse forests, and only in ecosystems where trees belong. Thats why we and our partners adhere to best practices such as the 10 golden rules for restoring forests. The private sector has a particularly large role to play here. Companies can bring invaluable resources, skills and technologies to bear in a responsible and science-based manner, for both the forest movement and the broader fight against the climate crisis. Heres how: There must be zero tolerance for greenwashing, where a company might exaggerate or falsify the actual climate change impact of its investment in natural climate solutions. Businesses must practice transparency through rigorous public reporting, and by using technologies that enable stakeholders to see exactly what their investments are accomplishing. Stakeholders ability to see and verify climate investments can hold businesses accountable and push them to invest in truly rigorous, credible projects. Investing in nature-based solutions like trees cannot be an excuse for companies to continue emitting dangerous levels of greenhouse gasses. Companies that commit to net zero should pair their investments in carbon removal efforts, such as reforestation, with changes to their operations that will reduce actual emissions. Salesforce, for example, is supporting the conservation, restoration and growth of 100 million trees by 2030, while prioritizing emissions reductions and reaching 100% renewable energy for its global operations last year. For any emissions that remain after that, Salesforce is using carbon credits to have net zero residual emissions today. And PepsiCo is adopting more energy-efficient manufacturing processes and shifting to renewable electricity, while also investing in natural climate solutions such as forest conservation and restoration. Companies can go beyond just paying for tree seedlings to help deliver forest-climate solutions with rigor and innovation. They should look at ways they can contribute from their unique areas of expertise. Technology companies, for instance, can donate products and pro-bono services to help partner organizations better utilize forest and climate data. Companies should also use their direct financial contributions to help partners with fewer resources develop and execute projects. This includes partner expenses for things like designing climate-resilient plantings and training workers to implement these cutting-edge forestry approaches. We welcome the ongoing debate about the best way to achieve our climate goals. But as we move forward, lets not dismiss climate solutions  including natural ones, like trees. Thats how we can sustain the climate momentum we have worked for so many decades to build, engage more people and communities in this urgent work and spare the world the worst effects of climate change. That cant be just the work of governments and environmentalists. It has to be the business of business.",16/11/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/11/16/opinions/climate-crisis-tree-planting-daley-benioff/index.html
How the climate crisis may be changing the way tornadoes behave,"Among the cocktail of extreme weather events that plow through the United States, tornadoes can be the most destructive and the most deadly especially for those unprepared for whats to come. As severe weather events intensify, occur more often and exacerbate the countrys growing economic toll, science is running to keep up to answer emerging questions of whether climate change is worsening every single disaster. But unlike heat waves, floods and hurricanes, scientific research about the connection between the climate crisis and tornadoes has not been as easy to make; though climate researchers say uncertainty doesnt mean it is unlikely, and experts are already seeing changes in how recent tornado outbreaks are behaving. When a series of twisters uprooted trees, tore down infrastructure and killed dozens of people in Kentucky in December 2021, for instance, meteorologists and climate scientists  careful not to attribute the cause to climate change  underscored the historic nature of the tornadic outbreak. Whats clear, experts say, is that these weather events, no matter how severe, are occurring against the backdrop of human-caused climate change; it just all comes down to discerning how a warming planet is altering weather patterns, including geographical location and frequency, as well as severity. Scientists say the short-lived scale of tornadoes, coupled with an extremely inconsistent and unreliable historical record, makes connecting outbreaks to long-term, human-caused climate change extremely tough. Victor Gensini, a professor at Northern Illinois University and one of the top tornado experts, described the 2021 Kentucky outbreak as one of the most remarkable in US history  and while climate change may have played a part in its violent behavior, its not yet clear what that role was. That same sentiment can be said with the most recent devastating outbreaks. Think of a pair of dice, he said. On one die, you altered the value of five to six, which means it now has two sixes  raising the chances of you rolling the pair of dice and getting the value 12. Although you cant immediately attribute that value of 12 to the change you made, you just altered the probability of that event occurring. Gensini said thats similar to how the climate system now works  the more humans pump greenhouse gases like fossil fuel emissions into the atmosphere and change the system, the chances of extreme weather events occurring, intensifying, and changing the traditional location and patterns will amplify. When you start putting a lot of these events together, and you start looking at them in the aggregate sense, the statistics are pretty clear that not only has there sort of been a change  a shift, if you will  of where the greatest tornado frequency is happening, Gensini previously told CNN. But these events are becoming perhaps stronger, more frequent and also more variable. Todd Moore, associate professor and chair of the department of geosciences at Fort Hays State University, said that over the last few decades tornado frequency has increased in vast swaths of the southern Midwest and Southeast, while decreasing in parts of the central and southern Great Plains, a region traditionally known as Tornado Alley. A study he authored in 2019 indicated that the changing climate, among other factors, could be contributing to this eastward shift in Tornado Alley, resulting in more tornadoes occurring in the more heavily populated states east of the Mississippi River. Moore points to different ingredients that may have led to this shift such as humidity, instability, and a strong wind shear. His study also found that tornadoes are clustering on fewer days in the year and that days with little tornado activity are becoming less common, with outbreaks becoming more frequent during the fall and winter seasons. Climatologists are currently trying to determine why these trends are occurring, Moore told CNN. Tornadoes take shape under particularly specific atmospheric conditions, but are primarily fueled by warm, moist air from strong winds that shift direction with altitude. Scientists have warned that the rise in greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere is drastically changing the climate system, causing the jet stream  fast-flowing air currents in the upper atmosphere that influence day-to-day weather  to behave oddly. An explanation for increased concentration of tornadoes is tenuous, Moore said. One hypothesis is that a wavier jet stream is providing more environments favorable for tornado outbreaks, so their likelihood of occurrence is increasing. But the offset is that its also likely a tornado outbreak was simply triggered by natural forces at play, against the background of climate change. The World Weather Attribution, a group of the worlds leading scientists that establishes the link between climate and weather, for instance, previously concluded that climate change played little to no role in intensifying the flooding that killed 138 people in Vietnam in 2020. Its also very common when you have La Nina in place to see this eastward shift in highest tornado frequency, Gensini said. But if you look at the past 40 years, the research Ive done ... has shown that places like Nashville, Tennessee, for example, or Mayfield, Kentucky ... their frequency of tornadoes, their risk of having a tornado has increased over the last 40 years. This is backed by a 2021 report from the World Meteorological Organization that found an extreme weather event or climate disaster has occurred every day, on average, somewhere in the world over the last 50 years, marking a five-fold increase over that period and exacting an economic toll that has climbed seven-fold since the 1970s. As the climate crisis accelerates and further research continues to establish its connection with tornadoes, more people will be vulnerable to the most severe consequences of extreme weather events. And experts say cities shouldnt put off adaptation plans any longer, and that they should use available climate research and treat them as part of the larger emergency response system. Gensini said climate change or not, these types of tornado disasters will continue to worsen as humans alter the landscape and build larger, more sprawling cities. We have more assets and more targets for the severe storms to hit, he said. So even if you take climate change out of the equation, which is very likely to make the problem worse, we still have this issue of human and societal vulnerability.",14/12/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/12/14/us/climate-change-affecting-tornadoes-xpn/index.html
"Whales can have an important but overlooked role in tackling the climate crisis, researchers say","The worlds largest whales are more than just astonishing creatures. Much like the ocean, soil and forests, whales can help save humanity from the accelerating climate crisis by sequestering and storing planet-heating carbon emissions, researchers say. In a paper published Thursday in the journal Trends in Ecology & Evolution, climate researchers suggest that whales are important, but often overlooked, carbon sinks. The enormous size of these marine mammals, which can reach 150 tons, means they can store carbon much more effectively than smaller animals. And because whales live longer than most animals, some for more than 100 years, the paper said they could be one of the largest stable living carbon pools in the ocean. Even when they die, whale carcasses descend to the deepest parts of the sea and settle on the seafloor, trapping the carbon theyve stored in their stout, protein-rich bodies. An indirect way whales can be critical carbon sinks is through their feces. Whale poop is rich in nutrients which can be taken up by phytoplankton  tiny organisms that suck up carbon dioxide as they grow. When they die, phytoplankton also sink at the bottom of the seafloor, taking tiny bits of carbon in their carcasses. The process of carbon sequestration helps mitigate climate change, because it locks away carbon that otherwise would have warmed the planet somewhere else for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. Yet whales are threatened, with six out of 13 great whale species classified as endangered or vulnerable due to threats including industrial whaling, which has reduced whale biomass by 81%, as well as entanglement with fishing gear, climate change-induced shifts in prey availability, noise pollution and more. Heidi Pearson, lead author and researcher at the University of Alaska Southeast, said the research shows that protecting whales has a double benefit  helping to stem the biodiversity crisis as well as human-caused climate change. The paper puts together all available research about how whales work as critical carbon sinks. As the need grows for nature-based solutions such as tree planting to help solve the climate crisis, Pearson said it is important to understand the ability of whales to trap carbon. You can think of protecting whales as a low risk and low regret strategy, because theres really no downside, Pearson told CNN. What if we protect them and get ecosystem benefits in addition to carbon? She said there was no risk to this strategy compared to other untested, expensive solutions to capturing and trapping carbon, such as geoengineering. There has been much research and analysis into whales contribution to carbon storage over the years. In 2019, economists with the International Monetary Fund attempted to quantify the economic benefits of whales. The first-of-its-kind analysis looked at the market price of carbon dioxide, then calculated the whales total monetary value based on how much carbon it captures, in addition to other economic benefits like ecotourism. It put the average value of a great whale at $2 million. But there remain big gaps in knowledge to fully determine how whale carbon should be used in climate mitigation policies. Asha de Vos, a marine biologist and founder of Oceanswell in Sri Lanka, said its important to recognize that whales have more to offer than their beauty and charisma, and that protecting them is key to a proper functioning ocean ecosystem. But, as the authors suggest, we mustnt overemphasize the role of whales in these spaces as we do not have sufficient research, de Vos, who is not involved with the study, told CNN. Fundamentally, whales will not save our oceans or planet on their own, but they likely play a role in the larger system. As Pearson continues to research whale carbon in Alaska, particularly delving into the indirect pathways in which whales can be carbon sinks, she said she hopes the current paper pushes policymakers to consider whales as a significant part of climate mitigation strategies. Its another layer that links the biodiversity crisis to the climate crisis  but for now, Pearson said she and a team will go back out in the field to fully quantify the carbon impact of whales. Whales arent a silver bullet to saving the planet; its just one small thing that we could do amidst many other things we need to do for climate change, Pearson said. We just need to get the scientific story straight.",15/12/2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/12/15/world/whales-carbon-sinks-climate-change-scn/index.html
? world rapidly warming? The past eight years were the eight warmest on record for planet,"The last eight years have been the eight warmest on record as the growing concentration of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere pushes global temperatures toward a dangerous tipping point, a new report shows. An analysis by the European Unions Copernicus Climate Change Service published on Tuesday said that 2022 was the fifth-warmest year for the planet since records began. It also reported Europe recorded its warmest summer last year and its second warmest year overall, exceeded only by 2020. Copernicus described 2022 as a year of climate extremes that brought record-breaking heatwaves in Europe, deadly floods in Pakistan, extreme widespread flooding in Australia, and that saw the Antarctic Sea reach its lowest minimum extent on record. The report said that annual average temperature reached 1.2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, marking the eighth year in a row of temperatures at least 1 degree above the 1850 to 1900 reference period. Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, most countries agreed to limit warming to well below 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels, but preferably to 1.5 degrees. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) identified the 1.5-degree mark as a key threshold and said breaching it would dramatically increase the risk of extreme weather events and irreversible changes. Svitlana Krakovska, who heads the Ukrainian delegation to the IPCC, has an analogy for anyone wondering what difference a few degrees of warming could make. Your normal body temperature is 36.6. Now we have plus [1.2] degrees and we are already sick. And if we will have 1.5, or 2, look at the difference. We cannot allow this, she told CNN at the COP27 climate conference in Egypt in November. Every bit of warming matters, she said. The Copernicus report also highlighted the rising atmospheric concentration of CO2 and methane, potent greenhouse gasses that trap heat in the atmosphere and warm the planet. Before humans started to burn large quantities of fossil fuels, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere was around 280 parts per million. According to Copernicus, it hit an annual average of 417 parts per million in 2022, an increase of 2.1 parts per million compared to 2021. Records show the concentration of carbon in the atmosphere has not been this high in around 2 million years, Copernicus added. The IPCC has said that the world needs to cut greenhouse gas emissions nearly in half by 2030 and achieve net zero by 2050 to have any chance of keeping global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Scientists say the link between the greenhouse gasses concentrations and the rising temperatures is unmistakable. The tumbling of temperature records combined with the unprecedented heatwaves, droughts and intense rainfall and flooding events across the planet, along with the sustained global warmth over the past decade, are all entirely consistent with a world rapidly warming, Richard Allan, professor in climate science at the University of Reading, told CNN in an email. Allan said this is happening because of the additional heating effect of the greenhouse gases were collectively pumping out into the atmosphere. Scientists said 2022 was an exceptionally warm year despite the La Nina phenomenon, which has now been observed for three consecutive years and which normally leads to cooler global average temperatures. It is very likely that the recent La Ninas have been masking some of the warming from global climate change, said Marybeth Arcodia, a postdoctoral researcher at Colorado State University. She added that because El Nino  the opposite phase of La Nina  tends to cause higher than average temperatures, it is probable that when the next El Nino occurs, the global average temperature will be higher than what we have been seeing in the past few years. The Copernicus report comes just days after the UK Met Office announced that 2022 was the UKs hottest year on record, with an average temperature of over 10 degrees Celsius recorded for the first time. In a report released last week, the Met Office said that human-induced climate change has made the record-breaking annual temperature around 160 times more likely. Its scientists calculated that what would normally be around one in 500 year annual temperature is now likely every three to four years because of climate change. Meteo-France, the French national meteorological service, said Friday that 2022 was the hottest year in mainland France since records began in 1900, adding that eight of the warmest 10 years on record occurred since 2010. It said the extreme heat France experienced in 2022 was a clear sign of climate change and that similar temperatures could become the norm by mid-century. Italys Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Sciences said 2022 was the hottest year on record for Italy, while the German National Meteorological Service said 2022 was at least tied for the hottest year on record with 2018, and could surpass 2018 once final data is analyzed this month.",10/01/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/01/10/world/eight-warmest-years-climate-copernicus-intl/index.html
"Exxon accurately predicted global warming from 1970s ?but continued to cast doubt on climate science, new report finds","ExxonMobils own scientists accurately predicted future global warming in reports dating back to the late 1970s and early 1980s, despite the company publicly continuing for years to cast doubt on climate science and lobby against climate action, according to a new analysis. Researchers examined climate projections produced between 1977 and 2003 by Exxon, one of the worlds biggest oil and gas companies. They found the companys science was not only good enough to predict long term temperature rise, but also accurately predicted when human-caused climate change would become discernible, according to the report published Thursday in the journal Science. A slew of internal Exxon documents unearthed by researchers and journalists over the past few years have shown that the company was aware of the link between fossil fuels and climate change at least as far back as the 1970s. But until now, there hasnt been an in-depth review of Exxons own climate modeling data, said Geoffrey Supran, a research fellow in the history of science at Harvard University and a co-author of the report. This is the first-ever systematic assessment of the fossil fuel industrys climate projections, Supran told CNN. The researchers analyzed more than 100 reports by Exxon scientists, produced between 1977 and 2014. They then whittled these down to 12 documents containing climate projections and compared them against historical observations. Between 63% to 83% of the projections were accurate in predicting subsequent global warming and their projections were also consistent with independent academic models, the report found. The companys climate modeling showed shocking skill and accuracy, Supran said. Exxon projected an average warming of around 0.2 degrees Celsius per decade, according to the report. That allows us for the first time to put a number on what Exxon knew, namely that fossil fuel burning was going to hit the planet by 0.2 degrees Celsius per decade, Supran said. Exxon was on the money on various other topics, said Supran, including accurately predicting that human-caused climate change would be first detectable around the year 2000, as well as estimating how much CO2 would lead to dangerous warming. I see this as Exxon knew 2.0, Supran said, referring to the #ExxonKnew campaign launched by climate activists in the wake of earlier revelations that Exxon has long known about the link between its products and climate change. We now have tight, unimpeachable evidence that ExxonMobil accurately predicted global warming years before it turned around and publicly attacked climate science, Supran said. Todd Spitler, a spokesperson for Exxon, said in a statement that ExxonMobil is committed to being part of the solution to climate change and the risks it poses, and those who talk about how Exxon knew are wrong. Addressing Exxons climate research, Spitler said the company has produced nearly 150 papers, including more than 50 peer-reviewed publications that the Company has made available to the public. ExxonMobils understanding of climate science has developed along with that of the broader scientific community, he said. Despite its own modeling showing fossil fuel use would lead to global warming, Exxons public communications raised doubt about climate change, including taking out ads in major publications suggesting climate science was poorly understood and scientists were divided. When the company was making these claims about doubt and uncertainty through at least the early 2010s, they were doing so in full awareness that their own science contradicted those claims, Supran said. A 2017 peer-reviewed study, which Supran co-authored, examined nearly 190 public and private communications from the company and found that while the majority of internal documents acknowledged human-caused global warming, most of its public statements expressed doubt. Exxon rejected these findings at the time as inaccurate and preposterous. In 2021, a then Exxon lobbyist, Keith McCoy, was captured on an undercover video appearing to confirm that the company sought to undermine climate action. Did we aggressively fight against some of the science? Yes, McCoy said in the video, filmed by Unearthed, Greenpeace UKs investigative journalism arm. Exxon condemned McCoys statements at the time, saying that they did not reflect the companys position on climate. The company, which made a record $58 billion in profits in 2022 according to preliminary data, has since expressed a commitment to the Paris climate agreement pledge to keep global temperature from rising more than 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels. It has also committed to reach net-zero emissions for its operated assets by 2050  meaning it will remove from the atmosphere at least as much planet-warming pollution as its operations emit. ExxonMobil is actively engaged in efforts to reduce emissions while providing affordable energy to the communities that need it, Spitler said. Exxon was one of the companies highlighted in a year-long investigation in the US by the Democratic-led House Oversight Committee into climate disinformation from fossil fuel companies, published in December. It found that the industry is posturing on climate issues while avoiding real commitments. At the time, Spitler issued a statement saying the committee took internal Exxon communications out of context, saying they represented well intended, internal policy debates. The reports findings could potentially help support climate litigation against Exxon, Daniel Farber, professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley, told CNN. (According to the studys disclosures, one of the authors had previously served as a paid consultant to a law firm that has filed legal complaints against Exxon and other fossil fuel companies, though that law firm played no role in this or any other study by the authors, including in their funding.) Cities, counties and states across the United States have filed lawsuits against fossil fuel companies, including Exxon, accusing them of deceiving the public about their role in accelerating climate change. Exxon has said these lawsuits have no merit. The more we learn about industry deception, the stronger the legal claims will be, he said. Thursdays analysis could also alter public perceptions of the company, Farber said: Over time the companys image may erode as the stream of disclosures eats away at its reputation. This story has been updated to note the studys competing interests disclosure.",12/01/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/01/12/business/exxon-climate-models-global-warming/index.html
"Opinion: Finally, good news that inspires some hope for climate change","If you watch the news today, youd be forgiven for thinking that we live in dark times. Impending climate change, overpopulation, political discord, conflict in Ukraine and threats of nuclear war all paint a bleak picture. But this week delivered some refreshingly good news: The World Meteorological Organization released a very hopeful report stating that humanity and all life on Earth dodged a bullet. The Montreal Protocol, an international agreement signed in 1987, regulated the consumption and production of almost 100 chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) that created a hole in the ozone layer and endangered the planets entire ecosystem. More than three decades later, the use of CFCs has decreased by 99%, and the Earths ozone layer is on track to recover in the coming decades. This success gives some of us hope that we might employ a similar approach to mitigate todays very pressing danger arising from climate change. In 1974, chemists Frank Rowland and Mario Molina found that carelessly recycled refrigerators and ordinary hair spray posed an existential threat to life on Earth. The coolant in refrigerators and the propellant in spray cans were made of CFCs that, when mixed in air, rose to the very top of the atmosphere. There, the CFCs underwent chemical interactions that destroyed the ozone. The layer of ozone gas high above the Earths surface acts as a shield against the most dangerous forms of ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun. UV radiation can be deadly to life  humans use it to sterilize water, kill unwanted pathogens in hospital operating rooms, and sanitize everything from toothbrushes to cell phones. If the ozone were to disappear, dangerous solar ultraviolet light would make it to the Earths surface. In humans and animals, it would cause melanoma and cataracts. In plants, it would affect the ability to grow and produce fruits and vegetables. Perhaps most dangerously, it would kill phytoplankton in the ocean. Given that phytoplankton is the foundation of marine food chains, much of the life in the ocean would also die. In the face of this threat, the international community took notice and, in 1987, signed the Montreal Protocol. The protocol, which established practical targets, regulated both the production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances, gave states flexibility in how they would meet those goals and created a fund that provided financial and technical support for developing countries to comply with the agreement. Since then, scientists have been monitoring the size of the ozone hole, which is shrinking. The success of the Montreal Protocol shows that world leaders can address global, existential problems by working together toward a common goal. CFCs, of course, are not the only way humans have endangered the Earths ecosystems. Indeed, the emission of carbon dioxide now poses a much greater danger. By burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas, humans are pumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere at a rate of over 35 billion tons per year. The increase in carbon dioxide concentration over the past few decades has raised it to levels not seen over the past million years. Carbon dioxide is called a greenhouse gas, because it acts like a greenhouse, trapping heat under it. This causes the surface of the Earth to heat up, leading to changes in the climate. Previously habitable places become drier or wetter. A hotter Earth leads to glaciers melting, rising sea levels and the flooding of low-lying coastal areas. Island nations like Kiribati could disappear altogether. These disruptive climate changes are having a significant impact on humanity, including droughts in the American West, with rampant wildfires and emptying reservoirs. More heat in the atmosphere is also causing more intense and destructive hurricanes, with attendant damage to houses and businesses. Carbon emissions are not due to any one nation. While historically the main emitter was the US, today it is China, with the US, the European Union, India, Russia and Japan being other leaders in this unwelcome ranking. No one country can fix this problem. What is needed is international negotiation and agreement to move humanity to other sources of energy beyond fossil fuels. Certainly, the governments of the world have tried. In 2015, nearly 200 nations signed an accord signed in Paris, agreeing in principle to address the carbon dioxide emission problem. Under President Donald Trump, the US withdrew from the pact in 2020, although it rejoined in 2021 when President Joe Biden took office. However, speed bumps like these should not deter the nations of the world. We know the problem and we have shown that we can cooperate when there is an existential threat to civilization. The example of successful CFC mitigation provides a blueprint  at least in spirit  for humanity to work together for the better of us all. Carbon dioxide is an enormous danger to humanity and civilization. It is an international problem, requiring an international solution, and the success of the agreement banning CFCs gives us some hope that humanity will once again rise to the occasion.",13/01/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/01/13/opinions/ozone-layer-hope-for-climate-change-lincoln/index.html
These 3 solutions could turn the tide on the climate crisis,"Climate change is sending the world hurtling towards a series of catastrophic tipping points, which risk setting off feedback loops that lock the world into irreversible climate change. Thats the bad news. The good news, however, is that there is also a series of positive tipping points, according to an analysis published Thursday by researchers from an international group of institutions including the University of Exeter and the World Resources Institutes Systems Change Lab, with support from the Bezos Earth Fund. These are defined as small climate actions that could have a snowball effect, prompting emissions cuts across some of most polluting sectors of the global economy. The theory goes like this: As new technologies start to outpace older, more polluting versions, reinforcing feedback loops kick in that help a technology to improve, get cheaper and become more accessible. The idea is to create self-propelling change, Tim Lenton, Chair in Climate Change and Earth System Science at the University of Exeter and a report author, told CNN. The report authors acknowledge that triggering these tipping points alone will not be enough to meet global climate objectives. But as time runs out to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, targeted action can be a powerful lever, they say. In the face of an otherwise enormous climate and ecological crisis... maybe we can be part of change that will happen faster than we think, Lenton said. The report identifies three super-leverage points: Relatively low-cost or low-difficulty interventions that could have the biggest impacts in decarbonizing the global economy. A tipping point is already very close for electric vehicles, the report says. EVs made up 10% of all cars sold last year, driven by sales in China and Europe. To be on track for a net-zero fleet by 2050, EVs must account for around 60% of new passenger car sales by 2060, according to the report, which says mandates for EV sales could be a particularly powerful policy to bring forward a tipping point. As demand ramps up, costs of production go down, including for lithium batteries, which have seen costs fall by 90% over the last 10 years, according to the report. EVs overtaking gas-powered cars could also have positive spillover benefits for other sectors requiring battery storage, such as wind and solar. Electrifying cars means a tipping point for ever cheaper batteries, and cheaper batteries could be a really valuable, cheap source of storage of electricity to enable the transition to renewable power, said Lenton. Meat has a huge climate impact. Livestock farming accounts for 14.5% of human-caused, planet-warming emissions. Plant-based proteins  things like beans, lentils, peas and nuts  produce up to 90% fewer emissions than meat. They are also catching up with meat in terms of cost, as well as flavor. But they currently have a low market share. If public institutions such as schools, hospitals and governments used their purchasing power to buy plant-based proteins instead of meat, this could be a powerful lever to increase uptake of these products, the report authors said. This policy change could also help shift social norms around plant-based products and increase their appeal, Lenton said. Moving away from animal products would have the added advantages of cutting farming emissions, freeing up land to support wildlife and carbon storage, and reducing incentives for deforestation. Ramping up the production of green fertilizer could not only slash emissions from the production of agricultural fertilizer, but also help kickstart a green hydrogen economy, according to the report. Ammonia, a key ingredient in commercial fertilizer, is currently produced using fossil fuels and accounts for about 1.8% of global carbon emissions. But it could be replaced by green ammonia, which is produced with green hydrogen using renewable energy. While currently more expensive than conventional ammonia, green ammonia is projected to be economically viable within the decade, according to the report, which suggests mandates for 25% of ammonia to be green would help reduce food system emissions as well as speed up the growth of the green hydrogen sector. Green hydrogen is a much-hyped climate solution because of its potential to replace fossil fuels in incredibly energy-intensive industries, such as shipping, steelmaking and aviation.",20/01/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/01/19/world/three-climate-solutions-wri-intl/index.html
A dire forecast: Scientists used AI to find planet could cross critical warming threshold sooner than expected,"The planet could cross critical global warming thresholds sooner than previous models have predicted, even with concerted global climate action, according to a new study using machine learning. The study estimates that the planet could reach 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming above pre-industrial levels in a decade, and found a substantial possibility of global temperature rises crossing the 2-degree threshold by mid-century, even with significant global efforts to bring down planet-warming pollution. Data shows average global temperature has already climbed risen around 1.1 to 1.2 degrees since industrialization. Our results provide further evidence for high-impact climate change, over the next three decades, noted the report, published on Monday in the journal the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Under the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, countries have pledged to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees  and preferably to 1.5 degrees  compared to pre-industrial levels. Scientists have identified 1.5 degrees of warming as a key tipping point beyond which the chances of extreme flooding, drought, wildfires and food shortages will increase dramatically. Temperature rises over 2 degrees could bring catastrophic and potentially irreversible impacts, including pushing three billion people into chronic water scarcity. The study used artificial neural networks  a type of machine learning or artificial intelligence  which scientists trained on climate models and then used historical observations of temperature around the world as independent input from which the AI makes a prediction, said Noah Diffenbaugh, a professor at Stanford University and a co-author on the study. Diffenbaugh and his co-author Elizabeth Barnes, a professor at Colorado State University, assessed three different scenarios: Low, medium and high forcing climate pathways, which refer to the intensity of the heating caused by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In all three scenarios, the scientists estimated that the world would hit 1.5 degrees of warming between 2033 and 2035, even if planet-warming pollution is substantially reduced. Diffenbaugh said that while individual years are likely to reach 1.5 degrees sooner, their predictions are focused on how long until the global mean temperature was warmed 1.5 degrees. The studys prediction is in line with previous models. In a major report published in 2022, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimated that the world could cross the 1.5-degree threshold in the early 2030s. Where the study departs from many current projections is in its estimates of when the world will cross the 2-degree threshold. While the IPCC projects that in a low emissions scenario, global temperature rises are unlikely to hit 2 degrees by the end of the century, the study returned more concerning results. The AI predicted a probability of around 80% that 2 degrees warming will be reached before 2065, even if, over the next half century, the world reaches net-zero  where it removes at least as much planet-warming pollution from the atmosphere as it emits. If emissions stay high, Diffenbaugh said, the AI predicted a 50% probability that 2 degrees will be reached before 2050. There is clear evidence that a half degree of global warming poses substantial risks for people and ecosystems. Hence, the greater the global warming, the greater the challenges for adaptation, Diffenbaugh said. While many net zero decarbonization pledges and targets have been framed around holding global warming to 1.5 degrees, he added: The AI predictions in our study suggest that those may be necessary to avoid 2 degrees. The use of machine learning to make predictions is increasing in climate science, Diffenbaugh said. The AI is able to learn the most reliable indicators of how long is left until a given global warming level is reached in a large number of sometimes contradictory climate model predictions.",30/01/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/01/30/world/global-warming-critical-threshold-climate-intl/index.html
?he Ark?and ?UNG_E?both envision humans fleeing an Earth ruined by climate change,"Science fiction regularly explores exaggerated visions of real-world problems, including apprehensions about the climate crisis. In the last few weeks, thats produced a pair projects, Syfys The Ark and the Netflix movie JUNG_E, which begin from the premise that humans have so defiled Earth they need to venture out into space in order to find a new place to live. The idea certainly isnt a new one, having provided the foundation for the 2008 Disney/Pixar movie WALL-E, in which a lonely robot was left behind while bloated people took refuge in space. These new productions use the threat of climate calamity to explore different themes and sci-fi motifs  in the case of The Ark, which comes from producer Dean Devlin (of Independence Day and Stargate renown), what amounts to a wagon train of pioneers on a space-faring vessel; and in the South Korean film, a contemplation of artificial intelligence through a mother-daughter relationship and a decades-long civil war involving outposts of survivors. Both fall somewhat flat, in separate ways. Set 100 years in the future, The Ark focuses on Ark One, the first of several massive ships dispatched into space, each seeking to establish colonies that can offer salvation to those left behind. The occupants of the craft, however, are awakened prematurely from their cryogenic sleep by an unknown accident that has killed most of the mentor class, forcing junior officers and more youthful personnel to try to save the mission and the crew of 150 survivors on board. Alas, that conceit results in a lot of young-adult-oriented flourishes that come across as particularly stilted, as if the Star Trek cadet class was put in charge amid pressing concerns about water, food and other rations that werent expected to be needed this early in the voyage. If this sort of series is only as good as its characters, The Ark is a poorly populated enterprise, not to be confused with the Enterprise. As for JUNG_E, the film turns out to be visually striking and narratively muddled, with a story that starts somewhere in the middle, throws around lots of provocative science-fiction concepts and comes to a rather abrupt end. The narrative opens with humanity embroiled in 40 years of civil war, after climate change has forced people to off-planet shelters that have declared war on each other. Seeking to end the conflict, a team of scientists is working to create an army of warriors based on a legendary soldier, Yun Jung-yi (Kim Hyun-joo), using her brain data in android hosts more than 30 years after her death. Adding an emotional hook, the project is spearheaded by the soldiers now-grown daughter, Yun Seo-hyun (Kang Soo-youn, who died last year, shortly after completing work on the movie). Directed by Yeon Sang-ho (Train to Busan), JUNG_E devotes too much of its time to those research simulations, as the daughter and her team try to perfect the prototype. The importance of that plan feels hazy  that is, why the model in question is deemed a potential game-changer in the war  further confused by the machinations of the conglomerate behind it amid a conflict that has dragged on for decades. Perhaps inevitably, both The Ark and JUNG_E feel like mash-ups of previous sci-fi concepts. That includes the latters impressive design and look, which perhaps most closely resemble the Will Smith movie I, Robot in terms of the androids, with a pinch of Blade Runners grimy dystopia. Early pioneers sought better lives, so there are old-school underpinnings to the notion of venturing out among the stars  The final frontier, as Gene Roddenberry eloquently put it  as humanity pursues refuge. That becomes more sobering, of course, when people are forced to do so by their own failed stewardship of the planet. Yet while the concept is provocative, in science fiction its inevitably just a jumping-off point  and with these two projects, a start that leads to fairly forgettable journeys into the unknown. The Ark premieres February 1 at 10 p.m. ET on Syfy and Peacock. JUNG_E is available on Netflix.",02/02/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/02/entertainment/ark-and-jung-e-climate-change-sci-fi-shows/index.html
"Climate change is contributing to the rise of superbugs, new UN report says","Climate change and antimicrobial resistance are two of the greatest threats to global health, according to a new report from the United Nations Environment Programme. The report, titled Bracing for Superbugs, highlights the role of climate change and other environmental factors contributing to the rise of antimicrobial resistance. It was announced Tuesday at the Sixth Meeting of the Global Leaders Group on Antimicrobial Resistance in Barbados. Antimicrobial resistance or AMR happens when germs such as bacteria, viruses and fungi develop the ability to defeat the medications designed to kill them. The development and spread of AMR means that antimicrobials used to prevent and treat infections in humans, animals and plants might turn ineffective, with modern medicine no longer able to treat even mild infections, the UN Environment Programme said in a news release. Roughly 5 million deaths worldwide were associated with antimicrobial resistance in 2019, and the annual toll is expected to increase to 10 million by 2050 if steps arent taken to stop the spread of antimicrobial resistance, according to the report. In the US, there are nearly 3 million antimicrobial-resistant infections each year, and more than 35,000 people die as a result, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. Antimicrobials are commonly used in cleaning products, plant pesticides and medications to kill and prevent the spread of germs among people, animals and crops. Drug resistance can develop naturally, but experts say the overuse of antimicrobials in people, animals and food production has accelerated the process. The microorganisms that survive these chemicals are stronger and more powerful, and they can spread their drug-resistant genes to germs that have never been exposed to antimicrobials. The focus so far has largely been on excessive antimicrobial use, but experts say there is growing evidence that environmental factors play a significant role in the development, transmission and spread of antimicrobial resistance. Climate change, pollution, changes in our weather patterns, more rainfall, more closely packed, dense cities and urban areas  all of this facilitates the spread of antibiotic resistance. And I am certain that this is only going to go up with time unless we take relatively drastic measures to curb this, said Dr. Scott Roberts, an infectious diseases specialist at Yale School of Medicine, who was not involved with the new UN report. The climate crisis worsens antimicrobial resistance in several ways. Research has shown that increased temperatures increase both the rate of bacterial growth and the rate of the spread of antibiotic-resistant genes between microorganisms. As we get a more extreme climate, especially as it warms, the gradients that drive the evolution of resistance will actually accelerate. So, by curbing temperature rises and reducing the extremity of events, we can actually then fundamentally curb the probability of evolving new resistance, Dr. David Graham, a professor of ecosystems engineering at Newcastle University and one of the UN reports authors, said at a news conference ahead of the reports release. Experts also say severe flooding as a result of climate change can lead to conditions of overcrowding, poor sanitation and increased pollution, which are known to increase infection rates and antimicrobial resistance as human waste, heavy metals and other pollutants in water create favorable conditions for bugs to develop resistance. The same drivers that cause environmental degradation are worsening the antimicrobial resistance problem. The impacts of antimicrobial resistance could destroy our health and food systems, Inger Andersen, the UN Environment Programmes executive director, said at the news conference. Environmental pressures are creating bugs that thrive in the human body, which experts say is unusual for some species. Theres one hypothesis from a prominent mycologist who suggests that the reason the bodys temperature is 98.6 is because that is the temperature where fungi cant grow that well. And so, now were seeing Candida auris and some of the other new microbes that have come up that really grow quite well  even at temperatures of 98.6 in the human body. And so I think climate change, really selecting for these organisms to adapt to a warmer climate, is going to increase the odds that theres infection in humans, Roberts said. Such opportunistic infections jeopardize medical advancements like joint replacements, organ transplants and chemotherapy  procedures in which patients have a significant risk of infection and require effective antibiotics. Drug-resistant infections can make treatment difficult or even impossible. Roberts says that resorting to last-ditch treatments is never a good scenario from the patient level because there are reasons we dont use them up front, such as organ toxicity and failure. When somebody does present with a drug-resistant bacteria or fungus and we really need to rely on one of these last-line antibiotics, its usually a challenge to treat from the outset. And so the patients really dont do as well as a result, he said. In rare circumstances, we run out of options entirely, and in that case, theres really nothing we can do. Fortunately, those cases remain quite rare, but I am certain that with this growing antibiotic resistance problem, well see these increasing frequency over time. Experts say that both climate change and antimicrobial resistance have been worsened by and can be improved by human actions. One critical step is to limit antibiotic overuse and misuse. Antibiotics and antifungals do not work on viruses, such as colds and the flu. These drugs save lives. But, anytime they are used, they can lead to side effects and antimicrobial resistance, the UN reports authors wrote. The authors also emphasize that the health of people, animals, plants and the environment are closely linked and interdependent, and they call on governments to identify policies to limit antibiotic use in agriculture and reduce environmental pollution. Finally, experts say, steps to reduce climate change are steps to limit antimicrobial resistance. Whatever we can do on an individual level to kind of reduce the impact of climate change, really, thats kind of only worsening this problem, as well as pollution and urbanization and in dense, crowded areas. Although I know from the individual level thats a hard thing to change, Roberts said.",07/02/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/07/health/superbugs-climate-change-scn/index.html
This controversial climate solution could be exactly what the planet needs. Or it could be a colossal disaster,"When US startup Make Sunsets released two weather balloons into the skies above Mexicos Baja California peninsula last year, it kicked up a fierce debate about one of the worlds most controversial climate solutions. The plan was for the balloons, filled with helium and a small amount of sulfur dioxide, to float high into the stratosphere. There they would burst, dispersing their load of sun-reflecting sulfur dioxide particles and cool the Earth, just a tiny bit. Some dismissed it as a stunt. It is not clear if any particles were actually released or even if the balloons made it to the stratosphere. But Make Sunsets experiment is significant for crossing a threshold when it comes to a hotly-debated climate solution: solar geoengineering. To its supporters, solar geoengineering is a fix we cannot ignore as the world hurtles toward climate disaster. For critics, it is a technology so dangerous we shouldnt even research it. At its simplest, solar geoengineering, also known as solar radiation management, is an attempt to bring down the planets temperature by reflecting sunlight away or allowing more heat to escape into space. There are three main techniques: Marine cloud brightening involves trying to make the low clouds over the ocean more reflective by spraying them with sea salt. Cirrus cloud thinning targets wispy clouds higher up in the atmosphere, seeding them with aerosol particles in an attempt to thin them, so they trap less heat. The most-researched method, however, is stratospheric aerosol injection. It involves spraying aerosols  such as sulfur dioxide particles  into the stratosphere, more than 12 miles above the Earths surface, to reflect sunlight back into space. It could be done with balloons or specialized airplanes able to fly at high altitude. The idea takes its cue from volcanoes. When Mount Pinatubo erupted in the Philippines in 1991, the sulfur dioxide it expelled high into the atmosphere had the effect of temporarily cooling the planet by 0.5 degrees Celsius (nearly 1 degree Fahrenheit). The idea has been around since the 1960s, but its getting more attention because progress to tackle climate change is so far off-pace. The world is on track to pass critical warming thresholds, beyond which the chances of extreme flooding, drought, wildfires and food shortages increase dramatically. Scientists have even gone as far as to propose blowing moon dust toward the Earth to act as a sun shield, reducing the amount of sunlight reaching the planet. I wish there was no geoengineering! Luke Iseman, the founder of Make Sunsets told CNN in an email. But there are no other realistic options to stay below 2 [degrees Celsius], he said. While pretty much no one is claiming solar geoengineering could replace planet-warming pollution cuts and solve climate change, supporters argue it could have a big planetary cooling effect for a relatively small price tag. A 2018 Harvard study estimated it would cost around $2.25 billion a year over a 15-year period. The world needs to cut emissions, no question, David Keith, professor of applied physics and public policy, at Harvard University told CNN. But it doesnt mean we can afford to ignore other climate solutions, he added. Im not saying we have to do solar geoengineering, but I think its worth considering all the tools, he said. Chris Field, director of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment, told CNN there are good reasons to be skeptical of solar geoengineering. But, he said, if it could provide a path for decreasing the impacts of climate change on millions of the worlds most vulnerable people (and on ecosystems), we have a responsibility to explore the opportunities, as well as the risks. For some of the most at-risk countries, including low-lying island nations, climate change already threatens their existence. A 2019 survey of more than 700 climate experts found those who expected severe climate damage in their own countries were more supportive of solar geoengineering. In the eyes of its opponents, the technology could open the door to an almost infinite number of potential negative consequences. Just because were desperate doesnt suddenly make solar geoengineering a good idea, because the risks are so immense, Lili Fuhr, from the Center for International Environmental Law, told CNN. There are fears fiddling with the planets thermostat could alter rainfall patterns and shift monsoons, with potentially devastating consequences for crops. Effects could vary across regions, with some areas reaping benefits while others are harmed, increasing the chance of conflict. When things go wrong, it is usually the poor people that suffer the most, said Chukwumerije Okereke, professor of global climate and environmental governance at Alex Ekwueme Federal University in Nigeria. People are already suggesting African countries as a testing ground for the technologies, Okereke said. It is a distraction from the sort of policies and help that should be coming to Africa. Solar geoengineering could also damage the ozone layer, which shields Earth from harmful ultraviolet rays, and is currently on track to repair itself after the success of a ban on ozone-depleting chemicals. Then there are the difficulties of implementation. As the aerosol particles do not tend to remain in the atmosphere for more than about a year, solar geoengineering would have to be continuously maintained. If halted, there is a risk of termination shock, unleashing all the pent-up warming waiting in the wings, ready to slap the Earth in the face, Raymond Pierrehumbert, professor of physics at Oxford University, told CNN. It would also require unprecedented international cooperation, Frank Biermann, professor of global sustainability governance at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, told CNN. It would mean that countries have to collaborate forever, he said, including those currently at war. One of the biggest criticisms of solar geoengineering is it could be grasped by polluters as a way to continue polluting, and by governments as a distraction from policies to reduce planet-heating pollution. In 2021, a group of nearly 400 scientists called for an international non-use agreement, a commitment to restrict the development of solar geoengineering before it is too late. Governments should consider solar geoengineering in the same way they do chemical weapons, biological weapons, nuclear testing and Arctic mining, Biermann said. There has been a flurry of interest in the technology, especially in the US. In 2019, Congress allocated $4 million to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for stratospheric research, some of which was for solar geoengineering. And last year, the Biden administration announced a five-year research plan to explore the concept. A 2021 report from the National Academy of Sciences called for the US to allocate up to $200 million to a research program to better understand solar geoengineering, including its feasibility, impacts on society and the environment, and public perceptions. Research organizations are also providing funding. In February, the UK-based Degrees Initiative announced $900,000 for research in countries across Africa, Asia and South America to look at how the technology could affect the Global South. So far, outdoor experiments have been difficult to get off the ground and have faced heavy resistance. An attempt by Harvard University researchers to test a high-altitude balloon in Arctic Sweden in 2021 was abandoned after an outcry from local Indigenous Sami people. A letter on behalf of the Sami Council said solar geoengineering entails risks of catastrophic consequences. And following Make Sunsets balloon release, the Mexican government announced in January it would ban solar geoengineering experiments. As the world heats up and solar geoengineering shifts from sci-fi to mainstream, tussles between those who say there is an obligation to research it as a potential last-chance solution and those convinced it is the path to catastrophe are only likely to increase. Critics like Biermann, however, remain unwavering in their opposition. Its very risky. It cannot be governed. Its unethical, he said. And it is one of the biggest dangers in the current climate policies.",12/02/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/12/world/solar-dimming-geoengineering-climate-solution-intl/index.html
Water carved New Zealand? stunning landscape. Now too much is risking lives,"New Zealands Hawkes Bay is known for its fine wine, but many of the regions vineyards are now under water, along with homes and roads in the aftermath of Cyclone Gabrielle. The weather system didnt make landfall in New Zealand, but it caused widespread destruction, killing at least eight people, displacing thousands, destroying roads and cutting access to smaller communities in the countrys northeast. Prime Minister Chris Hipkins flew over the flood-hit areas on Thursday and said the extensive damage had made it clear the country was unprepared for extreme weather events  and there is a lot of work to be done. Were talking about roading, were talking about telecommunications, were talking about electricity and energy. Theres no question, weve got some big challenges ahead, he said, while visiting the flood-ravaged city of Gisborne. We cant continue the way that we have been going. We are going to see more of these types of weather events. So we have to be prepared. Hipkins didnt mention the climate crisis by name, but his climate change minister James Shaw made the link clear in an emotional address to parliament two days earlier. I dont think Ive ever felt as sad or as angry about the lost decades that we spent bickering and arguing about whether climate change was real or not, Shaw said on Tuesday. It is clearly here now, and if we do not act it will get worse. Whats made this weeks devastation so shocking is that it came just two weeks after a short, sharp deluge in Auckland, the countrys largest city of 1.7 million people. That downpour caused flash flooding and landslides, and contributed to New Zealands wettest month on record  all during whats typically one of the driest months of the year. New Zealand owes its stunning landscape partly to the countrys long record of intense rainfall. Rain regularly dumped on its mountains has carved rivers that rage after downpours. Many towns and cities sit on their banks  established to take advantage of access to ports and trade routes, which for a long time has served communities well. New Zealand is very good at building communities on floodplains  theres a large fraction of the population that live close to rivers that tend to flood, said James Renwick, a weather and climate researcher at Victoria University of Wellington. There tends to be the attitude that we can build stop banks and that will protect the community, and it does most of the time, until you get a really big event. Those really big events are expected to become more frequent as global temperatures warm. New Zealand lies in the South Pacific Ocean, and is vulnerable to tropical cyclones that typically form in the north but can affect any part of the country in their path. This week, the northeast suffered the biggest hit as Cyclone Gabrielle whipped up winds and days of rain. La Nina, a weather event that results in warmer air and sea temperatures, also contributed to Gabrielles strength. Sam Dean, principal scientist at the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research or NIWA, said climate change is not necessarily going to increase the frequency of tropical cyclones, but it will make them more powerful. Theyre occurring over sea surface temperatures that are warmer than they were. The atmosphere is warmer and its holding more moisture, so theres just more fuel, more energy available that makes them more intense, it makes them more damaging, he said. It makes the winds a little bit stronger. It makes the rainfall more significant. And cyclones like Gabrielle can form and move around just about any part of the country, he said, so the risk isnt just in one part of the nation. I dont think theres any part of New Zealand that isnt at risk of extreme rainfall, he said. But heavy rainfall isnt the only risk posed by climate change in New Zealand, long considered a safe haven by those seeking refuge from global troubles. Parts of the country have experienced drought in recent years, and even a few years ago, Auckland  the city hit by a short bout of intense rainfall in January  was close to running out of water. The whole area is usually very dry and very close to drought this time of year. Now its soaking wet, said Daithi Stone, a climate scientist at NIWA. But that risk of drought hasnt gone away, (and) in our predictions of how climate change is going to affect New Zealand, thats a feature that seems to be fairly robust  that Northland (north of Auckland) will get drier. Heat waves could also become a risk in a country thats not accustomed to unbearably hot temperatures, Stone added. Were not used to heat waves ... over here, its a novel concept. And I think we may get a fright sometime in the not too distant future, he said. With just 5 million people, New Zealand is a small player when it comes to global carbon emissions. Last year, it produced 78.8 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent  well below the biggest emitters, China and the United States. But the New Zealand government takes climate change seriously, and last year released its first emissions reductions plan to meet a goal of net zero emissions by 2050. It also released a national adaptation plan to mitigate climate disasters in the future. Dean, from NIWA, said Cyclone Gabrielle was likely to prompt an acceleration of that plan. You can see an urgency to get some of these things in place and I think thats been motivated, definitely, by this event, he said. Renwick, from Victoria University, said an obvious solution would be to move people away from coastlines and rivers that are at risk of more frequent flooding. But he said communities with long ties to the area will likely be reluctant to leave, and he predicted a greater emphasis on protection than relocation. I suspect the main response is going to be protection works rather than moving people away. So building sea walls, building levees, stop banks, putting houses up on higher piles, he said. During his visit to Gisborne, Hipkins said Cyclone Gabrielle had made clear to him that the country needs to improve its climate defenses. Theres no question that as a country we need to look at the resilience of our infrastructure. And we need to do that with a much greater sense of urgency, I think, than we have ever seen before, he said. That may include spending money to relocate roads subject to repeated flooding, he added. We actually just have to get real about some of the roads and the fact that were going to have to move some of those roads to places where they can be more resilient. But aside from adapting, as a small country, New Zealand is reliant on the biggest emitters doing more to prevent global temperatures rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius  the threshold scientists say is needed to prevent the more catastrophic effects of the climate crisis. The world is already at least 1.1 degrees Celsius warmer than it was before industrialization. What we need to see is China and the US, Australia, Canada, Brazil and the big emitters starting to pull their emissions down as well, and I hope we can provide a bit of inspiration, a bit of an example in this country to help other countries do the same, Renwick said. We really want to stop warming the climate more because these extreme events will become overwhelming.",15/02/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/15/asia/new-zealand-climate-crisis-gabrielle-intl-hnk/index.html
"Nearly 30 dangerous feedback loops could permanently shift the Earth? climate, scientists say","Dangerous climate feedback loops are increasing global warming and risk causing a permanent shift away from the Earths current climate, according to a new study. Climate feedback loops are cyclical chain reactions that happen when one change triggers further changes, in a process that keeps on repeating itself. Some of these feedback loops drive down warming, but others amplify it. Take Arctic ice, for example. Warming temperatures cause sea ice to melt, revealing the dark ocean water beneath. As dark surfaces absorb more heat than reflective surfaces like ice, the ocean warms and more ice melts. A group of international scientists from institutions including Oregon State University, Exeter University and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, pored over climate literature to identify 41 climate feedback loops. Of these, they found that 27 are driving up global temperatures, according to the study published Friday in the scientific journal One Earth, while just seven are helping to slow the pace of climate crisis. William Ripple, Professor of Ecology at Oregon State University and a lead author on the study, told CNN that forest die-off, smoldering peatlands and thawing permafrost were particularly worrisome. These feedbacks may be large and are difficult to accurately quantify, Ripple told CNN. The researchers were surprised by the large number of amplifying climate feedback loops they found, he added. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most extensive list available of climate feedback loops, and not all of them are fully considered in climate models, Christopher Wolf, a postdoctoral scholar at Oregon State University and the studys other lead author, said in a statement. Climate feedback loops can also indirectly affect each other, according to the study, creating a complex web of interconnected changes that can accelerate the impacts of the climate crisis. For example, planet-warming pollution released by thawing permafrost  the frozen layer of soil that blankets the Arctic and other parts of the planets far north  increases global temperatures, which in turn helps create the hotter, drier conditions that make wildfires spread faster and burn more intensely. Wildfires release planet-heating pollution, further raising temperatures, and so on. These interconnections make it challenging to predict the precise impacts of climate change, Ripple said. There is a risk that some of these feedback loops could trigger climate tipping points. For example, feedback loops accelerating Arctic ice melt could ultimately cause the Greenland ice sheet to collapse. In the worst case, if amplifying feedbacks are strong enough, the result is likely tragic climate change thats moved beyond anything humans can control, Ripple said in a statement. The study also found seven dampening feedback loops, which help stabilize the climate system. These included the ability of land and oceans to absorb planet-heating carbon emissions. Its important to try to get a handle on the strength of all these feedbacks, Tim Lenton, Chair in Climate Change and Earth System Science at the University of Exeter and one of the co-authors, told CNN, to better understand how they work within the complex climate system. We, already at 1.5 [degrees Celsius], are likely to cross multiple tipping points, causing feedback loops that would make our options for a safe climate future even fewer, Johan Rockstrom, Director of the Potsdam institute and a co-author of the study, told CNN. The authors called for immediate and massive reductions in planet-warming pollution, as well as increased research into climate feedback loops. Its too late to fully prevent the pain of climate change, but if we take meaningful steps soon while prioritizing human basic needs and social justice, it could still be possible to limit the harm, Ripple said.",17/02/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/17/world/climate-feedback-loops-tipping-points-arctic-ice-intl/index.html
"China provinces and Florida among the most climate-vulnerable regions in the world, analysis finds","China is home to 16 of the 20 regions of the world most vulnerable to climate change, according to data published on Monday, with some of the worlds most important manufacturing hubs at risk from rising water levels and extreme weather. The state of Florida ranked as the most vulnerable region outside of China. Climate risk specialists XDI assessed more than 2,600 regions worldwide, using climate models together with weather and environmental data to assess the economic damage that temperature rises could cause by 2050. The study is based on a 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) increase in temperatures by the end of the century, under a scenario drawn up by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The data showed that some of the engine rooms of the global economy face catastrophic hazards such as rising sea levels, river flooding and wildfires, which could also lower property prices and deter investment, XDI said. The Chinese coastal province of Jiangsu, which is heavily industrialized and accounts for a tenth of Chinas GDP, was ranked the worlds most vulnerable territory, followed by neighboring Shandong and the major steel production base of Hebei. The flood-prone central province of Henan was fourth. The shift of global manufacturing to Asia has driven a substantial increase in infrastructure investment in already vulnerable regions throughout China, making it more susceptible to the impacts of climate change, Hamden said. Infrastructure investment has tended to be concentrated in areas that have traditionally been very high-risk - river deltas, coastal zones, and relatively flat areas, he said. The highest ranking non-Chinese region was Florida in 10th place, with California 19th, Texas 20th and New York 46th. Nine territories from India were also in the top 50. While climate is likely to become increasingly decisive when it comes to determining the flow of capital, it remains to be seen whether it will deter investment in more vulnerable regions, said Karl Mallon, XDIs co-founder. There is a lot to be done to work out which areas in the world are potentially adaptable and defendable, and which are probably the areas we will see abandoned in due course, he said.",20/02/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/20/world/regions-climate-risk-extreme-weather-china-florida-xdi-intl/index.html
Why the climate crisis may be coming for your margarita next,"Something to consider as you search for happy hours to celebrate National Margarita Day: The delicious concoctions main ingredient is threatened by changing weather and new strain on the agave plants vital pollinator  the bat. Agave-based liquor like tequila and mezcal was the fastest growing spirits category in 2022, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the US. Analysts even say it might soon surpass vodka as the best-selling liquor in the country. But scientists from around the world have made it clear that climate change-fueled water shortages will continue to put enormous pressure on food production. Wine and spirits, unfortunately, are not spared from that forecast. A 2019 study found that the climate crisis, coupled with overgrazing from cattle ranching and other human activities, may disrupt the distribution and cultivation of agave, the main ingredient of tequila. While agave is a drought-tolerant plant that can thrive in hot weather with little to no water, Omanjana Goswami, a food and environment scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the life cycle of agave is too fragile to endure the major weather whiplash the climate crisis is generating  from extreme drought to deadly storm deluges like the one California just experienced. Agave is a desert plant, so of course, anything that is moving towards that desert-like weather is going to help this crop thrive, Goswami told CNN. But unfortunately, climate effects are not linear. It doesnt mean that as temperatures warm that will remain consistent. With extreme weather in conjunction with unpredictability, its so hard to predict where this is going to go in the future, she added. Aside from agave plants being sensitive to weather whiplash, theres also a significant climate threat to pollinators. Bees, butterflies and bats pollinate roughly 30% of the food that ends up on our tables. Bats, like birds, are also considered a major seed disperser. But as temperatures warm, weather gets more extreme and seasons shift, those pollinators are at risk of major disruption. Warming temperatures have become a growing concern for the Mexican long-nosed bat  a key species for tequila. You wouldnt have tequila if you had no bats, because thats the only thing that pollinates the agave plant that makes tequila, Ron Magill, the communications director and a wildlife expert at Zoo Miami, previously told CNN. There are hundreds of species of agave, but only one  the Weber Azul agave plant  makes tequila. Other agave species were abandoned in Mexico and in the desert regions of the Southwest US. By law, to be considered authentic tequila, the spirit must come from the Tequila region in Mexico. Otherwise, agave liquors produced in places like California can only be labeled as an agave spirit. Because of the high demand for agave spirits, its easy for farmers to fall into the practice of monoculture, where they reuse the same soil to grow a single crop, leading to a loss in genetic diversity, scientists told CNN. That includes places like California, where farmers do not rely on external pollinators like bats to grow their agave crops. But some researchers like Ron Runnebaum, an assistant professor of viticulture and enology at the University of California, Davis, are looking to explore more of that genetic diversity to see what variants besides the blue agave can adapt and survive in a changing climate to avoid the loss in diversity. For us, in the United States, and especially in California, there are just a lot of questions around how we would be able to grow this economically as a crop as a way of diversifying the portfolios of farmers, as theyre facing water shortages, as well as these other extreme events whether extended droughts or an abundance of water in a short period of time, Runnebaum told CNN. Agave plants require little watering and can allow farmers to plant crops on land that would have otherwise been fallowed due to lack of water. And while it takes six to eight years for agave plants to mature, scientists say agave plants can also suck planet-warming carbon pollution out of the atmosphere. Given these benefits  and as the West is mired in a multi-year drought  Craig Reynolds, an agave grower and founding director of the California Agave Council, said he sees agave spirits as an economic opportunity in a hotter and drier future. Eight years ago, Reynolds began growing agave in Northern California as an experiment to see if it would be a viable crop in response to water scarcity. Weve gotten a lot of attention, because the biggest issue (for farmers) is the water, he told CNN. The severe cutbacks and groundwater allowances in state and federal water project deliveries, and the fallowing of hundreds of thousands of acres in California and projected long-term fallowing of farmland is causing the growing interest, he said. With the help of UC Davis, more resources are going into researching the viability of the low-water crop, especially under a rapidly changing climate. Reynolds said industries need to start adapting and thinking about ways to survive in a hotter and drier future. Theres going to be some failures and setbacks here and there, Reynolds said. Im not hoping for the climate to change. Im just realistic in that we need to do everything we can to slow climate change, but we also have to simultaneously have adaptation strategies to the climate change that is happening  and agave is just part of the adaptation strategy.",22/02/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/22/us/margarita-tequila-agave-climate-crisis/index.html
"?he climate time-bomb is ticking? The world is running out of time to avoid catastrophe, new UN report warns","The world is rapidly approaching catastrophic levels of heating with international climate goals set to slip out of reach unless immediate and radical action is taken, according to a new UN-backed report. The climate time-bomb is ticking, said Antonio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, in a statement to mark the launch of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changes synthesis report on Monday. Humanity is on thin ice  and that ice is melting fast, he added. The report draws on the findings of hundreds of scientists to provide a comprehensive assessment of how the climate crisis is unfolding. The science is not new  the report pulls together what the IPCC has already set out in a cluster of other reports over the last few years  but it paints a very stark picture of where the world is heading. This report is the most dire and troubling assessment yet of the spiraling climate impacts we all face if systemic changes are not made now, Sara Shaw, program coordinator at Friends of the Earth International, said in a statement. The impacts of planet-warming pollution are already more severe than expected and we are hurtling towards increasingly dangerous and irreversible consequences, the report says. While the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels is still possible, the report noted, the pathway to achieving it is rapidly closing as global production of planet-heating pollution continues to increase  emissions grew by nearly 1% last year. Concentrations of carbon pollution in the atmosphere are at their highest level for more than two million years and the rate of temperature rise over the last half a century is the highest in 2,000 years. The impacts of the climate crisis continue to fall hardest on poorer, vulnerable countries that have done least to cause it. Our planet is already reeling from severe climate impacts, from scorching heat waves and destructive storms to severe droughts and water shortages, said Ani Dasgupta, president and CEO of World Resources Institute, in a statement. The biggest threat to climate change action is the worlds continued addiction to burning fossil fuels, which still make up more than 80% of the worlds energy and 75% of human-caused planet-heating pollution. Despite the International Energy Agency saying in 2021 that there can now be no new fossil fuel developments if the world is to meet climate commitments, governments are continuing to approve oil, gas and coal projects. The Biden administration has just greenlit the hugely controversial Willow oil drilling project in Alaska. Once operational, it is projected to produce enough oil to release 9.2 million metric tons of planet-warming carbon pollution a year  equivalent to adding 2 million gas-powered cars to the roads. Arati Prabhakar, the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said in a statement that the new UN report shows the Earths future is not predetermined. It underscores the urgent need for leaders in every sector and every country to step up and take bold climate action, Prabhakar said. China is planning a huge expansion of coal  the dirtiest of fossil fuels. In 2022, it granted permits for coal production across 82 sites, equal to starting two large coal power plants each week, according to a report last month. But Mondays report also set out pathways to keep the world on track to limit warming to within 1.5 degrees. This IPCC report is both a blistering condemnation of major emitters inaction and a sound blueprint for a much safer and more equitable world, Dasgupta said. Staving off the worst impacts of the climate crisis will require radical shifts across every sector of the economy and society, according to the report. It called for deep cuts to planet-heating pollution by moving away from fossil fuels and investing in renewable energy. To limit warming to 1.5 degrees, global levels of planet-heating pollution must fall by 60% by 2035 compared with 2019, according to the report. It emphasized the need for greater investment to build resilience to climate impacts, and increased support for people struggling with climate-related losses, especially in the most vulnerable countries. The report also said we need to remove carbon from the air, including potentially through technology such as direct air capture  removing carbon directly from the air and storing it, possibly by injecting it underground. This technology does remain divisive, however, as some believe it distracts from policies to cut planet-heating pollution. In my country, Sri Lanka, the impacts of climate change are being felt now. We have no time to chase fairy tales like carbon removal technologies to suck carbon out of the air, Hemantha Withanage, chair of Friends of the Earth International, said in a statement. Guterres called on all countries to massively fast-track climate efforts and, specifically, for rich countries to hit the fast-forward button on commitments to reach net-zero  which means removing as much plant-heating pollution from the atmosphere as they emit. For the first time, he said developed countries must reach net-zero as close to 2040 as possible, far earlier than the 2050 deadline a lot of countries  including the US and the UK  have pledged to meet. Todays IPCC report is a how-to guide to defuse the climate time-bomb, Guterres said. But it will take a quantum leap in climate action, he added. The report, which was signed off over the weekend by representatives from the UNs nearly 200 countries, will feed into the next UN climate conference, COP28, in Dubai at the end of the year. The conference will include the first global stocktake from the Paris Climate Agreement, an assessment of progress toward addressing the climate crisis and averting climate catastrophe.",20/03/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/20/world/ipcc-synthesis-report-climate-intl/index.html
"Global water crisis could ?piral out of control?due to overconsumption and climate change, UN report warns","The world is facing a looming global water crisis that threatens to spiral out of control as increased demand for water and the intensifying impacts of the climate crisis put huge pressure on water resources, a UN report has warned. Water use has increased by about 1% a year over the last 40 years, driven by population growth and changing consumption patters, according to the UN World Water Development Report published Tuesday, on the eve of a major UN water summit in New York. By 2050, the number of people in cities facing water scarcity is projected to nearly double from 930 million people in 2016 to up to 2.4 billion, the report found. Urban water demand is expected to increase by 80% by 2050. Without action to address the problem of water scarcity, there definitely will be a global crisis, said Richard Connor, the reports lead author, at a news conference to launch the report. Water access is already a huge problem. Two billion people do not currently have safe drinking water and 3.6 billion lack access to safely managed sanitation, according to the report. About 10% of the global population already lives in countries with high or critical water stress. Urban and industrial growth and agriculture are compounding existing shortages, with agriculture alone using up 70% of the worlds water supply, Connor said. Seasonal water scarcity is set to increase in areas where water is currently plentiful including in Central Africa, East Asia and parts of South America, the report found. Meanwhile, scarcity will worsen in the Middle East and the Sahel region in Africa, where water is already in short supply. Extreme and prolonged droughts, made more frequent and severe by the climate crisis, are also putting pressure on ecosystems, which could have dire consequences for plant and animal species, the reports authors said. Solutions include better international cooperation to avoid conflicts over water, Connor said. Flood and pollution control, data sharing and efforts to reduce levels of planet-heating pollution should open the door to further collaboration and increase access to water funds, he said. There is an urgent need to establish strong international mechanisms to prevent the global water crisis from spiraling out of control, said Audrey Azoulay, the director general of UNESCO, the UNs cultural body. Water is our common future, and it is essential to act together to share it equitably and manage it sustainably.",22/03/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/22/world/global-water-crisis-un-report-climate-intl/index.html
"As Antarctica? penguins struggle with record low sea ice, one species is adapting ?and it offers lessons to us all","One hundred years ago, colorful canaries warned humans of the hidden hazards of digging for coal by riding shotgun down the mine and dropping dead. Now, penguin experts say these birds that move like tuxedoed toddlers are showing us the hidden hazards of burning coal and other fossil fuels by the way they march. And as global warming changes the survival-of-the-fittest game at the bottom of the world, one particular species of Antarctic penguin is modeling a poignant lesson for humanity: Adapt or die...and make it quick. With numbers in the millions, Antarcticas six species of waddling aquabats are far from extinction and as I stepped foot on the Antarctic peninsula in early March, and drank in the wildest place Ive ever seen, there were hundreds there to make an adorable first impression. Colonies were brimming with life. But then I learned how the Southern Ocean warmed by the climate crisis is turning my little boys favorite bird into a sentinel species of the Anthropocene. While some are abandoning nesting sites where chicks have been hatching for thousands of years to find better ground, colonies of those that refuse to move have collapsed. It is incredible, Heather Lynch, the Endowed Chair for Ecology and Evolution at Stony Brook University told CNN. As ecologists, we know that animals shift their range over geologic times, they disappear in one area and colonize new areas. But its rare to see those dynamics happening over the course of ones career. Along with seals, seabirds and baleen whales, penguins gorge mainly on Antarctic krill, a shrimp-like crustacean that thrives on the kind of phytoplankton found under sea ice. Unlike the Arctic, where sea ice has declined consistently, Antarctic sea ice has swung up and down  although recently scientists have seen a steep downwards trend. At the end of the Southern Hemisphere winter in September 2014, there were more than 7.7 million square miles of frozen saltwater floating around Antarctica  a record high  and many species like humpback whales were feasting on krill and thriving. But early this year, sea ice reached a record-shattering low of less than 700,000 square miles, breaking the previous record set just last year. If we have a 1 degree [Celsius] temperature change in a temperate environment such as the UK or the US, who cares? Tom Hart, biology lecturer at Oxford Brookes University explained. Doesnt ruin your day. But down there, 1 degree makes a huge difference  whether you can stand on water or sink into it. Or whether theres snow cover on a breeding site or not. Its a completely different habitat. Using satellites, camera traps, citizen science and AI computing to keep tabs on millions of penguins around Antarctica, Hart and Lynch say they are watching a real-time lesson in evolution and adaptation. While Adelie and chinstrap penguins remain stuck in their ancient ways come hell or warm water, the much more flexible gentoo penguins are ranging further and further south. And as they show willingness to chase new prey or abandon a nest to increase the odds of long-term survival, their numbers are exploding. Gentoo penguins are big climate change winners in the Antarctic, Lynch said, confirming reports that some colonies in some parts have grown by 30,000%. They are perfectly happy to take advantage of a warming Antarctic. They dont mind that its getting wetter. The flip side of that is that the Adelie and chinstrap populations have cratered in many areas and particularly chinstrap penguins. Their populations have declined in some areas by as much as 80%. Adaptation means several things, Hart said. It means being really tough in a hard environment but it also means reading the room on seasonality. It means averaging, so if you dont do well one year, youve got to do better. And then you really only have to do well one year in three. I think theres a lesson in here for us as well, Lynch said. If we just stick to what weve always done, its not going to turn out well for us. Just because Manhattan has always been where it is, does it make sense that it will be there in 200 or 300 years? I dont know. But I think we would benefit from being plastic and flexible and adaptive. And I think thats kind of what the gentoos are telling us. Along with the worry that a crash in krill could follow the crash in ice, avian flu is now present in Chile and Argentina and Hart predicts it could migrate with seabirds to the Antarctic Peninsula next spring and devastate penguin colonies. I think were in for a horrible year next year, he told me. But we wont know until it happens. These cascading threats also make gentoos an example of what humans in the world of terrifying UN climate reports call the hard and soft limits of adaptation. If political or financial hurdles block an available strategy, its considered a soft limit. But if the physical changes are too sudden and severe, there is a hard limit to finding any fix at all. As I saw during the expedition in early March, even the roll-with-the-punches gentoos are struggling after a warmer, wetter Antarctic created snow and rain events freakish enough to delay this years penguin nesting season by a month. We watched with grim resignation as gentoo couples gathered rocks for worthless nests and mothers hatched chicks that simply wont have enough time to grow the feathers and fat needed to survive winter. But Lynch reminded me that was one colony on one island, and so far, what doesnt kill a gentoo only makes it tougher. If they changed neighborhoods so easily, she believes, theyll just shift the timing of their baby-making season. I think that if there was a permanent shift towards a snowy year climate, gentoo penguins would probably start breeding earlier, she said. I think the gentoos are going to be just fine.",26/03/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/26/world/antarctica-penguin-sea-ice-climate/index.html
? win of epic proportions? World? highest court can set out countries?climate obligations after Vanuatu secures historic UN vote,"Pacific Island nation of Vanuatu on Wednesday won a historic vote at the United Nations that calls on the worlds highest court to establish for the first time the obligations countries have to address the climate crisis  and the consequences if they dont. Vanuatu has long faced the disproportionate impacts of rising seas and intensifying storms. And in 2021, it launched its call for the UN International Court of Justice to provide an advisory opinion on the legal responsibility of governments to fight the climate crisis, arguing that climate change has become a human rights issue for Pacific Islanders. Although the advisory opinion will be non-binding, it will carry significant weight and authority and could inform climate negotiations as well as future climate lawsuits around the world. It could also strengthen the position of climate-vulnerable countries in international negotiations. This year has already been rough for Vanuatu: It is currently under a six-month state of emergency after a rare pair of Category 4 cyclones pummeled the country within 48 hours during the first week of March. The islands residents are still picking their way through the storms rubble. Wednesdays resolution for an advisory opinion passed by majority, backed by more than 130 countries. Two of the worlds largest climate polluters, the US and China, did not express support, but did not object meaning the measure passed by consensus. This is the first time the highest international court is called on to address the climate crisis. The landmark decision is essential, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said in his remarks to the assembly. Climate justice is both a moral imperative and a prerequisite for effective global climate action. Advisory opinions have tremendous importance and can have a long-standing impact on the international legal order, Guterres said. Today we have witnessed a win for climate justice of epic proportions, said Ishmael Kalsakau, prime minister of Vanuatu, soon after the resolution was adopted. The very fact that a small Pacific island nation like Vanuatu was able to successfully spearhead such a transformative outcome speaks to the incredible support from all corners of the globe. Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatus minister of climate change adaptation, told CNN that he hopes the opinion would be greatly persuasive in terms of increasing domestic action and identifying what gaps in international law and domestic law need to be filled. It is quite historic, he added. The push to seek an advisory opinion from the worlds highest court began in an environmental law class in Fiji in 2019. Cynthia Houniuhi, president of Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change, said she and her peers had been looking for ways to address the climate crisis head-on through various international legal pathways, until they decided on the International Court of Justice. To be honest, at first, I was very hesitant when this idea was discussed, Houniuhi said. My mind keeps telling me to back off. I mean, lets be real here, it was too ambitious to say the least. Like, how can a small group of students from the Pacific Region convince the majority of the UN members to support this unique initiative? But as Pacific Island nations continue to suffer from hotter temperatures and more droughts, rising sea levels, and increasingly intense cyclones, Houniuhi realized they needed to do this. What is the use of learning all this knowledge if its not for people to fight the single greatest threat to their security? she said. For me, the memories of my childhood growing up in my village with my people are slowly fading, as the environment that sustained us disintegrates before our eyes. Tropical cyclones are not rare in Oceania, but Vanuatu, which has the highest disaster risk in the world, suffers disproportionately highly. Scientists say these storms are intensifying as the planet warms and will continue to carry a tremendous economic toll. According to Regenvanu, the financial damage caused by the recent twin cyclones will likely amount to more than half of Vanuatus GDP. Its an enormous impact, he said. We just have to try to recover, rebuild, all the while knowing that we are coming up to the next climate impact. To get support for their idea, the Pacific Island students passed around a petition that garnered signatures from teachers and students. And while campaigning for the initiative, they drafted a letter and proposal that they sent to Pacific Island governments. After receiving positive feedback from Vanuatu, the student members met with Regenvanu, who was the foreign affairs minister at the time. I could empathize with them, and I share their convictions and passions, Regenvanu said. I was very happy to receive that proposal and to commit to advancing it. The Vanuatu government kept its word, endorsing the proposal and taking it to the international stage. It was history in the making, Houniuhi said. I dont want to show a picture to my child one day of my island. I want my child to be able to experience the same environment in the same culture that I grew up in. During last years UN Climate Week in New York City, a group of Pacific Islander climate activists amped up the pressure on UN leaders, who were gathering for the annual UN General Assembly to discuss climate change-related matters. Along the East River in front of the UN headquarters, students and climate activists sailed in a flotilla of boats, flying the flags of more than a dozen Pacific Island nations while calling on leaders to vote yes to their request for an advisory opinion. The momentum continued two months later at the UNs COP27 climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, where world leaders and negotiators agreed to create a loss and damage fund, which Vanuatu first proposed back in 1991. The idea is that rich countries  which have contributed the most to climate change with their planet-warming pollution  should pay poorer nations to recover from the resulting disasters. Its a great injustice when you see oil companies make billions in profits when countries like ours in the Pacific are looking for and seeking support for climate adaptation and mitigation, said Lavetanalagi Seru, Fijian climate activist and regional policy coordinator with the Pacific Islands Climate Action Network. And now, we are living through an era of loss and damage. While the advisory opinion is separate from loss and damage, Regenvanu said they are both rooted in climate justice. Having an advisory opinion from the highest court would provide legal clarity of how a loss and damage fund would work. The ICJ advisory opinion will come at a the right time to help us define what loss and damage means [and] how it will work, he said. Regenvanu said Vanuatus request brings attention to the legal avenues small countries can take to fend off the worsening effects of the climate crisis. While the Paris Agreement is an essential part of the international legal framework for climate action, it is certainly not the only instrument ... nor is it the most legally enforceable, Regenvanu said. It could still take around 18 months for an opinion to be issued, with countries able to provide input into the process. The climate change minister will now head home to Vanuatu, where he said he will rejoin the ongoing relief efforts after the recent storms. Were basically constantly in a state of recovery in response to climate disasters, Regenvanu said. This is why we are so passionate on the climate change front, because this is our reality, and we need to deal with it, and we need other countries to assist us to deal with it.",29/03/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/29/world/un-advisory-opinion-vanuatu-climate-change/index.html
Ten photographs that made the world wake up to climate change,"Water cascading from a wall of ice with gray brushstrokes of clouds overhead makes for a beautiful image  but the story behind it is one of destruction; Earths glaciers are melting at an unprecedented rate due to human-caused climate change. Canadian photographer Paul Nicklen remembers taking the photograph. It was August 2014, and temperatures in Svalbard, Norway, were unusually warm  hovering above 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius). As he came around the corner of an ice cap on Nordaustlandet island, he saw more than a dozen waterfalls pouring off its face. It was the most poetic, beautiful scene Id ever seen, but it was also haunting and scary, he recalls. The picture came to symbolize the realities of climate change and became Nicklens best-selling fine art image. It appeared multiple times in National Geographic, was used by Al Gore in his climate talks, and graced the cover of Pearl Jams 2020 album Gigaton, the title of which refers to the unit used to calculate ice mass. Its beauty is central to its impact, believes Nicklen. When you take a photograph that is in focus, properly exposed, moody and powerful, it creates a visceral reaction, he says. It has to be beautiful and engaging, it has to invite you in ... and it has to have a conservation message. In 2014, Nicklen, along with his wife Cristina Mittermeier, and later joined by Andy Mann (both also award-winning photographers), co-founded the nonprofit organization SeaLegacy, which uses film and photography to raise awareness of climate issues and help protect the planet. Photography is one of the most effective and powerful tools we have to tell complex stories, like the story of climate change, says Mittermeier. She witnessed this power with one of her own photographs, taken in August 2017, which showed a starving polar bear. After being published in National Geographic, the photo and accompanying video went viral, shared on social media and by news organizations worldwide. It sparked a global conversation on climate change, provoking responses ranging from concern and empathy to climate denial. But there was no denying that it shook the world: People still remember it and have strong reactions when they see it, Mittermeier reflects. As guest editors for CNNs Call to Earth series, Nicklen and Mittermeier selected these two images, along with eight others, that they believe have alerted the world to the climate crisis. Nicklen compares photographing climate change to photographing conflict. Were out there on the front lines of the war being waged against our planet. Its emotionally draining, exhausting, he says. In recent decades, as climate disasters have become more frequent and intense, images have more explicitly captured the urgency of the situation. Six dead giraffes, bodies emaciated from the lack of food and water, photographed by Ed Ram, show the horror of Kenyas prolonged ongoing drought, which has threatened and displaced animals and humans alike. Photographs of wildfires, like those that ravaged Australia in 2019 and 2020, show the scale of devastation, with homes on fire and wildlife fleeing in despair. They show that climate change isnt just happening somewhere else, its happening everywhere, says Mittermeier. All of a sudden, it will come knocking a lot closer to your own door. Mittermeier remembers the work of her friend and one of her great influences, Gary Braasch, who she describes as a chronicler of climate change. The photographer, who died in 2016, dedicated the last two decades of his life to documenting how the Earth was changing in response to global warming  from Antarctica, with its melting glaciers, to Bhola Island in Bangladesh, where sea level rise and increasing erosion have turned villages into islands. Braaschs commitment to the cause blazed the way for Nicklen and Mittermeiers generation of conservation photographers. At times however, climate change can be tediously slow to chronicle. Sea levels rise by a matter of millimeters each year  a barely visible increment despite happening at a faster rate than ever before. But such changes add up, and if they are visually documented over years or decades the impact becomes clear. Its like photographing a slow-moving tsunami, says Mittermeier. Its often hard to see in the moment, but when two images are put side-by-side, its hard not to see the impact the climate crisis is having. Read: Scientists are listening to glaciers to discover the secrets of the oceans The work of photographer James Balog has been crucial in creating the visual narrative of climate change, she says. Using a network of time-lapse cameras recording glaciers around the world, his Extreme Ice Survey has demonstrated how glaciers are vanishing over time. The extensive archive of photos of each glacier taken year-round at every daylight hour has also provided a baseline from which future changes can be measured. It became just irrefutable proof, says Mittermeier. That was a very important moment for climate photography. Mittermeier and Nicklen also selected images where humans and nature collide. One effect of climate change is a dramatic loss of biodiversity. Since 1970, wildlife populations have plummeted by 69%, due predominantly to land-use change that has fragmented crucial habitats, and also rising temperatures, which have led to mass mortality events, according to the WWFs 2022 Living Planet Report. Read: The icy patience of an Arctic photographer With the Arctic warming nearly four times faster than the rest of the globe, the ice that polar bears depend on is melting away. Dmitry Kokhs photograph House of Bears, one of the winners of the 2022 Wildlife Photographer of the Year award, shows polar bears roaming an abandoned Soviet settlement on Kolyuchin Island. While the buildings had long been deserted, Mittermeier believes it points to the increasing problem of polar bears  with no ice left to hunt on  encroaching on human spaces and encountering local people, leading to tragic outcomes for both sides. The effects of climate change will  and are already  hitting animals and humans alike. Its impossible to deny that we are all in this together, says Mittermeier. We are all impacted in devastating ways, and we cannot separate ourselves from the life we share this planet with. The series The Day May Break from photographer Nick Brandt portrays this by showing people and animals affected by environmental destruction. The photographs, taken in animal sanctuaries around the world, feature people that have been displaced by climate change events such as drought or floods, and animals that have been victims of habitat destruction or wildlife trafficking. Portraying both in the same frame shows how deeply our fates are intertwined. Among the images of devastation and displacement, there are also those that signify hope. In Brandts work, he points out that the subjects of the images, both people and animals, are survivors  And therein lies hope and possibility, he wrote in an email. Read: The oceans blue carbon can be our secret weapon in fighting climate change For Mittermeier and Nicklen, and SeaLegacy as a whole, striking a message of hope is vital to the wider mission. Martin Luther King didnt start his famous speech by reminding us that we live in a nightmare  he told us what the dream is, says Mittermeier. You have to point out what it is that were aspiring to and show where the hope is. The hope, she believes, is in wildlife and the ocean. Humans are just waking up to the role that both play in mitigating climate change, and restoring nature will be crucial in averting the crisis. For Mittermeier, her photograph of a sea lion rising up to the surface in the Galapagos  one of the largest marine protected areas in the world  shows how ocean life can flourish with the right protection. And Nicklens photograph of a bowhead whale represents to him one of our greatest allies in decarbonization: not only are whales bodies enormous stores of carbon, their feces fuels phytoplankton which soak up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. By showing off the beauty of the planet, the couple believe they can show people it is still worth fighting for. Were trying to climb to the tallest mountain and scream from the mountaintops that this planet is dying, and that we are at risk, says Nicklen. But the only emotion greater than fear is hope, adds Mittermeier. And the only way you can feel hope is if you take action.",29/03/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/29/world/climate-change-photography-paul-nicklen-cristina-mittermeier-c2e-spc-intl-scn-climate/index.html
Feds will release more water downstream into drought-stricken Lake Mead after wet winter,"After years of punishing drought, a historic winter snowpack is bringing a reprieve to the Colorado River Basin and the nations largest reservoirs. The US Bureau of Reclamation announced Thursday that this winters rain and the projected runoff from above-normal snowfall is expected to boost its water releases this year from Lake Powell to Lake Mead by 2.5 million acre-feet. Thats an extra 814 billion gallons water, and welcome news for the communities, farmers and tribes who rely on the reservoir. In total, Glen Canyon Dam, which forms Lake Powell, is now expected to release up to 9.5 million acre-feet of water downstream to Lake Mead and its Hoover Dam  the equivalent of nearly 4.7 million Olympic-sized swimming pools. It far exceeds the 7 million acre-feet release that was initially expected, but was boosted after the bureau analyzed annual snow runoff projections this month. Water levels at Mead have plummeted over the last few years, dropping so low that they revealed ancient volcanic rock, previously sunken boats and several bodies. With that additional water, officials project that Lake Meads water elevation is expected to rise to about 1,068 feet by the end of the year  approximately 33 feet higher than they projected last month, and around 25 feet higher than it was at the end of 2022. The snow and the amount of liquid water stored in it on the surrounding mountain peaks is well-above average for this time of year. Once it melts, that precipitation will serve as a lifeline for 40 million people in the Western US  including Los Angeles, Phoenix, and Las Vegas  who depend on it for drinking water, crop irrigation and hydropower. Still, even with this winters incredible snowpack, federal officials are warning that one good year is not enough to reverse many years of severe drought. Lakes Powell and Mead still have a combined storage capacity of just 26%, officials said. This winters snowpack is promising and provides us the opportunity to help replenish Lakes Mead and Powell in the near-term  but the reality is that drought conditions in the Colorado River Basin have been more than two decades in the making, Reclamation commissioner Camille Calimlim Touton said in a statement. Despite this years welcomed snow, the Colorado River system remains at risk from the ongoing impacts of the climate crisis. Reclamation and the Interior Department are analyzing what dramatic, additional water cuts could look like to prevent the river basin from crashing. One scenario could severely wipe out Arizonas allotment of Colorado River, since the state has a junior priority compared to California. The agencies are expected to finalize a decision on new water cuts later this summer.",20/04/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/20/us/lake-mead-colorado-river-water-releases-climate/index.html
The world? biggest banks are still pouring money into fossil fuels,"Banks have pledged to go green, but last year they poured billions of dollars into expanding the capacity of fossil fuel production despite the accelerating climate crisis. Banks provided $673 billion to finance the fossil fuel industry last year, even as oil and gas companies made $4 trillion in profits, according to the annual Banking on Climate Chaos report, authored by a group of nonprofits including The Rainforest Action Network and the Sierra Club. While Canadian banks are providing a rising share of the money, US lenders still dominate the market and accounted for 28% of all fossil fuel financing in 2022, said the report. At the top of that list is JPMorgan Chase, the largest funder of fossil fuels cumulatively since the Paris Agreement on climate change was signed in 2016, according to the report. Citi, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America are also among the top five fossil financiers since 2016, the report found. Major US banks stalled on their net-zero plans and failed to adopt stronger and more robust financing restrictions for companies pushing unsustainable fossil fuel expansion, said Adele Shraiman, senior campaign representative for the Sierra Clubs Fossil-Free Finance Campaign, in a statement. Oil and gas companies have seen skyrocketing growth as the energy crisis triggered by Russias war in Ukraine sent prices soaring, challenging peoples quality of life and financial stability. The global oil and gas industrys profits jumped to $4 trillion in 2022, up from an average of $1.5 trillion in recent years, International Energy Agency chief Fatih Birol said in February. High prices have swelled profits for energy companies, leaving them flush with cash. And their shareholders are feeling that windfall thanks to huge stock buyback programs. The record profits come after the worlds 60 largest private banks provided $5.5 trillion in finance for fossil fuels over the past seven years, according to the report. JPMorgan Chase, Citi, Wells Fargo and Bank of America are all members of the UNs Net-Zero Banking Alliance, a group of banks committed to achieving carbon neutrality in their operations by 2050. By turning their backs on their climate pledges and doubling down on their support for the fossil fuel industry, Wall Street banks are increasing the likelihood of systemic risks to the economy, including a coastal property values collapse, a carbon bubble crash, and insurance market turmoil, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said in a statement. A spokesperson from the Net Zero Banking Alliance previously told CNN that comprehensive transitional plans will require years to plan and execute. An immediate divestment from existing fossil fuel positions could lead to extreme market shocks that could profoundly impact the worlds most vulnerable people, the spokesperson added. We provide financing across the energy sector: supporting energy security, helping clients accelerate their low carbon transition and increasing clean energy financing with a target of $1 trillion for green initiatives by 2030, Charlotte Powell, head of sustainability communications at JPMorgan told CNN. The Banking on Climate Chaos report, which has been published for 14 years, examines the fossil fuel funding of the 60 largest banks in the world. Its authors also include BankTrack, Indigenous Environmental Network, Oil Change International, Reclaim Finance, and Urgewald. Tesla helped kick off an EV price war, reports my CNN colleague Chris Isidore. Now, those lower prices are hitting the companys sales and profits. The automaker earned about 22% less in the first quarter than it did last year and its profits fell even more compared to the third and fourth quarters of 2022. That comes after Tesla cut its prices four times this quarter, and twice this month alone. Even with record car deliveries, the lower prices caused revenue to fall $1.3 billion compared to the fourth quarter. Asked about the future direction of its profit margins, Tesla executives declined to give any guidance. This is a difficult environment to make a projection like this. Theres a lot of macro uncertainty, said CFO Zachary Kirkhorn. Theres also headwinds and tailwinds. On a call with investors, CEO Elon Musk defended the price cuts, even if it means lower profit margins in the near term. While we reduced prices considerably in early Q1, its worth noting that our operating margin remains among the best in the industry, he said. Weve taken a view that pushing for higher volumes and a larger fleet is the right choice here versus a lower volume and higher margins. Investors are expecting an earnings recession this quarter. But so far, the companies reporting have largely beaten estimates. Thats lead to some early optimism about how the first quarter may shake out. Those investors should put away their party hats, said Bryan Reilly, a portfolio manager at CIBC Private Wealth US, in a note on Wednesday. While the first quarter earnings of large cap financials have come in reasonably strong and better than feared, investors should not get a false sense of security from these early reports, he wrote. Weakening in retail sales, industrial production, and services as the first quarter progressed has shown that the Fed rate hikes have begun to bite at economic growth. That slower growth coupled with higher costs remaining sticky for most companies has forced a rethinking of the path of corporate profit margins. And even though companies are beating estimates, theyre not beating by as much as they usually do. S&P 500 companies are surpassing earnings-per-share estimates by 7.9% in aggregate, according to recent FactSet data. Thats below the 5-year average of 8.4%. As of FactSets most recent report, the overall earnings decline for S&P 500 companies this quarter is expected to be around 6.5%. That would mark the largest earnings decline since 2020.",20/04/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/20/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html
US President Joe Biden pledges $500 million to curb Amazon deforestation,"United States President Joe Biden pledged a $500 million investment to the Amazon Fund on Thursday, a sum that would make his country one of the worlds largest donors to the international conservation program to protect the Amazon rainforest from deforestation. Today, Im pleased to announce that I will request the funds so that we can contribute $500 million to the Amazon Fund and other climate-related activities over the next five years to support Brazils renewed effort to end deforestation by 2030, Biden said during a virtual meeting of the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate. The Amazon Fund uses foreign funds for projects that fight deforestation and preserve the environment in the Amazon, and was set up in Brazil during President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silvas previous term in office. Major donors include Norway and Germany. During the presidency of former Brazilian leader Jair Bolsonaro, the fund was left untouched while then-environmental minister Ricardo Salles dissolved committees responsible for managing the resource. Lula has touted curbing deforestation of the Amazon as a top priority since becoming president earlier this year. Biden also promised a $1 billion contribution to the Green Climate Fund, which is the main climate financing mechanism of the United Nations. Were at a moment of great peril but also great possibilities, serious possibilities. With the right commitment and follow-through from every nation on the  in this room, in this  on this call, the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees can stay within reach, Biden added. The announcement comes the same day Biden welcomed Colombian President Gustavo Petro to the White House, saying he considers Colombia the key to the hemisphere, in efforts to ensure the Western Hemisphere is united, equal, democratic, and economically prosperous. At Thursdays Oval office meeting with Petro, Biden also spoke to efforts to combat narcotics trafficking in the region, and to address historic levels of migration in the hemisphere. Biden touted the $500 million investment to the Amazon Fund as part of the two nations efforts to deal with climate change. And he took special care to thank Petro for the hospitality support Colombia continues to show to Venezuelan refugees. Its a humanitarian and generous thing that youre doing, he added. You know were working closely with regional partners to help Columbia meet this challenge. Its consequential and costly. Petro noted that the United States and Colombia have a shared commitment to democracy, freedom and peace together with a strong push for decarbonizing the economy. In the Americas, humanity has the greatest potential for democracy and freedom and the greatest potential for carbon free energy. We have a busy agenda together and work to do, Petro stated. Petro is in Washington as part of a five-day trip to the US to celebrate the 200th anniversary of US-Colombia relations. He held talks at the United Nations and the Organization of American States and visited Capitol Hill to meet with congressmen in the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.",20/04/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/20/americas/us-biden-amazon-fund-petro-intl-latam/index.html
Why this rusting industrial city could be Greece? next tourism hotspot,"Perched on a hill facing the crystal-clear sea waters of Greeces Saronic Gulf, ancient Eleusis stood in full splendor over 3,000 years ago, attracting the powerful, the famous and the curious. One of the most sacred cities of its time, its gleaming marble temples promised an entry point to the underworld and insight to its mysteries. Eleusis in Greek means arrival. For centuries, initiates sworn to secrecy walked the 13-mile road from Athens known as the sacred way in torchlit processions, to take part in the Eleusinian Mysteries  rituals whose fame spread across the ancient world and remain one of antiquitys best kept secrets. Powerful mountains formed an awe-inspiring backdrop to sanctuaries devoted to Demeter, the goddess of agriculture and fertility, and her daughter Persephone, who were worshiped here. The myth of Persephone, who every year returns from the underworld, was used to explain the change of the seasons. The eternal cycle of natures life, death, and rebirth formed the Mysteries theme. In more modern times, Eleusis has fallen from grace, as heavy industry both on land and in the water obscured its ancient marvels with construction and pollution. Yet now the city is back in the spotlight. For 2023, its been given the title as a Cultural Capital of Europe  a title it shares with Timisoara in Romania and Veszprem in Hungary. For the occasion, the citys magnificent archaeological site has been overhauled, improving its accessibility. And its renovated archaeological museum has just reopened. Being a Cultural Capital has helped dozens of cities that have previously held the title to foster urban regeneration and find a spot on the travel radar. Organizers of Eleusis 2023, a program of artistic events, are hoping for similar results. An opening ceremony in early February offered a glimpse of the creativity in store. Eleusis historic processions were revived with a modern twist as a Belgian collective called TimeCircus made a grand entry having traversed Europe pushing The Landship, a gigantic cart powered by human strength. A spectacular light installation of a whale lit up the night sky, highlighting an environmental focus. And, in the grounds of an old paint factory, Stereo Nova, Greeces most popular electronic music duo of the 1990s, reunited for a one-off live event. Among upcoming highlights this summer is a play, Ma, by Italian director and playwright Romeo Castellucci, a performance specially created to be staged in Eleusis archaeological site. Eleusis, the birthplace of Aeschylus, known as the father of tragedy, is not only the oldest but also the smallest city to have ever been selected as Cultural Capital since the concept was created nearly 40 years ago. Its also one in great need of improving its image  and environmental track record. In the 19th and early 20th centuries Eleusis became a major industrial port. Factories, steel mills and shipyards drew thousands of workers from all parts of the country and region. Heavy industry took over the once stunning bay. A blessing and a curse, industry kept thousands out of poverty but it also caused major environmental degradation, especially in the 1960s and 1970s when exponential growth was unregulated. Smog obscured the beautiful views. The bay transformed into a ship graveyard. Eleusis became a modern version of the underworld, the sacred way having morphed into a road to hell. Since the early 2000s much of that industry has declined. Environmental regulations are now better enforced and greater effort has been made to contain pollution. Tall chimneys continue to tower above the archaeological space and an oil refinery, the biggest in Greece, looms in the distance. Eleusis Mayor Argyris Economou admits there is still a long way to go. But we have started. Some of the old factories, among them monuments of industrial architecture, are now being transformed into cultural venues, as are some relics of local decline. The repurposed former paint factory, a former olive oil mill and an old bowling alley are some of the 30 locations hosting this years events. Titled Mysteries in Transition, the cultural program brings together over 300 Greek and international artists. In a recent interview with CNN, Despoina Geroulanou, the late president of 2023 Eleusis Cultural Capital, described a long-term vision, a hub for the arts with residencies, annual festivals, educational programs. Digital nomads. A new community that will blend with the existing one. A legacy that benefits the city and its people. The prospect is already bringing optimism to the citys streets. Antonious deli is a local institution that first opened its doors in the 1950s. Nikos Antoniou, the son of the original owner, presides over a range of cheeses and artisanal delicacies from around Greece. Hes cautiously hopeful. The Cultural Capital could boost local businesses and also highlight the hidden beauty of Eleusis, Antoniou says. I grew up here with pollution being the main concern. A lot more needs to be done. Swimming in Eleusis is still only a dream. Relics from the old ships graveyard remain in the bay. The rusting hulls are a fascinating site, but also an environmental time bomb. Michael Scoullos, professor of environmental chemistry at the University of Athens and director of its Laboratory of Environmental Chemistry, has conducted extensive research and monitored water pollution in Eleusis for decades. A strong environmental voice, he has led battles to clean up the area. The bay of Eleusis is not dead, he says. We are talking about a patient who can recover with the right treatment  and already partly has. A few years ago, for the first time ever, I saw dolphins and sea turtles, even a seal. A land of legend, for so long snubbed by Athenians and visitors alike, Eleusis is seizing its moment. The potential is there for all to see, and is neatly symbolized in the Ploutonion Cave, an eerie passage in the archaeological site that was believed to be a link between our world and the underworld  a transition point between light and darkness. Todays visitors to Eleusis will find pedestrianized roads lined with blossoming tangerine trees and colorful coffee shops that make for pleasant strolling, even in the winter. The blue and white seafront taverns add a small-town charm as leisurely ouzo drinkers fill their tables. For a moment it almost feels like postcard Greece. Developers have been eying the derelict factories, in much the same way that industrial areas on the fringes of other global cities have been earmarked for hipsterization. Just down the coastline  recently dubbed the Athens Riviera, a regeneration plan is already underway that will transform Ellinikon, the 600-acre site of Athens former airport, into Europes largest luxury development. For now, Eleusis remains a workers city of around 30,000 inhabitants. A stronghold of labor movements, proud of the role that migrants have played in its history and continue to play today  it currently hosts Ukrainians fleeing Russian aggression at a camp that has previously been home to Syrians and other Middle Eastern refugees. More than one million visitors from the US alone are expected in Greece this year, according to the Greek Tourism Ministry, which has forecast a strong year for tourism. And with the majority of international flights landing in Athens, Eleusis is perfectly located as an easy-to-reach destination. Eleusis is also a growing attraction point for a new breed of experiential traveler, says Yannis Zaras, the managing director of Big Olive, an Athens-based destination management company. People are rethinking what guides their destination choices. They want context that goes beyond the cliches of nice or eye-pleasing. In a very contemporary context of environmental awareness and climate change: mistakes made, lessons learned, changes in the making, future. Eleusis is exactly that.",20/04/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/greece-eleusis-city-of-culture/index.html
"Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are melting rapidly and driving sea level rise, new satellite data finds","The Earths ice sheets lost enough ice over the last 30 years to create an ice cube 12 miles high, according to new research. The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, which hold almost all of the worlds freshwater ice, are shrinking at a frighteningly rapid pace, according to a report on Thursday from a team of international scientists. Combining data from 50 satellite surveys of Antarctica and Greenland, spanning the years 1992 to 2020, scientists from the Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise, or IMBIE, were able to track changes in the ice sheets volume and ice flow. They found that ice sheet melting has increased six-fold over the past 30 years, as record levels of planet-heating pollution push up global temperatures. The seven worst years for polar ice sheet melting all happened during the past decade. In all, the polar ice sheets lost more than 8.3 trillion tons of ice between 1992 and 2020, according to the report. The worst year for ice sheet loss was 2019, the report found, when the ice sheets lost around 675 billion tons of ice. These losses were driven by an Arctic heatwave, which saw Greenlands ice sheet shed 489 billion tons. The loss of ice is having a significant impact on the oceans, pushing up sea levels by 21 millimeters (just less than an inch), according to the report. Ice sheet melting now accounts for a quarter of all sea level rise  a fivefold increase since the 1990s. This is a huge amount of ice, study lead author Ines Otosaka, a research fellow at the University of Leeds, told CNN. This is very worrying, of course, because 40% of the global population lives in coastal areas, she said. Scientists found that the rate at which the Antarctic ice sheet is melting has slowed, but remains much faster than in the 1990s. The report identified the Antarctic Peninsula and West Antarctica  the location of the troubled Thwaites Glacier, nicknamed the Doomsday glacier for its potentially devastating impact on sea level rise  as the regions where most of the continents melt was happening. Otosaka expects the Greenland ice sheet to continue losing ice, but said its not yet clear what might happen to the Antarctic ice sheet. In Antarctica we have higher uncertainty in the future, she said.We have what we call some low-probability but high-impact mechanisms that could be triggered if we exceed a certain level of warming. That could lead to a much higher sea level rise in the future, she added. If the world hits certain warming thresholds, it could trigger important and potentially irreversible feedback mechanisms, Otosaka said. We really need to have strong governmental policies to limit future warming and to cut our greenhouse gas concentration, she added. The European Space Agency, which along with NASA helps fund IMBIEs research, said in a statement: It is without doubt that climate change is causing our polar ice sheets to melt, thereby driving up sea levels and putting coastal regions around the world at risk. Scientists at IMBIE plan to update the assessment every year. We are finally at the stage where we can continuously update our assessments of ice sheet mass balance as there are enough satellites in space monitoring them, which means that people can make use of our findings immediately, Andrew Shepherd, a professor at Northumbria University and founder of IMBIE, said in a statement.",20/04/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/20/world/greenland-antarctic-ice-sheets-melt-climate-intl/index.html
DOJ reaches multimillion-dollar settlements against oil and gas companies it says were failing to control harmful leaks,"The Justice Department reached multimillion-dollar settlements in three major lawsuits against US oil and gas companies Thursday that it says will reduce air pollution and planet-warming gas emissions in a dozen states and Indian Country. The settlements aim to resolve claims that several large companies were using faulty equipment to manufacture and refine natural gas, failed to control leaks and allowed hazardous air pollution to seep into the atmosphere in violation of the Clean Air Act standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency. Each settlement is still subject to approval by a federal judge and will undergo a 30-day public comment period. As part of the settlements, the companies will spend approximately $16 million combined on repairs, upgrades and other ways to fix the problems, according to the department. The details of the settlements were shared first with CNN. The agreements are a major move in the Justice Departments effort to prioritize mitigation efforts as part of environmental lawsuits related to the climate crisis  and signal a willingness to target large fossil fuel companies. The department has undertaken an environmental justice effort to involve communities impacted by the climate crisis in understanding how company practices are contributing to the harmful personal effects of climate change. Nearly 36% of Americans live in areas with unhealthy air quality, according to the American Lung Association, and low-income communities and communities of color face disproportionate risks from pollution and the impacts of the climate crisis, scientists and health experts have reported. Having these Clean Air Act rules on the books, having state leak detection rules on the books, and actually enforcing this is sending a message to this entire industry that this matters, and we need you to be paying attention to these leaks, Kate Konschnik, the principal deputy assistant attorney general for the Justice Departments Environment and Natural Resources Division said in an interview with CNN Thursday. We expect you to do what is necessary to protect human health and the environment, Konschnik said. When fully implemented, according to the Justice Department, the three settlements have the potential to reduce ozone-producing air pollution by an estimated 953 tons per year and planet-warming pollution  including methane  by 50,633 tons per year. Air quality for communities in 12 states and Indian Country will be measurably improved over the long term as a result of these three settlements, Todd Kim, the assistant attorney general in the departments environment division, said in a statement Thursday. Kim said that the settlements show the departments commitment to reduce harmful air pollution  including emissions that exacerbate climate change  and provide environmental justice for those disproportionately impacted. The prevalence of faulty equipment is not new: scientists have raised concerns over what they say are inadequate government measures to detect methane leaks from fossil fuel pipes, wells and compressors. Scientists have encouraged the EPA to leverage new technology to get a fuller picture of how much of this potent greenhouse gas is escaping into the atmosphere and hold companies accountable for the leaks. As part of all three agreements, the gas companies committed to implementing plans to address the leaks, installing new equipment that leak less and performing independent audits. In one of the cases, the Justice Department alleged that several companies  The Williams Companies, Inc., seven Williams entities, and Harvest Four Corners LLC  were failing to control the amount of pollution emitted into the atmosphere. The second case addresses allegations that a gas company in Colorado, WES DJ Gathering LLC, contributed to poor air quality because they too failed to control the amount of harmful pollution in several gas processing plants and compressor stations in the Denver area. A third complaint launched similar allegations against MPLX LP, a company that handles crude oil. The department alleged that MPLX was failing to control the amount of pollution in seven gas processing plants and three compressor stations, again in large part due to outdated equipment. MPLX committed to plugging and remediating four abandoned wells in North Dakota, while WDJG agreed to replace equipment with new, environmentally friendly machines and permanently retire some equipment from the early 1980s. For its part, Harvest agreed to install technology to monitor equipment at the Ignacio Gas Plant on the Southern Ute Indian Reservation to ensure it is working properly and have agreed to implement stringent new requirements if it is not. CORRECTION: This story has been corrected to reflect the locations impacted by the settlement and the percentage of Americans living in areas with unhealthy air quality.",20/04/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/20/politics/doj-gas-company-pollution-settlements-climate/index.html
Biden announces new environmental justice initiatives,"President Joe Biden announced new environmental justice actions on Friday, including an executive order that the White House says will make environmental justice a central mission of federal agencies. Under this order, environmental justice will become the responsibility of every single federal agency  I mean, every single federal agency, Biden pledged at a White House Rose Garden signing ceremony surrounded by climate and environmental justice advocates just before Earth Day. He continued, Every federal agency must take into account environmental health impacts on communities and work to prevent those negative impacts. Environmental justice will be the mission of the entire government woven directly into how we work with state, local, tribal, and territorial governments. The executive order, which will still be up to agencies to implement, will create a new Office of Environmental Justice inside the White House Council on Environmental Quality. Fridays move comes as as many environmental justice groups have been frustrated at the administrations recent approval of a major Alaska oil project. CNN also reported Friday that the Biden administration is planning to roll out aggressive new rules to regulate planet-warming pollution from natural gas power plants  a move that could face fierce legal challenges. Fridays move also took place as Biden is preparing to announce his reelection bid as soon as next week, CNN reported Thursday. During his last presidential campaign, he worked hard to court environmental justice activist groups. Bidens new order directs agencies to work more closely with impacted communities and improve gaps in scientific data to try to better tackle the impacts of pollution on peoples health, a White House official said. If toxic substances were released from a federal facility in the future, the order requires federal agencies to notify nearby communities. The order comes a few years after Biden announced his signature Justice40 initiative, vowing to direct 40% of federal climate and clean funding from new legislation to disadvantaged communities. On Friday, three additional agencies  the Department of Commerce, the National Science Foundation and NASA  will also join the initiative. Biden also took a swipe at Republicans in his speech, contrasting his action on environmental justice with the GOPs policies. During his remarks on Friday, the president detailed how hes spent much of his tenure in office surveying damage from extreme weather events, calling the threat of climate change an existential threat to our nation and criticizing congressional Republicans for attempting to block his legislative priorities focused on climate. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, recently unveiled provisions in his debt limit proposal that would overturn clean energy tax credits passed in the Inflation Reduction Act last year. The proposal also includes HR 1  the GOPs version of an energy permitting bill. Republicans, Biden argued, would rather threaten to default on the US economy, or get rid of some $30 billion in taxpayer subsidies ... than getting rid of $30 billion in taxpayer subsidies to an oil industry that made $200 billion last year. Imagine seeing all this happen  the wildfires, the storms, the floods  and doing nothing about it, he continued. Imagine taking all these clean energy jobs away from working class folks all across America. Imagine turning your back on all those moms and dads living in towns poisoned by pollution and telling them, Sorry, youre on your own. We cant let that happen.

EPA is preparing aggressive new rules for power plant pollution that could prompt legal challenges,"The Biden administration is planning to roll out aggressive new rules to regulate planet-warming pollution from natural gas power plants, three sources familiar with the plan and who have been briefed on the rules told CNN, in a move that could face fierce legal challenges. President Joe Bidens Environmental Protection Agency has been exploring ways to tighten the rules for not just new power plants that will run on natural gas, but existing plants too, the sources said. According to the sources, the rules would be more stringent than previously planned regulations, which aimed to control pollution from new natural gas power plants and would have effectively grandfathered existing plants into older rules. The EPAs new strategy on power plants has gained traction in the administration in the past few weeks, one source said, amid intense pressure from environmental groups. The Biden administration frustrated those groups  and young, climate-minded voters  when it approved the controversial Willow oil drilling project in Alaska in March. Since then, the administration has put forward an ambitious vehicle tailpipe rule that could revolutionize the car market in the US and see electric vehicles making up two-thirds of new car sales by 2032. Importantly for the forthcoming power plant regulations, the electricity sector generates a quarter of all planet-warming pollution in the US, according to the EPA, and slashing that pollution quickly is key for the country to achieve net-zero climate emissions by 2050, as Biden has pledged to do. The EPA did not comment on the details of the plan, noting that they were still under review. But EPA spokesperson Tim Carroll told CNN that the agency is moving urgently to advance standards that protect people and the planet, building on the momentum from President Bidens Investing in America economic agenda, including proposals to address carbon emissions from new and existing power plants. Once the interagency review process is completed, EPA looks forward to sharing more information with stakeholders and the public, Carroll said. A source familiar with the plan said the rules show the EPA and Biden administration appear to have fully learned the lessons of the Clean Power Plan. During the Obama administration, the EPA put forward a broad-reaching power-plant rule that the US Supreme Court later threw out. The Biden administration is now trying to balance strengthening the countrys pollution standards with regulations that can stand up to further legal challenges from Republican-led states and the fossil fuel industry. This is not an exercise in policy creativity, as much as climate advocates would like them to be, the source said. Thats not what these rules are going to be. Massive amounts of funding for clean energy in the Inflation Reduction Act was a factor that helped push the administration toward the stronger rules. But it could spur concerns around the reliability of the electrical grid  especially as the Biden administration and automobile makers move aggressively toward electric vehicles. Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, who represents coal-heavy West Virginia and who was the one of the lead authors of the Inflation Reduction Act, has voiced concerns about retiring coal-fired power plants. The rules, which could be announced as early as Thursday, are among the most highly watched forthcoming actions from the EPA, after the Supreme Court curbed the agencys ability to regulate emissions from power plants last year. The Supreme Court ruling said the EPA does have some authority to regulate planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions, but it limited the ways the agency could do so, saying it has the authority to regulate power plants activities inside their fence lines  with things such as carbon-capture systems  but couldnt force them to transition to cleaner sources of energy. However, rules enforcing things such as carbon capture could ultimately encourage power plants to transition to renewable energy like wind and solar. Carbon capture technology is still quite expensive, and some utilities have chosen to shut down older, coal-fired power plants rather than outfitting them with the pricey equipment. Still, the EPA rules on existing and new natural gas plants are significant, since many utilities that are shutting down their coal plants are replacing them with natural gas. It is not yet clear whether the EPA will propose outfitting natural gas plants with carbon capture or similar, pollution-reducing technology.",21/04/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/21/politics/epa-power-plant-rules-climate/index.html
The world just failed its annual health checkup,"Droughts, floods and record low ice levels  from the top of the worlds mountains to the depths of the ocean, the climate crisis took a heavy toll as it continued to intensify in 2022, new analysis from the World Meteorological Organization shows. The WMOs annual State of the Climate Report, published Friday ahead of Earth Day, is essentially a health checkup for the world. It analyzes a series of global climate indicators  including levels of planet-heating pollution, sea level rise and ocean heat  to understand how the planet is responding to climate change and the impact it is having on people and nature. The findings paint a stark picture. 2022 was a year of extremes for the planet  and this continues the trend set in previous years, Omar Baddour, head of the Climate Monitoring and Policy Division at the WMO, told CNN. A slew of climate records were broken, many of which have been, or are on course to be, broken again this year: These broad climate indicators are an important reflection of the state of the planet, the report noted, but extreme weather events  fueled by climate change  are where the immediate effects are most felt. While greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise and the climate continues to change, populations worldwide continue to be gravely impacted by extreme weather and climate events, WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said in a statement. Last year, climate change-fueled extreme weather affected tens of millions, drove food insecurity, boosted mass migration, and cost billions of dollars in loss and damage, he said. In 2022, China had its most extensive and long-lasting drought on record. Droughts also affected East Africa, with more than 20 million people in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia facing acute food insecurity as of January this year. Many western and southern US states experienced significant drought and Europes punishing heatwave is estimated to have led to 15,000 excess deaths. In Pakistan, record-breaking rainfall left huge swaths of the country underwater, killing more than 1,700 people, with almost 8 million displaced, and causing $30 billion in damages. The most vulnerable are the hardest hit, Baddour said. Communities and countries which have contributed least to climate change suffer disproportionately. Last year is unlikely to be an outlier, as temperatures continue their upwards trajectory. The past eight years were the hottest on record, despite three consecutive years of the La Nina climate phenomenon, which has a global cooling effect. The global average temperature last year climbed to about 1.15 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, according to the report, as the world continues its march towards breaching 1.5 degrees of warming for the first time. With the predicted arrival later in the year of El Nino, which brings warmer global temperatures, scientists are deeply concerned that 2023 and 2024 will continue to smash climate records. The hottest year on record, 2016, was the result of a strong El Nino and climate change, said Baddour. It is only a matter of time before that record is broken. The WMO report follows an analysis published Thursday by the European Unions Copernicus Climate Change Service, which focused on how climate change affected Europe last year. It highlighted alarming changes to the continents climate, including the hottest summer ever recorded, unprecedented marine heatwaves in the Mediterranean sea and widespread wildfires. The droughts and level of heatwaves that we saw throughout 2022 were quite remarkable, Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus, told CNN. This is really a wake up call that climate change isnt a future problem, it is a current problem. And we need to adapt as quickly as possible, she added.",21/04/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/21/world/wmo-report-state-of-climate-intl/index.html
Are these the most sustainable architectural projects in the world?,"A solar-powered safari lodge in the Botswanan wilderness built from repurposed boardwalk planks. A subterranean apartment anchored by ceiling beams made from plastic bottles and construction dirt. A carbon-neutral furniture factory that doubles as a 300-acre public park. These are just a few of the latest design-driven buildings that are reimagining sustainable architecture, according to Architectural Digest.In the face of the climate crisis, the magazine's international issue features a number of innovative projects offering solutions to high carbon emissions, energy consumption and wasteful construction materials. ""Sustainability, as a concept, has become a bit of a catchall,"" wrote AD's global editorial director Amy Astley over email. ""We at AD use the word to convey strategies that prioritize longevity, whether looking at a building, a community, or our planet, and make great efforts to clarify the ways in which a project strives to be sustainable.""Among the buildings highlighted is the Reggio School, an education facility in Madrid which managed to reduce its material usage by 48% after Spanish architect Andres Jaque embraced the structure's exposed mechanical systems and bare interior walls. Outside, 80% of the school's facade is wrapped in cork  a natural material that encourages biodiversity. ""The irregular surface of the cork projection is designed to allow organic material to accumulate. The envelope of the building will eventually become the habitat of numerous forms of microbiological fungi, vegetal and animal life,"" read a press release from Jaque's architecture firm. ""The building will live as a constant transformation,"" added Maite Sebastia, AD head of editorial content in Spain, over email. Designed by renowned architect Bjarke Ingels, the Plus, a new factory for Norwegian furniture brand Vestre, has become the first industrial building to receive an ""Outstanding"" BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method) rating. The BREEAM measuring system rates buildings' environmental performance; according to Ingels, the factory releases 50% less greenhouse gasses than comparable facilities. With an almost ecclesiastical floor plan, the building's four wings extend into a 300-acre public park designed to entice employees and visitors alike to enjoy nature. ""You can make the world cleaner and more fun at the same stroke,"" Ingels told AD.And a public pool in Lagos, Nigeria was also applauded as an important urban regenerative project. First built in 1928 with funding from doctor and philanthropist John Randle, the Art Deco facility had sat empty since the 1970s. Now, though, the vibrant red and yellow building has been given a new lease of life by Lagos-based architecture firm SI.SA, and is set to reopen this summer as the new John Randle Centre for Yoruba Culture & History.""It is an impossible task to capture the latest sustainability news in a single article,"" wrote AD global features director, Sam Cochran, in an email.

These tiny creatures are losing their battle to survive. Here? what we can do to save them,"The Rufous Hummingbird is magical. The males iridescent throat glows brighter than a shiny copper penny and like most hummingbirds, whizzes through the air curiously hovering right in front of humans who ponder them. The first time Mike Parr, president of the American Bird Conservancy, saw one, it was feeding on blossoms of a lemon tree in California. It was just one of those other-worldly sites. It was almost like a religious experience, says Parr with awe and reverence. When they just turn their head and suddenly their throat catches the light  it lights up with this amazing color. Its just magical, really. It just lights up like a beacon. They are one of the smallest hummingbirds at just over 3 inches long- but one of the feistiest. They fly an astonishing 3,900 miles (one-way) from Alaska where they live in the summer to Mexico- one of the longest migratory journeys of any bird in the world compared to its body size, according to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. Californians enjoy them in the spring and Rocky Mountain residents in the fall as the birds feed on flower nectar and tiny insects in high mountain meadows, backyard flowers and hummingbird feeders. But the Rufous hummingbird, like hundreds of other species, is teetering on the edge. The Rufous hummingbird lost two-thirds of its population since 1970, according to the 2022 State of the Birds report. These tiny creatures are one of 70 bird species on the Tipping Point list that will lose another fifty percent of their populations in the same time frame if conservation doesnt improve. That list includes such flying beauties as the Golden-winged warbler with its stunning yellow cap and black mask. The reasons, scientists say, are multi-fold: habitat loss from climate change and human development, glass collisions, invasive species (domestic cats) and pesticides; many of the same reasons all wildlife globally have plummeted. So why should we care that birds are disappearing? One reason, says Parr, is their losses are a harbinger of what human beings face too. Birds are the canary in the coal mine, says Parr. Were seeing evidence of some ecological collapse in North America as evidenced by loss of birds. Birds rely on nature just as we do  for the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat, says Parr. As they lose habitat- from large stands of native forest, to open meadows, wetlands and marshes we too are losing those resources. So as things start to unravel, if biological diversity and climate change both unravel simultaneously, the natural world around us that we depend on so much may not be as dependable as wed like it to be. A second reason- birds are essential to our ecosystem. They pollinate flowers and disperse seeds. They eat insects and rodents keeping those populations in check. Third, they are just beautiful- filling our sky with bird song although a little less every year. We dont want to see birds disappear. So, rather than waiting until the last second, from a conservationist point of view- you just dont want to see the bird get there in the first place, Parr says. Unfortunately, wildlife doesnt have its own voice. Problem: Glass collisions Solution: Decals or bird-friendly glass Nearly 1 billion birds die every year in the United States due to collisions with glass. Birds see a reflection of sky and trees and think its habitat they can fly into. Birds not only hit high-rise office buildings but home windows as well. In fact, nearly half of all collisions occur at home windows according to the American Bird Conservancy. Collisions are most frequent during spring and especially fall migration but happen year-round. The good news is there are ways to prevent these deaths. You can add see-through decals that are peel-on/peel-off, to your windows. Most reflect ultraviolet light- which we cant see but really stands out for most birds. You dont necessarily need to put them on all your windows, says Parr. You can usually identify the windows which are the most problematic. The American Bird Conservancy has labs which have tested products and deemed them bird-friendly. Also if you are building a new home or having windows installed, you can install bird-safe glass. Many birding groups are working at the national level to promote bird-friendly building designs and lights-out nights during high migration periods. Problem: Pesticides / habitat-poor lawns Solutions: Organic gardening, planting native vegetation, setting aside wild areas Many birds eat insects, but a huge die-out of insect populations worldwide is making food scarcer. Parr says instead of pesticides and herbicides, let birds do their job to eat insects and grass seed in your garden. Birds are pretty good pesticides, says Parr. They eat a lot of insects. Encourage birds. On a larger scale, conservation groups are fighting the use of neonicotinoids or neonics  a pesticide used not only on crops but engineered into seeds and used in some backyard plants. Its preventing birds from feeding. If a bird eats the seed, there can be enough on there to actually poison the bird directly. But the bigger effect is the lack of insects. Parr says its important to look at labels when buying products for your lawn or ask landscape companies whats in the products they use. You can create more habitat for birds by planting native species and not overly tidying your yard. Birds look in little nooks and crannies for food. They like shelter- they need a place to hide from predators. Parr says that means leaving the leaves and not being so quick to take down dead wood or trees if theyre not going to cause a safety issue. Woodpeckers love them and Red-headed woodpeckers are also on the Tipping List and rapidly declining. Weve got an obsession with mowing grass and keeping everything tidy. Natures not tidy and so if you can tolerate some untidiness in your yard -maybe you can find a part of your yard that youre gonna let be native and let the grass grow a bit. Thats gonna be better for wildlife, especially if youre not using pesticides. Nature is messy. Let it be messy. Theres a beauty in there. In recent years, conservation-minded landscapers came up with new visions of what yards can look like. Theyre a far cry from the 1950s suburban green carpet look of highly manicured, water-thirsty lawns. Thats especially true out west in places like Arizona and California where theyre dealing with worsening droughts. Problem: Invasive species - outdoor cats Solution: Keep your cat indoors Free-roaming domestic cats pose serious threats to native wildlife according to multiple studies from the USDA and conservation scientists worldwide. They kill an estimated 2.4 billion birds every year in the US alone, according to the American Bird Conservancy. Multiple bird conservation groups say cat predation is by far the largest source of direct, human-caused mortality to birds. Cats and the collisions are the two that kill the most birds every year, says Parr. But we can do something about it. Keep your cat indoors. Its often quite difficult to encourage your neighbors to keep their cat indoors, but you can try. Conservation groups encourage special fencing to prevent cats from straying too far. They also recommend catios - open air patios where cats are contained. There are products you can put on cats that make it much harder for them to chase prey. Advocates are working every day to save habitat at a macro level in the US and worldwide. As a result of public/private partnerships, theyve managed to increase populations of ducks, geese and swans in the last twenty years by protecting and cleaning up watersheds and wetlands. Those moves benefit humans too, providing more water runoff areas, less flooding and cleaner ground water. You can also help fight for the survival of bird species by donating to these groups: American Bird Conservancy, National Audubon Society and International Bird Rescue. We have some responsibility to manage the planet as we found it, says Parr. Were expanding our influences, changing the nature of planet Earth and I feel like theres a responsibility we all have to not mess it up completely. Its gonna take a village, you know, everybodys got to pull their weight",21/04/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/21/world/iyw-rufous-hummingbird-tipping-point-extinction-earth-day/index.html
"For Earth Day 2023, how to put your best travel foot forward","The first Earth Day was celebrated on April 22, 1970. We mark it again this Saturday. Decades after that optimistic first event, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reminds us that global climate change has had an alarming effect on Earth and its inhabitants. Waves upon waves upon yet more waves of tourists crisscrossing the globe have helped contribute to the environmental stresses. But you dont have to totally cut out travel or stay super close to home to be a good planetary citizen. You can still tour the world and still minimize the impact on the health of our one and only (and vulnerable) planet. Check out these five ways to more gently explore the Earth: Cruising is an industry known for its carbon-discharging vessels, waste production spanning from trash to gray water and overcrowding in ports of call. However, you dont need to give up your dreams of oceanic adventure to be a good steward of the environment. Click here to find out how Hurtigruten, Ponant, Star Clippers and other cruise lines are easing pressure on the seas. You might burn some fossil fuels to get there, but once youve arrived, hiking is all about burning up calories. But where to go for an epic hike? CNN Travel has 23 of the best hikes in the world, including Camino de Santiago de Compostela (Spain), the Appalachian Trail (United States), the Basho Wayfarer (Japan) and the Lycian Way (Turkey). The infrastructure that supports the exhilarating sport of snow skiing adds its own pressures to our warming planet. Some resorts are trying to reduce their environmental impact, such as using renewable energy to run their lifts. From Val dIsere (France) and Jackson Hole (Wyoming) to Zermatt (Switzerland) and Whistler (Canada), here are 10 places where you can ski with an eased mind. Not only are bicycles easier on the environment, they let you get up close and personal with cities in a way thats just about impossible from vehicles. But not all cities that tourists enjoy are bicycle friendly. You need a city thats dedicated to getting it right to best enjoy an urban biking vacation. From Antwerp and Melbourne to Montreal and San Francisco, check out these 10 cities where bicycling works. Sometimes, Earths sheer incredible beauty and wildly varied landscapes can move us to think about better protecting the planet. And what a beautiful world it is, whether youre taking in the landscapes of lush Brazil, the green-hued charms of Ireland, the boundless sweep of Canada or the gorgeous scenery of Vietnam.",22/04/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/earth-day-2023-travel-ideas/index.html
"To my son, born in the climate crisis: I see signs of hope","Dear River, Youve only been around for three Earth Days, but your tiny lifetime has been a hell of a ride, kid. As a member of Generation Alpha (Good name! Hopeful.) I like to think youll read these letters with intent as you turn 30 in 2050. By then, youll know what became of the American experiment in the Age of Unreason and how fast the weather became unrecognizable. Since your last birthday, I watched the most expensive storm in Florida history upend lives down to the littlest, while out West, the hydrology has gone bonkers, with not enough water here and too much over there and no real plan on how to divvy it up among people who want lawns in the desert. While the American electricity made by clean sources surpassed coal-fired power for the first time, a Russian-led ground war in Europe set up a world where Saudi oil company Aramco made the second-highest annual profit in the history of humanity, just behind (checks notes) Saudi Aramco. If thats not enough to make a new Old Dad stare in the middle distance, the nation of your birth has also been torn apart by $787,500,000 worth of lies without apology and conspiracy theories around every corner. The leading cause of childhood death is now a bullet  or usually several at once  and some nights, the only thought that brings me peace is that you are half-Canadian. But one thing Ive learned as the first Chief Climate Correspondent on American television, when your beat is a hyperobject  a phenomenon so vast it exceeds human comprehension  one of the upsides is that you can choose to squint at it from an infinite number of angles on any given day. I spent the first couple years on this beat obsessing over the dark side of the human triptych in our real-life version of The Garden of Earthly Delights, while occasionally sneering at all the freaky human decadence causing our downfall in the middle  what Hieronymus Bosch called Humankind Before the Flood. But my mental health improved when I decided to spend more time between disasters over in the panel of goodness and light. One wild penguin colony or sustainable neighborhood at a time, Im trying to balance out the firehose of peer-reviewed dread by focusing less on Life As We Blew It and more on Life As We Know It Could Be. Every week, I get pitched a world with airships hauling clean fuel instead of diesel tractor trailers, and sting ray-shaped robots that sink seaweed to bury carbon instead of factory-fishing trawlers that clear-cut the sea. Your buses could bring you to school on sunlight and then help power your classrooms after dark. The worlds most abundant fuel source might be hydrogen made from sun and sea water, or little nuclear fusion stars in boxes filling batteries made of salt or minerals mined on the Asteroid Psyche. All this utopian stuff is technically feasible but, as I learned filming How To Unscrew A Planet for CNNs The Whole Story, they must also be scalable, affordable and profitable, which means our fates will be decided as much by marketers and influencers as policy makers and engineers. In a balloon over the Alps, legendary aeronaut Bertrand Piccard described how he found over 1,400 money-making, Earth-healing start-ups and tried to convince me that the answers are all around us, if only we can think like a balloonist and change our altitude and attitude by dropping the ballast of wasteful ideas and dirty fuels. But we still need dirty fuels to build all this new stuff and in your third year on Earth, we were just starting to wrap our heads around the trillion-ton problem of moving generations-worth of excess carbon out of sea and sky and back into the rock and seabed where it came from. We have to build the oil industry in reverse! Marty Odlin told me, sitting on a bucket on a dock in Maine as the fisherman/scientist gave me my metaphor for a show about planet-cooking CO2. Its a Godzilla, he said. Its burning forests down. Its stealing our fish. Its devastating our crops. Its hurting our farmers. All the stuff thats free and fun is getting ruined. We should get mad and go kill that thing. Right? Marty just wanted to be a fisherman growing up, but when he realized that the Gulf of Maine was too warm and acidic for his sons to ever consider the same, he started an ocean repair company to go hunting for Carbon Godzilla. Running Tide, which uses the natural carbon-sucking power of oysters and kelp, is among the finalists for the $100 million Carbon XPRIZE, funded by Elon Musk. Back when there were just a few Teslas on the road, I went to interview Musk in his modest garage headquarters on a side street in San Carlos, California, and I still remember the snap in my neck the first time I punched the Roadsters pedal. But who could have known this guy would go on to launch his car into space for the LOLs, supplant GM and Toyota in profits and cause reputable news organizations to flee Twitter? Fifteen years later, I went back to that San Carlos street, and next door to Teslas old garage I met the founders of Ebb Carbon, another startup in the running for Musks $100 million Carbon XPRIZE. Their Model A is a machine that fixes the chemistry of water coming out of desalination plants, making the ocean less acidic while accelerating its ability to lock away carbon as bicarbonate. That form of storage is stable for 10,000 years in the ocean, Ebbs CTO Matthew Eisamen told me. And thats a big reason for why were taking this approach is thats basically the natural way the Earth regulates CO2. They say their machine can capture 100 tons of Carbon Godzilla a year, at a current cost of over $1,000 a ton. We need to get to billions of tons per year, Eisamen said. And we anticipate that this will, at scale, be one of the lowest cost approaches, much less than the magic $100 per ton. But while Ebb just received $20 million in fresh investments, they are metaphorical toddlers at the starting line of a race to build a trillion dollar decarbonization industry in less time than it takes for an ice shelf collapse. And even if they somehow reach Tesla-like growth, science warns that the world will need hundreds of Ebbs to flourish in your lifetime to beat Carbon Godzilla. Which is why, in your third year on Earth, more people began talking in earnest about figuring out a way to turn down the sun. We call it climate intervention, Kelly Wanser told me as we sat under bluebird skies and the Washington Monument. Other people call it solar radiation management or geoengineering, and while the very idea touched off a fierce scientific debate, she left life as a systems expert in Silicon Valley to convince lawmakers and CEOs that humanity may be forced to mimic the cooling power of a volcano, so we should probably start studying the stratosphere now, just in case. Ever since the ash of the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption blew into the stratosphere and cooled the planet by half a degree Celsius for more than a year, scientists have wondered if the effect could be duplicated by aircraft spraying enough sulfur dioxide or dust made of chalk or even diamonds to cool the Earth by a degree or two. At the University of Washington, they are trying to come up with an asthma inhaler the size of an airplane to mist seawater over land and sea to advance the field of marine cloud brightening. If properly scaled, the thinking goes that you could cool the Gulf of Mexico before hurricane season, or shade the Great Barrier Reef long enough to grow stronger coral. In the United Arab Emirates, they are even using drone-borne lasers to bring rain to the desert. But the reality is that we have no idea what works in the stratosphere, because we understand so little about the part of the sky twice as high up as our flights to Grandmas. Chinese spy balloon scandals dont help. A lot more has been invested in the technology for helping determine like what shoes you want to buy than what the climate system is going to do, Wanser said. In February, NOAA launched their first SABRE mission and sent pilots in space suits up to 60,000 feet above Alaska to take the first measurements of the stratosphere in decades. Their new tools will be a rare first glimpse into how the debris from wildfires, volcanoes and rocket exhaust is slowing, speeding or masking the rate of global warming. River, your great grandparents were alive from the Wright Brothers to the Space Shuttle, but as the Earth unravels and artificial intelligence rises faster than our imaginations, their 20th century rate of changes-per-lifetime will seem as quaint as the butter churn. So far, it feels like your future will be marked in new stories to frame our wants and needs, and new tools to build Life As We Know It Could Be. How it goes will depend on the wisdom and intent of the people wielding them, and how fast we grow or shrink Carbon Godzilla. Does this fill your Old Man with more wonder or worry? Depends on the day.",23/04/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/23/us/climate-crisis-earth-day-weir-letter/index.html
"Fact check: Trump? latest false climate figure is off by more than 1,000 times","Former President Donald Trump keeps using wildly inaccurate figures to minimize the threat of climate change. Trump, now a presidential candidate, has argued in speeches and interviews that the risk of nuclear war is a much more important issue than climate change. He is entitled to his opinion. But he has repeatedly defended that opinion by citing imaginary statistics on the extent to which sea levels are expected to rise in the future. In a Fox interview this month, Trump echoed a claim he made in his campaign launch speech in November. He said on Fox: When I listen to people talk about global warming, that the ocean will rise, in the next 300 years, by 1/8th of an inch  and they talk about, This is our problem. Our big problem is nuclear warming, but nobody even talks about it. The environmentalists talk about all this nonsense. In a podcast interview that aired last week, Trump used a figure even smaller than 1/8th of an inch over 300 years: When I see these people talking about global warming, where the ocean will rise by 1/100th of an inch over the next 350 years... Facts First: Trumps claims about sea levels are not remotely close to accurate. As the federal National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has noted, the global sea level is currently rising at about 1/8th of an inch per year. In other words, the sea level rise Trump claimed people say will happen over 300 years is actually happening annually. NOAA says that, along the United States coastline in particular, sea level rise is expected to average a total of 10 to 12 inches between 2020 and 2050 alone. That means NOAA expects an average increase in the US sea level that is 80 to 96 times bigger, over just 30 years, than the 1/8th of an inch increase Trump suggested has been projected over 300 years. And NOAAs estimate for US sea level rise over those 30 years is 1,000 to 1,200 times bigger than the 1/100th of an inch figure Trump cited on the podcast last week for the next 350 years. Gary Griggs, a University of California, Santa Cruz professor of earth and planetary sciences who studies sea level rise, said in an email on Friday that Trumps claims can only be described as totally out of touch with reality...simply untrue. He said Trump has no idea what he is talking about. Sea levels rise by different amounts in different locations. For the US, sea levels are expected to rise particularly fast for the east coast and Gulf of Mexico coast  and Florida, which is bordered by both coasts, is expected to be affected more severely than many other coastal states. Trumps claims about sea levels are highly inaccurate for his own home in Florida, the Mar-a-Lago resort on the Atlantic. Even in an optimistic scenario where global warming is limited to 2 degrees Celsius, the sea level near Mar-a-Lago is expected to rise nearly 3 feet by 2150 relative to 1995-2014 levels, according to a NASA projection tool that incorporates the latest climate science. Thats a projected increase of more than 3,500 times Trumps 1/100th of an inch figure, and in about half the time period  roughly 150 years versus Trumps 300 years. Sea levels could rise much faster with more warming. Under a scenario with high emissions and a rapid collapse of ice sheets, NOAA says the contiguous US could see a sea level increase of 7.2 feet over 2000 levels by 2100 and an increase of 13 feet over 2000 levels by 2150. Trump has for years dishonestly dismissed the existence and impact of climate change. In a speech at a conservative conference last year, after saying that the oceans may rise, over the next 300 years, 1/100th of an inch, he joked, Giving you slightly more seafront property. In reality, rising sea levels are expected to have devastating consequences not only for many seafront properties but for areas further inland  rendering some communities uninhabitable and others more dangerous, increasing the frequency and reach of flooding, making hurricanes more destructive, and damaging infrastructure and ecosystems.",24/04/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/24/politics/fact-check-trump-sea-levels-ocean-climate-change/index.html
Environmental hero? mission to save the most over-fished sea in the world,"Famous for its crystal blue hues, sweeping beaches and unspoilt coves, the Turquoise Coast is one of Turkeys natural wonders. Stretching more than 600 miles along the Mediterranean, the countrys southwest shore has long been heralded for its beauty, attracting tourists from around the world. But while the sparkling waters look inviting, life under the surface is less so. In recent decades, the area has become severely nature-depleted due to overfishing, illegal fishing, tourism development and climate change. Critical habitat for loggerhead turtles and endangered Mediterranean monk seals has been destroyed, breeding grounds for sandbar sharks threatened, and native fish populations decimated. An effort to revive the area is underway, thanks in part to Zafer Kizilkaya, president and founder of Akdeniz Koruma Dernegi (the Mediterranean Conservation Society). He is credited with successfully lobbying the Turkish government to build a network of marine protected areas (MPA) spanning more than 300 miles along the Mediterranean coast. Today, Kizilkaya was awarded the prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize for his work to protect the ocean. The annual award is given to six grassroots environmental leaders, each working in a different continent. Kizilkayas mission began in 2007, following a diving expedition in Gokova Bay, a 62-mile-long gulf in the center of the Turquoise Coast. He had returned to his native Turkey after several years working as a marine researcher and underwater photographer in Indonesia and was shocked by the marine degradation. This was meant to be one of the most biodiverse parts of the Turkish coast, but it was barren, he tells CNN. It was like a nuclear war had happened underwater: there was no life, rocks were bare, there was no macroalgae, he says. Much of the Turquoise Coast and the Mediterranean has experienced a similar decline. According to the UNs Food and Agriculture Organization, the Mediterranean is the worlds most overfished sea, teeming with industrial-scale fishing fleets such as purse seiners and trawlers. Wiping out marine life has damaged the livelihoods of local fishers. Small scale fishing communities were in a panic, says Kizilkaya. Realizing the extent of the problem, he decided that this was the moment to act, and set about trying to convince local fishers and other stakeholders that no-take zones and protected areas could help to reverse these trends. Getting fishers on side was the biggest challenge, he admits, but because of the dire situation some started to listen. In 2012, Kizilkaya established Turkeys first community-managed MPA in Gokova Bay. But for the protected area to work no-fishing zones must be effectively enforced, explains Kizilkaya. He trained local fishers as marine rangers who could monitor the waters for illegal fishing and send alerts to the Turkish Coast Guard. While they did not have powers of arrest, locals were equipped with bodycams that could provide admissible evidence for court cases. As the Mediterranean has warmed due to climate change, invasive tropical fish such as lionfish have swum in via the Suez Canal. They pose a threat to the ecosystem, as they prey on native species, overgraze vegetation and have few predators themselves. To tackle this Kizilkaya took a novel approach, reaching out to some of Turkeys famous chefs and setting them the challenge of creating delicious recipes with invasive fish as the key ingredient. He promoted the recipes, encouraging restaurants across Turkey to start serving dishes such as lionfish ceviche and lionfish and chips. We became a fishmonger, says Kizilkaya, adding that the AKD continues to sell tasty, cheap lionfish caught by local fishers to restaurants. Thanks to his work, Gokova Bays marine ecosystem has made a tremendous comeback. According to ocean conservation charity Blue Marine Foundation, the number of fish per square meter has increased tenfold since the implementation of no take zones in 2012 and incomes for local fishers have increased 400%. Gokova Bay became a great example for conservation, says Kizilkaya, adding that his success helped him persuade the Turkish government to expand the MPA network southeastward along 310 miles of Turkish coastline. Kizilkaya hopes that the Goldman Environmental Prize will add momentum to his mission. Hed like to see MPAs established across Turkey and the entire Mediterranean, and he hopes his work has opened peoples eyes to the crisis underwater and what we can do to solve it. The oceans are so neglected because nobodys putting their head under the water, he says. This system works for the benefit of fish, sharks, monk seals and humans. If this is doable here, why not other places?",24/04/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/24/world/goldman-environmental-prize-zafer-kizilkaya-turkey/index.html
These are the places most at risk from record-breaking heat waves as the planet warms,"Dangerous, record-breaking heat waves are set to increase as the climate crisis intensifies, and they will be particularly devastating in countries and regions that are least prepared for them, according to a new study. Scientists analyzed temperature data sets spanning more than 60 years, as well as climate models, to calculate the likelihood of unprecedented heat extremes occurring  and where these might happen. They identified Afghanistan, Papua New Guinea and Central America  including Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua  as hot spots for high-risk heat waves. These regions are particularly vulnerable due to their fast-growing populations and limited access to healthcare and energy supplies, which undermine their resilience to extreme temperatures, according to the report, published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications. Theres evidence there that those regions may well be in for a big heat wave and they wouldnt be prepared for it, said Dann Mitchell, a professor in atmospheric sciences at the University of Bristol in the UK and a study co-author. The threat facing Afghanistan is particularly stark, Mitchell told CNN. Not only is there high potential for record-breaking extreme heat, but the impacts will be intensified by the huge difficulties the country already faces, he said. Afghanistan is struggling with dire social and economic problems. It also has a growing population which is increasingly exposed to the problems of limited resources, according to the report. When a really extreme heat wave does finally come along, then there are instantly going to be a lot of problems, Mitchell said. Heat waves have a wide-ranging negative impact. They reduce air quality, worsen drought, increase the risk of wildfires and can lead infrastructure to buckle. They also take a heavy toll on human health, and extreme heat is one of the deadliest natural disasters. Heat stroke or heat exhaustion can trigger a wide range of dangerous symptoms, including headaches, dizziness, nausea and loss of consciousness, among others. Heat stroke is the most serious heat-related illness, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, causing body temperature to skyrocket in a matter of minutes, and can lead to permanent disability or death. Several regions have already seen unprecedented temperatures this year. In March, parts of Argentina grappled with temperatures up to 10 degrees Celsius, or 18 degrees Fahrenheit, above normal, while high temperature records were smashed across large parts of Asia in April. Heat waves and other extreme weather events will only become more intense as the world continues to burn fossil fuels, said Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change at Imperial College London, who was not involved with the study. Nowhere is safe, noted the report, which found that statistically implausible heat waves  those that fell well outside the historical norm  occurred between 1959 and 2021 in around 30% of the regions assessed. These include the 2021 Pacific Northwest heat wave, where high temperature records were not just broken but completely smashed, killing hundreds of people. In Lytton, British Columbia, temperatures peaked at just under 50 degrees Celsius (121 degrees Fahrenheit) in June 2021, breaking the previous record by almost 5 degrees. The village was almost completely destroyed by a wildfire just days later. Scientists determined that the event would have been almost impossible without climate change. Parts of China, including Beijing, and European countries, such as Germany and Belgium, also face a high risk, according to the report. The millions of people who live in these densely populated regions could be badly affected by heat waves, even if these countries are more likely to have resources to mitigate some of the worst impacts. The report calls on governments around the world to prepare for heat events that go far beyond current record temperatures, such as setting up cooling centers and reducing hours for those working outside. Many policies exist that governments can implement to save lives, Otto said, including preparing heat wave management plans, ensuring and testing they are implemented, informing the public about imminent heat waves, and protecting people who are vulnerable to the impacts of heat waves. Unprecedented heat events are becoming more likely as the world continues to burn fossil fuels, said Lucas Vargas Zeppetello, a research fellow at Harvard University, whose 2022 research found that dangerous levels of heat are set to at least triple across the world by the end of the century. By definition, we dont know what could happen if large populations are exposed to unprecedented heat and humidity stress, Vargas Zeppetello told CNN, but heat waves in the past few decades have already been extremely deadly and there is serious cause for concern in the future.",25/04/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/25/world/heatwaves-temperature-record-climate-intl/index.html

Fox News?conservative politics are much larger than Tucker Carlson,"Fox News had plenty of reasons to get rid of Tucker Carlson. What happens now is arguably important not just for Fox, but for the country. The network holds great power in conservative power circles, and it either influences or amplifies the direction of the Republican Party, depending on your perspective. Just one glaring recent example of this power is that after Carlson asked for unfettered access to Capitol Hill security footage of the January 6 insurrection, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy gave it to him. That Carlson used the tapes to create a false impression of January 6, 2021, drew criticism even from notable Republicans like Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, long a target of Carlsons flippant put-downs. By the way, text messages uncovered as part of the lawsuit also show that other Fox personalities, like Sean Hannity, were in contact with and advising White House officials in the Trump administration on January 6. From the flag-wrapped post-9/11 period to now, a rotating cast of nighttime anchors has represented different eras. Carlson, once a magazine writer in the mold of George Will, has since mainlined conspiracy theories about the Covid vaccine, embraced an almost anti-government libertarian outlook and encouraged viewers to see themselves as victims of oppression. The cleanest take I saw after Carlsons ouster came from CNNs Oliver Darcy, who noted that Fox hosts come and go, and their power is linked to their platform. It is pretty much enshrined as a law of physics in the universe of right-wing media that whoever the Murdochs put in prime time will rate, Darcy wrote. Anyone remember Bill OReilly? While that former Fox anchor does have a show  it streams on Youtube  he certainly does not play the same role in the political conversation that he did as a Fox host until 2017. Carlson assumed OReillys time slot. Carlson is that rare anchor who has now been on all three major cable news networks  CNN, MSNBC and Fox. He also once hosted a program on PBS. He is, in short, the ultimate professional pundit who has shapeshifted over the course of his decades in front of very different audiences on television. Text messages privately acknowledging he knew Trumps election lies were lies unmasked him. But what remains to be seen is whether he will seek to carry the torch for the same audience without the oxygen of a TV show or whether he will shift once more. Carlson will test the hypothesis that Fox News as a brand trumps any single personality, Darcy wrote, adding that Carlson could conceivably turn up elsewhere and command an audience, particularly since Trump has been feuding with the Murdochs who oversee Fox. More important than Carlsons next act will be who the network picks for its prime platform in the most overtly opinionated portion of their programming. CNNs Allison Morrow notes that Fox will need a Carlson upgrade of some kind because upstart conservative networks want into the same space. I watched the first episode of the post-Carlson 8 p.m. ET hour on Fox, and if it is any indication, there wont be much new in the politics that are pushed on Foxs viewers. After a few words about Carlson came a solid bloc of Joe Biden bashing. Fill-in host Brian Kilmeade launched into a report about how an FBI agent who has sought whistleblower protection presents a big problem for the Democratic Party. They want to bury the story. We do not, Kilmeade said, intentionally or not placing himself and Fox as the we opposite Democrats. There was also a long montage of clips cut to make fun of Bidens age and repeated mention of an IRS official who has asked for whistleblower protection to discuss Bidens son Hunter. The longshot Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy said Bidens advisers are part of the the administrative state, the managerial class and they were perpetrating elder abuse by allowing Biden to run. Its the managerial class versus the everyday citizen, Ramaswamy said of current American life. Ramaswamy also plugged his new book, which argues that Democrats and capitalists are, somehow, circumventing the Constitution with socially-minded policies known as ESG, or environmental, social and governance investing. Note: Republicans in the House and Senate, along with a few Democrats, have fought the Biden administration over a policy that allows retirement fund managers to consider the impact of climate change and social factors when picking investments. The evolution of the GOP from the party expected to protect corporations, also evident in Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis war with Disney, is clearly progressing. From there, it was on to a report about how, according to Kilmeade, the crime epidemic under Joe Biden is completely out control. Without ever mentioning the possibility that the availability of guns might have something to do with fears of gun violence, the reporter talked about people investing in bulletproofing their cars. On-screen, the words were Bidens Legacy: Crime in the Cities. Related: Heres a CNN Fact Check on the crime in Manhattan, which far below record levels. After declaring crime to be Bidens legacy, Kilmeade transitioned. Meanwhile, another legacy of Joe Bidens first term is how he has completely destroyed the border, Kilmeade said, throwing to commercial. Interviewing a sheriff from Arizona, Kilmeade asked about recent elections in which Arizonans elected a Democratic governor and two Democratic senators. Does that say the people of Arizona dont care? Kilmeade asked. After immigration, the show turned to foreign policy and the unrest in Sudan. Rep. Michael Waltz, a Republican who represents Florida in Congress, told Kilmeade the Biden administrations foreign policy has the whole world on fire. The situation in Sudan, Kilmeade said, is obviously reminding a lot of people of Preisdent Bidens disastrous exit from Afghanistan. Note: This, actually, could represent a pivot from Carlson, who has grown increasingly and vocally opposed to US involvement in world affairs, particularly with regard to Russia. After a segment criticizing weight loss surgery for severely obese teens, it was back to climate change and criticism of a New York Times op-ed regarding meat and climate. The guest, climate change denier Marc Morano, seemed to make a Nazi reference by invoking the anti-fascist speeches of the German Pastor Martin Niemoller. While Niemoller was trying to make points about complacency during the rise of Nazis, Moranos version of the words were about his opposition to curbing carbon emissions. First they came for your energy. Then they came for your gas powered cars, your freedom of movement, your cheap flights. And now theyre coming for your food, Morano said, suggesting New York Mayor Eric Adams would eventually try to outlaw the consumption of meat when in fact he has only pledged to limit the spending of city funds on it. Theyre going after our modern diet, Morano said. You will eat nothing to be happy according to this plan. And thus, the diet fed to Fox viewers is unlikely to change, even without its biggest star.",25/04/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/25/politics/tucker-carlson-what-matters/index.html
"Biden and South Korea? Yoon announce agreement to deter North Korea, including deploying nuclear-armed submarine","President Joe Biden and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol announced a key new agreement at the White House on Wednesday that aims to deter North Korean aggression, including a new US commitment to deploy a nuclear-armed submarine in South Korea for the first time since the early 1980s. In a joint news conference at the White House Biden hailed what he called the ironclad alliance between the two countries. The alliance formed in war and has flourished in peace, Biden said from the Rose Garden at the White House. Our mutual defense treaty is iron clad and that includes our commitment to extend a deterrence  and that includes the nuclear threat, the nuclear deterrent. Theyre particularly important in the face of DPRKs increased threats and the blatant violation of US sanctions, Biden added. The product of monthslong discussions between officials from both countries, the new agreement will say that the US (intends) to take steps to make our deterrence more visible through the regular deployment of strategic assets, including a US nuclear ballistic submarine visit to South Korea, which has not happened since the early 1980s, the official said. Officials made clear that such assets will not be stationed permanently, and there is no plan to deploy any tactical nuclear weapons to the Korean peninsula. The bottom line here is theres even closer cooperation, closer consultation and, and were not going to be stationing nuclear weapons on the peninsula, but we will have visits to ports, visits of nuclear submarines and things like that, Biden said as he heralded the agreement, which he called a prudent step to reinforce extended deterrence. The decision to strengthen extended deterrence  a US policy that uses the full range of military capabilities to defend its allies and position additional American nuclear resources in the region amounts to an acknowledgment that attempts to deter North Korea from advancing its own nuclear program have stalled. Attempts at diplomacy with dictator Kim Jong Un have gone mostly unanswered as the North escalates its missile tests and potentially prepares for another nuclear test. Biden offered a stark warning to Kim in the press conference. A nuclear attack by North Korea against the United States or its allies and partners is unacceptable, and will result in the end of whatever regime were to take such an action, Biden said. It was direct notice to the North Korean dictator that the United States would defend its treaty ally to his south, and precisely the type of message Yoon arrived in Washington hoping to hear. Sustainable peace on the Korean Peninsula does not happen automatically, Yoon said, Our two leaders have decided to significantly strengthen extended deterrence of our two countries against North Koreas nuclear and missile threats so that we can achieve peace through the superiority of overwhelming forces and not a false peace based on the goodwill of the other side. Biden welcomed Yoon to the White House for the full pomp and circumstance and hospitality of an official state visit  a high-stakes meeting amid ongoing provocations from North Korea, Chinas growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region and a recent leak of Pentagon documents. As he welcomed Yoon, Biden called the alliance the linchpin of regional security and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific. And more broadly, the visit signals the importance with which the US views its relationships with allies in the Indo-Pacific, this trip coming one week before Biden hosts Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos and weeks before Biden is expected to travel to the region himself. In the news conference the President also noted the trilateral relationship between US, South Korea and Japan, praising President Yoons efforts. I want to thank you again Mr. President for your political courage and personal commitment to diplomacy with Japan, Biden said. Biden and Yoon unveiled the Washington Declaration, a set of new steps to boost US-South Korean cooperation on military training, information sharing and strategic asset movements in the face of a recent spate of missile launches from North Korea. It is intended to send a clear message: What the United States and the ROK plan to do at every level is strengthen our practices, our deployments, our capabilities, to ensure the deterrent message is absolutely unquestioned and to also make clear that if we are tested in any way that we will be prepared to respond collectively and in an overwhelming way, a senior administration official said. The declaration includes the deployment of the nuclear ballistic submarine. Additionally, the US and Korea will also strengthen our training, our exercises and simulation activities to improve the US-ROK alliances approach to deterring and defending against North Korean threats, per the official. It also creates the US-ROK Nuclear Consultative Group, which the official said will convene regularly to consult on nuclear and strategic planning issues, with the hope that it will give allies additional insight in how we think about planning for major contingencies. That group is modeled after US engagement with European allies during the height of the Cold War, the official said. After a year in which North Korea fired a record number of nuclear missile tests, South Koreas President Yoon earlier this year spoke about possibly deploying US tactical missiles on the Korean peninsula or even developing the countrys own set of nuclear weapons. i While he dialed back his remarks, those are both scenarios the Biden administration wanted deeply to avoid, and White House officials spent recent months looking for ways to reassure South Korea by bolstering the alliance, including considering a plan to incorporate nuclear exercises into the war planning the two nations already do together, according to two senior Biden administration officials. We need to have tabletop exercises that go through a variety of scenarios, including possibly nuclear weapons, a senior official told CNN earlier this month. The South Koreans dont have experience in using nuclear weapons. This is why we need to do tabletop exercises with them. The Koreans need to be educated in what it means to use nuclear weapons, the targeting, and the effects, said David Maxwell of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, adding that there will be no change to the US having control on the targeting. The hope is that this will satisfy them and improve readiness. The hope, the officials said, was that this offer  along with sustained engagement to develop other ideas to implement  will provide the alternative that the South Koreans need. Beyond the declaration, Biden and Yoon are celebrating 70 years of the US-South Korea alliance, highlighting close economic ties between the nations, pointing to cooperation on issues like climate change and the Covid-19 pandemic, and looking toward ways to continue supporting Ukraine amid Russias ongoing invasion, plus a new dialogue on cyber cooperation. They are also expected to announce a new student exchange program focused on STEM that will significantly increase the number of students going in both directions, a second senior official said. And Biden praised Yoon for his courageous, principled diplomacy with Japan, saying it has strengthened our trilateral relationship and makes an enormous difference. A stronger alliance between those two countries is strategically important to the US as it looks for ways to counter Chinas rising influence. Recent online leaks of Pentagon documents involving South Korea also loom over the visit. One of the leaked documents describes, in remarkable detail, a conversation between two senior South Korean national security officials about concerns by the countrys National Security Council over a US request for ammunition. The officials worried that supplying the ammunition, which the US would then send to Ukraine, would violate South Koreas policy of not supplying lethal aid to countries at war. According to the document, one of the officials then suggested a way of getting around the policy without actually changing it  by selling the ammunition to Poland. The document sparked controversy in Seoul. The leaks caused the press to push him (Yoon) more on this. And were hearing more and more about how he feels about the issue, Dr. Victor Cha, Korea chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said in a recent briefing. Cha continued, Korea has one of the largest, if not the largest, stockpile of munitions of any country in the world. And they also have tremendous production capacity in terms of munitions. And if theres one thing that Ukraine needs in this war and that NATO allies who are supporting Ukraine need in this war, its munitions. So I would say to watch this space, adding that it is unlikely that an announcement will be made during this state visit. And the White House emphatically stated Tuesday that US commitment to its security partnership with South Korea is ironclad despite those leaks, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre declining to say whether it would be a topic of discussion between Biden and Yoon. Pressed during the press conference on whether the leaks came up, Yoon declined to say. We are communicating between our two countries and we are sharing necessary information. I believe that investigation is underway in the United States. Various and complex variables are always in play. We need time to wait for the investigation results by the United States and we plan to continue to communicate on the matter, Yoon said, via a translator. More broadly, Russias war in Ukraine is expected to be a key topic of discussion, with both leaders expected to continue to promote the importance of democracy, and a fulsome conversation expected on what comes next for Koreas support for Ukraine, a third official said. Ultimately, theres no country that has probably a better sense of the importance of the international community standing together to support a country thats completely invaded than the ROK, the second senior official said. Wednesdays events mark just the second state visit of the Biden presidency (Biden hosted French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte in December 2022). The visit began informally Tuesday as the Bidens welcomed Yoon and his wife, Mrs. Kim Keon Hee, for an evening trip to the Korean War Memorial. The South Korean guests were formally received with an official arrival ceremony Wednesday morning on the South Lawn ahead of a bilateral meeting with the presidents and their staffs, followed by a joint press conference. In remarks at the arrival ceremony, Biden acknowledged the attendance of Korean War veterans from both the US and South Korea as he commemorated 70 years of the alliance on the White House South Lawn, where nearly 7,000 attendees gathered Wednesday morning. Those veterans are the reason that we stand here today, two vibrant, innovative democracies standing strong and free because of them, he said to applause, calling the alliance an unbreakable bond forged in bravery. The president recalled his visit Tuesday to the Korean War Memorial with Yoon, where they honored the service of the late Medal of Honor recipient Corporal Luther Story, who was killed in action during the war. Biden and Yoon met with Storys niece, Judy Wade, Tuesday evening. Storys remains were recently identified using new technology. There will be full pageantry and glamour in the evening as the White House rolls out the red carpet for the leaders, their spouses and key dignitaries at the black-tie state dinner. The elaborate dinner is the result of weeks of careful diplomatic preparations, with each detail meticulously planned by a team of White House chefs, social staff, and protocol experts. Ties between the countries will be front and center in the decor and on the menu, with guests set to dine under towering cherry blossom branches on food prepared by Korean American celebrity chef Edward Lee. The menu includes crab cakes with a gochujang vinaigrette, braised beef short ribs, and a deconstructed banana split with lemon bar ice cream and a doenjang caramel. Entertainment will be provided by a trio of Broadway stars. Yoon also joined Vice President Kamala Harris for lunch, and toured NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland with her Tuesday, where the leaders committed to increase cooperation on space exploration. And he is set to address a joint session of Congress on Thursday. A senior administration official noted that some of the last remaining veterans of the Korean War from both Korea and the United States would join in Wednesdays proceedings. The visit is also an opportunity to reinforce the Biden-Yoon friendship. National security adviser Jake Sullivan said the leaders have developed a rapport that has seen four engagements to date, including Bidens trip to Seoul in May 2022 just days after Yoon took office, as well as on the sidelines of summits in Spain, New York and Cambodia.",26/04/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/26/politics/biden-yoon-south-korea-state-visit/index.html
"How Colombia? Petro, a former leftwing guerrilla, found his opening in Washington","An eternal rule in hospitality is that awkward discussions must be avoided at all costs  at least until it is time for dessert. You dont want your guests to have a bad taste in their mouth before dinner is served. The same rule could well be applied in politics, as leaders often focus first on common ground with their counterparts rather than taking on a confrontational stance face-to-face. Last week, as US president Joe Biden welcomed his Colombian counterpart Gustavo Petro  a former leftwing guerrilla and frequent critic of US international engagement  at the White House, the two men did just that, touting their commonalities and glossing over differences. The meeting came as a series of diplomatic visits shone light on Latin America as a strategic region, with Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov touring Brazil, Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba  and as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed Mexicos parliament, pleading for support. In regional heavyweight Brazil, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has meanwhile been pushing for a coalition of non-aligned nations to resolve the Ukraine crisis, and courting Beijing as an economic partner. So what was the most solid common ground President Biden, as host, could find for his guest? Climate change. The most significant message out of Washington during Petros visit was not directed to Petro, but to the entire Latin American region, with the Biden administration pledging up to $500 million  pending congressional approval  to an international Amazon conservation fund set up by Brazil back in 2008 and which had failed to attract much interest, let alone donations, in recent years. The Amazon rainforest spans across nine South American countries, so the impact of the fund has truly a regional dimension. And Bidens commitment is a ten-fold increase from what the US pledged just two months ago, when it was Lulas turn at the Oval Office. The announcement signals that the Biden administration is listening carefully to the messages coming from Latin America, where fighting climate change has long been a priority for governments on both left and right. Leaders from the region tend to see the climate issue as their platform in international summits. Timed to coincide with Petros visit, the funding pledge also hints that the Colombian leader has found his opening in the current competition between the worlds superpowers. Like many countries in Latin America, Colombia has received considerable investments from Chinese companies in recent years, mostly in the transport and mining sectors. A Chinese consortium will build the subway system in Colombias capital Bogota  one of the most strategic infrastructure projects in the country over the next two decades. In January, a note from the Russian Ambassador to Colombia praised Petros decision not to send any Russian-made weapons owned by Colombia to the Ukrainian armed forces, a similar position to that of other countries in the region such as Argentina, Brazil and Peru who have resisted entering the coalition of Western powers in support of Ukraine. Petro understood that he can develop a pendulum strategy, switching from one side to the other at the same time, says Vicente Torrijos, a professor of international studies at the Colombian War College. That Colombia is able, without losing the benefits of being a strategic ally of NATO, to interact with Moscow and Beijing, its a very pragmatic vision of international geopolitics, Torrijos told CNN. On Thursday, Petro also called on Biden to launch a new Alliance for Progress to promote economic development through cleaner energy in the Americas  invoking the 1960s program led by former US President John F. Kennedy. Becoming a voice for climate action internationally would align with Petros personal ambitions. Petro has the aspiration of leading the new phase of Latin Americas geopolitics. Speaking of generations, [Mexican president Andres Manuel] Lopez Obrador is on the way out, Lula already had his own moment, and on the other side [Chiles president Gabriel] Boric is very young, very immature... so Petro sees that theres a leadership gap in the Americas progressive front, and aspires to fill it, Torrijos told CNN. And Biden can also tout a considerable concession from his meeting with Petro, who had always refused to condemn Russias actions in Ukraine  until now. The joint statement signed by both leaders last week condemned all forms of authoritarianism and aggression in the world, including Russias violation of Ukraines territorial integrity contrary to international law, a considerable change in rhetoric from Petros normal discourse. Both leaders are showing some real pragmatism, and Petro knows he can be pragmatic when he wants to, said Sergio Guzman, the director of Colombia Risk Analysis, a political consultancy in Bogota. Petro has shown he wants to be an international leader and to represent Latin America in these big contexts, and the Biden administration was ready to recognize him as such. In that sense, condemning the war on Ukraine was not a price too high to pay, Guzman told CNN.",27/04/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/27/americas/petro-biden-colombia-climate-intl-latam-analysis/index.html
"Catastrophic drought that? pushed millions into crisis made 100 times more likely by climate change, analysis finds","The unrelenting drought that has devastated the Horn of Africa and left more than 20 million people facing acute food insecurity would not have been possible without climate change, a new analysis has found. Since October 2020, this part of East Africa, one of the worlds most impoverished regions, has been gripped by its worst drought in 40 years as an unprecedented five consecutive rainy seasons have failed. The drought has brought catastrophic impacts to large areas of Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia: Tens of thousands have died, crops have shriveled, livestock have starved and chronic hunger and water insecurity are widespread and growing. In a world without human-caused climate change, this devastating drought would not have happened. Thats the conclusion of a rapid attribution study released on Thursday by the World Weather Attribution initiative. The organization is made up of a team of international scientists who, in the immediate aftermath of extreme weather events, analyze data and climate models to establish what role climate change played. In the Horn of Africa, they found that planet-heating pollution caused by burning fossil fuels has made the regions ongoing agricultural drought 100 times more likely  and thats a conservative estimate, they said. Higher temperatures have significantly increased the amount of water evaporating from plants and soils, according to the study, causing crop losses, livestock death and water shortages. The planets average temperature is now around 1.2 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial levels of the late 1800s. Without that warming, the region would not have experienced this severe agricultural drought, the report found. The scientists also looked at whether climate change was to blame for the lack of rain, but concluded there was no overall impact. The report found that while climate change makes low rainfall twice as likely during the regions long rains season, which runs from March to May, it actually makes the short rains, between October and December, wetter. The reason this wetter trend has been absent in the Horn of Africa over the last few years is because of the influence of La Nina, a natural climate phenomenon that brings dryer conditions to the region during the short rains period. Human-caused global heating is making droughts across the world longer and more extreme. The blistering drought that affected the Northern Hemisphere last summer, including large parts of the US, Europe and China, was made 20 times more likely by the climate crisis, according to an October analysis from the the World Weather Attribution group. Scientists say droughts will only become more severe if the world continues to burn fossil fuels. Regions that are already vulnerable face the worst impacts. The climate change-fueled disaster in the Horn of Africa has brought devastation to a region already suffering from a slew of problems, including global price hikes following Russias invasion of Ukraine and deadly internal conflicts. Much of the population are farmers that rely on rainfall for crops and livestock. They have been plunged even further into poverty as the rains failed. At least 8 million farm animals are estimated to have died during the drought. This has actually forced people to migrate to other regions in search of either water or pasture for their crops, or also just food for their families, said Phoebe Wafubwa, an adviser at the International Federation of Red Cross Red Crescent in Kenya. Around 1.7 million people in Ethiopia and Somalia have had to leave their homes because of the impacts of the drought, according to the report, and hunger levels are sky-high. More than 20 million people in the Horn of Africa have been pushed into crisis levels of food insecurity, or worse, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. In Somalia, which has been teetering on the edge of famine, more than 43,000 people are estimated to have been killed by the drought, half of whom were children under five years old. Almost half of countrys population is affected, over 3 million people are displaced, Mamunur Rahman Malik, the Somalia representative for the World Health Organization, told CNN. The country continues to pay the price of global warming and climate change, he added. The findings of this study show that frequent multi-year droughts compounded with heat extremes, in the main rainy season, will severely impact food security and human health in the Horn of Africa as the climate continues to warm, Joyce Kimutai, principal meteorologist and climate scientist at the Kenya Meteorological Department, said in a statement. The region is seeing some relief during the current rainy season, although it has brought flash flooding to parts of Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia. The expectation is that the drought is coming to a close, Chris Funk, director of the Climate Hazards Center at UC Santa Barbara, told CNN. But it will be a very long road to recovery. The current rains are not substantial enough to see a significant improvement to food security, Kimutai explained on a call with reporters. And the region can expect more extreme dry conditions in the future. As the world continues to warm, we expect to see the combined effect of low precipitation with (high) temperatures causing really exceptional droughts in this part of the world, she said.",27/04/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/27/africa/drought-horn-of-africa-climate-change-intl/index.html
"Almost two-thirds of elephant habitat lost across Asia, study finds","Elephants have lost almost two-thirds of their habitat across Asia, the result of hundreds of years of deforestation and increasing human use of land for agriculture and infrastructure, a new study has found. The Asian elephant, listed as endangered, is found across 13 countries in the continent but their forest and grassland habitats have been eroded by more than 64%  equating to 3.3 million square kilometers of land  since the year 1700, researchers said. The study, published Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports, compiles the work of several experts led by biologist and conservation scientist Shermin de Silva, a professor from the University of California, San Diego. The team found that large-scale habitat loss has driven up the potential for conflict between elephants and humans  a situation that shouldnt be accepted as inevitable and one that can be avoided with proper planning. My worry is that we are going to reach a tipping point in which cultures of mutual non-confrontation toward one another get replaced by cultures of antagonism and violence  by both species ... We have to de-escalate this situation, said de Silva, who is also founder and president of Trunks and Leaves a non-profit dedicated to the conservation of wild Asian elephants and their habitats. The study found that the greatest decline in elephant habitats was in China, where 94% of suitable land was lost between 1700 and 2015. That was followed by India, which lost 86%. Meanwhile, more than half of suitable elephant habitats have been lost in Bangladesh, Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesias Sumatra. Bhutan, Nepal and Sri Lanka also saw a significant decline  mostly in areas where elephants still roam today. Restoring these habitats doesnt necessarily mean keeping them static. Instead we need to better understand the role of people (rural agriculturalists, indigenous communities) who are often marginalized in the economic systems that have been put in place, de Silva said. We also need to reckon with how these dynamics can be maintained sustainably, given the current and future human population size as well as climate change. Researchers found there was an acceleration in elephant habitat loss from the year 1700, which coincided with the expansion of European colonization of the region. During this time, logging, road-building, resource extraction and deforestation ramped up, and farming became more intense on land that might otherwise have hosted wildlife. The era also saw new value systems, market forces, and governance policies reaching beyond the cities of Europe into the forests of Asia  speeding up elephant habitat loss and the fragmentation of the species, the study found. In the year 1700 an elephant might hypothetically have been able to traverse as much as 45% of the suitable area without interruption, but by 2015 this was down to just 7.5%, the authors said. India and Sri Lanka have the largest remaining wild population of elephants in South Asia. Both countries were transformed by colonial-era road-building and logging during which elephants and other wildlife were eradicated from higher elevations and lowland rainforests, which were converted to plantations and settlements, the researchers said. De Silva said the industrial revolution was followed by a second wave in the middle of the last century that drove greater habitat loss. We observed that in some places, like Thailand and China, the major losses occur following the 1950s. The colonial era had already introduced large-scale plantations in South Asia, but these later changes came from large-scale agriculture, she said. Today, humans are expanding further into wild spaces with population centers, agriculture, and extractive industries like mining. And elephants are increasingly coming into conflict with humans. In Indias eastern state of Assam, conflict with elephants dramatically increased in the 1980s, corresponding with a drop in forest cover below 30% to 40% of the landscape, the study said. Political and social issues have also played a part. During the Rohingya crisis in 2017, thousands of minority Muslim Rohingya people from Myanmar arrived in neighboring Bangladesh, fleeing a violent military campaign. About 1 million people are now living in the worlds biggest refugee camp in Coxs Bazar  in an area that was once the forest home to an elephant population. There was rapid, large-scale disruption of a trans-boundary elephant corridor at Cox Bazar between Bangladesh and Myanmar with the settlement of Rohingya refugees, the researchers said. Habitat loss also means elephants are migrating from their usual territories, creating challenges for human communities that have little experience with elephants, the study said. In 2021, millions were transfixed by a herd of elephants that migrated out of a protected area in Chinas southwest Yunnan province and trekked more than 500 kilometers (310 miles), trampling crops, roaming through towns and causing more than a million dollars worth of damage. Protected areas in Asia are small and tend to be confined to rugged terrain at higher elevations, the study said. Elephants are generally long-lived and highly adaptable. So when they lose their homes, they go searching for new ones, said de Silva. If current elephant populations are to survive, the researchers said, the practice of driving them into ever-shrinking and marginal habitat must be replaced with attempts to adequately identify and connect areas of suitable habitat.",27/04/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/27/asia/elephant-habitat-loss-asia-scn-intl-hnk/index.html
Life in the ocean? ?wilight zone?could disappear due to the climate crisis,"One of Earths largest habitats could see its rich diversity of life reduced by the end of the century due to the climate crisis. The oceans mesopelagic zone, also called the twilight zone, is located between 656 feet and 3,280 feet (200 meters to 1,000 meters) below the surface. The marine region, which accounts for approximately a quarter of the oceans volume, is home to billions of metric tons of organic matter and some of Earths most stunning biodiversity, despite being beyond the reach of sunlight. The twilight zone also a crucial habitat for marine life that dives in search of prey, like sharks, or lanternfish that hide in the twilight zone during the day and swim to the surface waters to feed at night. New research warns that the climate crisis could reduce life in the twilight zone between 20% and 40% by the end of the century. And if greenhouse gas emissions continue, the researchers estimate that the ocean regions life could be severely depleted within 150 years  and recovery may not be possible for thousands of years. Paleontologists and ocean scientists teamed up to study the impacts on the oceans twilight zone during previous ancient warming events in order to predict how the habitat may respond in the future due to global warming. The research team studied cores taken from the seafloor that included evidence of preserved microscopic shells from plankton. Over time, the calcium carbonate shells accumulate on the seafloor, preserving information about what the environment was like during their lifetime. The tiny shells effectively create a timeline of how the ocean has changed over millions of years. A study detailing the findings was published Thursday in the journal Nature Communications. We still know relatively little about the ocean twilight zone, but using evidence from the past we can understand what may happen in the future, said lead study author Dr. Katherine Crichton, a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom, in a statement. The researchers focused on two warm periods that occurred 15 million years ago and 50 million years ago, where even ocean temperatures were markedly warmer than today, according to the study. We found that the twilight zone was not always a rich habitat full of life, said study coauthor Paul Pearson, an honorary professor at Cardiff University in the United Kingdom, in a statement. In these warm periods, far fewer organisms lived in the twilight zone, because much less food arrived from surface waters. Particles of organic matter from the oceans surface drift down and serve as one of the main food sources for life in the twilight zone. But past warming events caused the material to be degraded more quickly by bacteria, so less of it reached the ocean region. Warmer ocean temperatures also increase the metabolic rates of organisms, leading to increased food demand and oxygen consumption, according to the study. The rich variety of twilight zone life evolved in the last few million years, when ocean waters had cooled enough to act rather like a fridge, preserving the food for longer, and improving conditions allowing life to thrive, Crichton said. Luiz A. Rocha, curator and Follett Chair of Ichthyology at the California Academy of Sciences, worries that changes are underway that havent been detected because the twilight zone is so understudied, largely due to a disconnect between funding and the costs of exploring this region. Rocha, who was not involved in the study, researches the twilight zone and the mesophotic zone just above it, located between 98 and 492 feet (30 and 150 meters) below the surface. There are no baseline data to compare what we are measuring against, so this study that looks at the composition of the fossil record over time is one of the few ways we can try to understand how we are causing the twilight zone to change, Rocha said. Based on what they discovered from the ancient warming events, the researchers combined that data with Earth system mode simulations  modeling of Earths carbon cycle as it moves through the land, sea and atmosphere. The teams work revealed what is currently occurring in the twilight zone and how that might change in the future across decades, centuries and even millennia as the world warms. Our findings suggest that significant changes may already be under way, Crichton said. Unless we rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, this could lead to the disappearance or extinction of much twilight zone life within 150 years, with effects spanning millennia thereafter. Even a low-emissions future may have a significant impact, but that would be far less severe than medium- and high-emissions scenarios. Our study is a first step to finding out how vulnerable this ocean habitat may be to climate warming. The researchers used three emissions scenarios based on the total carbon dioxide emissions after 2010. The low estimate was 625 billion metric tons, medium was 2,500 billion metric tons and high was 5,000 billion metric tons. The Global Carbon Budget estimates that the total global carbon dioxide emissions in 2022 was 40.6 billion metric tons. Yearly emissions have been close to that number each year since 2010, so the researchers noted that the low-estimate scenario they used has already been emitted. The team thinks the medium emissions scenario will have been reached in about 50 years, and the high estimate in just over a century. The twilight zone plays an important role in the oceans carbon cycle because most of the carbon dioxide taken up by phytoplankton ends up there as their remains sink down from the surface ocean, said study coauthor Jamie Wilson, a postdoctoral researcher at the UKs University of Liverpool, in a statement. INTERACTIVE: See whats at risk of disappearing on Earth One of the challenges of predicting how this movement of carbon might change in the future is that there are many processes to disentangle in the modern ocean. By looking back at the twilight zone in past warm periods we can identify the most important processes and use those to predict the future. We found that this natural cycling of carbon is likely already changing and may be perturbed long into the future. The climate crisis has impacted Earths oceans in the form of pollution, warming, deoxygenation, acidification and overfishing, according to the study. These effects have caused conservationists to consider different protective efforts, such as restricting harmful activities in the oceans. Protecting the twilight zone will be difficult since typical conservation efforts, such as preventing fishing or deep-sea mining, cant apply there, Rocha said. A marine protected area for the (twilight zone) makes very little sense because the impacts that are affecting it are global in nature, he said. What we really need to protect the (twilight zone) is to stop, or at least slow down, the high rate of change that we are subjecting our planets climate to.",28/04/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/28/world/twilight-zone-life-reduction-climate-scn/index.html
Manchin rails against Biden? clean energy plans as he faces tough political headwinds in West Virginia,"West Virginia political observers were not surprised when Sen. Joe Manchin appeared on Fox News on Monday to make a stunning threat: He could be persuaded to vote to repeal his own bill, the Inflation Reduction Act, if the Biden administration pushed him far enough. The conservative Democratic senator reiterated this to CNN, saying he would look for every opportunity to repeal my own bill if the administration continued to use the IRA to steer the US quickly towards the clean energy transition and away from fossil fuels. The IRA, passed and signed into law last year, was a sweeping $750 billion bill that lowered prescription drug costs, raised taxes on large corporations, and invested $370 billion into new tax credits for cleaner energy. Even though Manchin carved out space for fossil fuels, the bill represents by far the biggest climate investment in US history. From the start, Manchin has insisted the IRA was an energy security bill, rather than a clean-energy bill. Still, experts said he must be sensitive to the idea that he ushered in what ended up being the nations largest climate law, given he represents West Virginia  a state where coal and natural gas reign supreme. Manchins repeal threat was probably good politics, West Virginia University political science professor Sam Workman told CNN. If he decides to seek reelection in 2024, the 75-year-old senator will face his toughest political fight yet, as popular West Virginia Republican Gov. Jim Justice jumped into the race this week. Justices bid for the seat doesnt change anything at all, Manchin told CNN. But political experts from his home state see a man who is gearing up for a fight. Since delivering President Joe Biden one of his biggest legislative wins with the IRA last summer, Manchin has spent the last few months on a rampage against the administration, homing in on what he calls its radical climate agenda. Manchin has voted against Bidens nominees for high-ranking administration positions, bashed new rules from the Environmental Protection Agency and Treasury Department and clashed with members of the presidents cabinet at Senate hearings. Manchins appearance on Fox to slam Biden and threaten to repeal the law he had an outsized role in writing is a pretty good indicator to me that hes running, said John Kilwein, chair of West Virginia Universitys political science department. Manchin has been silent on whether hell run for reelection, but as Justice announced his candidacy, Manchin expressed confidence. Make no mistake, I will win any race I enter, he said in a statement. The Democrat beat his Republican challenger by just three percentage points in 2018. And though Justice still must get through a primary against Republican Rep. Alex Mooney, the governor is already backed by Senate Republicans electoral arm and many in the state think he will present a serious challenge to Manchin. Justice is a likable candidate  he takes that aw shucks thing to the next level, Kilwein said. This is going to be [Manchins] toughest fight, but I think anyone who thinks this is going to be a piece of cake is wrong. I dont think hes going to be easy to beat. Manchin is in danger politically, his Democratic colleague Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut told CNN. Joe Manchin is the last remaining statewide elected Democrat [in West Virginia], and we want [him] back in the United States Senate, Blumenthal said, adding Manchin was a pillar of strength to Democrats in the last session. Justice made little mention of Manchin during his official campaign launch but came out swinging against Biden and his agenda. On Friday, Justice told Fox News that Manchin would be a formidable opponent if he runs for reelection, but added that hes done some things that have really alienated an awful lot of West Virginians. There is no denying that West Virginia is incredibly conservative; the state went nearly 40 percentage points for Trump in the 2020 election. But even with those fundamentals, political experts said Manchin has had tremendous staying power through retail politics and argue he can deliver for the state while standing up to Biden. His whole appeal is a retail appeal; every blueberry festival, huckleberry festival, Joe Manchins there, former West Virginia political science professor Patrick Hickey told CNN. Hes a really smart and talented politician. He gets all the benefits that come from supporting (the IRA), but the next time hes in West Virginia, hell be in a diner telling voters how terrible Biden is. Behind the political rhetoric, the Inflation Reduction Acts energy provisions could be a windfall for West Virginia, and Manchin is walking a tightrope in his messaging around the law. Despite blasting the Biden administration, Manchin has spent the past few months at home touting the benefits of the IRA and jobs it is already bringing to the state. Several major clean energy companies have invested hundreds of millions of dollars to build new manufacturing plants in the state: a battery factory, a new industrial facility totally powered by renewable energy, and a plant to make electric school buses. The way Manchin talked about those, hes crediting the IRA and saying, see, these are the good things that have happened, said Angie Rosser, executive director of environmental group West Virginia Rivers. Those are hundreds of jobs reaching into the thousands, which for our small state is a big, big deal. Rosser and others pointed out that Manchin designed the IRA specifically to deliver money to West Virginia, designing tax credits to incentivize more manufacturing in coal country and funding to help these communities during the transition to clean energy. Morgan King, a staff member of West Virginia Rivers, has been traveling across the state recently to talk to local officials about how they can apply for federal IRA funding. The response has been overwhelmingly positive, King told CNN. Weve spoken with people of all parties, she said. People dont care [about] the politics of how this bill was created so long as this funding can make it into their communities. West Virginia is set to disproportionately benefit from this bill more than any other state. Manchin has been at odds with the Biden administration on several fronts, but the administrations climate policies and implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act seem to have struck a particular nerve  and Republicans have continued to heavily criticize the law. A political ad from Republican dark money group One Nation is already circulating in the state, claiming that the IRA would kill 100,000 jobs in West Virginia. The notion that this is just a climate bill ... it is damaging here in the state because were pretty far to the right on these issues, especially energy issues, Workman said. When you sell something as a climate bill, given the economic context here and our history, its somewhat harder for people to see indirect benefits like jobs. Manchin recently voted alongside Republicans on Congressional Review Act bills to undo EPA emissions rules for heavy-duty trucks as well as a climate-focused Labor Department rule (Biden has already vetoed one and promised to veto the other). In March, Manchin tanked top Interior Department nominee Laura Daniel-Davis, claiming she wasnt upholding a part of the IRA that mandates offshore oil drilling in certain federal waters. The dynamic has put Senate Democrats in a tough spot. Democrats have a slightly expanded Senate majority after the midterms, but the continued absence of California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who has been away from Washington as she recovers from shingles, has made for nailbiter votes. Hes one of the most independent US senators out there, Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii told CNN. When he is frustrated, hes not going to be shy about it. And right now, hes obviously extremely frustrated with the administration, and that has to get sorted. Manchin has also spent the last few months lobbing a steady stream of blistering statements aimed at Bidens agencies. When the Environmental Protection Agency proposed strong new vehicle emissions regulations intended to push the US auto market towards electric vehicles in the next decade, Manchin said the agency was lying to Americans and called the regulations radical and dangerous. And when the Treasury Department issued guidance on IRAs new EV tax credits  which were written by Manchin  the senator called it horrific and said it completely ignores the intent of his law. Some of his Democratic colleagues have panned his comments about repealing the IRA. Maybe he should run for president, Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico told CNN. Hes got one job; the presidents got another. The IRA is working.",29/04/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/29/politics/manchin-reelection-biden-climate-agenda/index.html
"The search for 100,000 new species in Earth? oceans","In some ways, Earths oceans are as alien to us as distant moons in the solar system. The vast bodies of water cover more than 70% of our planet and include mysterious regions like the twilight zone, where an extraordinary number of species thrive beyond the reach of sunlight  and few researchers have ventured. When scientists dived to the twilight zone and the mesophotic zone directly above it in recent years, they found colorful fish and sprawling pristine coral reefs. Now, technological innovations are helping scientists unlock this little explored deep-sea ecosystem in a fast-changing world. Researchers are hoping to shine a light on hidden marine life with an ambitious project called Ocean Census. The global initiative seeks to find 100,000 unknown species over the next 10 years. While scientists believe 2.2 million marine species exist in Earths oceans, they estimate that theyve only found 240,000, according to Ocean Census. Identifying new species also enables conservationists to find ways to protect them as Earth changes due to the climate crisis. Scientists warn that the climate crisis could reduce twilight zone species by between 20% and 40% before the end of the century  and if greenhouse gas emissions arent curbed, recovery could take thousands of years. See some of the other species at risk of disappearing due to the climate crisis. Photography and documentaries take us into the visually stunning world of the animal kingdom, but sounds like birds chirping are just as key to our understanding of how various creatures live. The first published recording of an animal was released in 1910 by the Gramophone Company Ltd., allowing people to listen to a nightingales song at home. The recording is one of more than 250,000 artifacts within the wildlife collection at Londons British Library, which has a new exhibition called Animals: Art, Science and Sound. The exhibit includes the call of the last male Kauai oo, a songbird from Hawaii, as he sings for his lost mate. The Japanese Hakuto-R lunar lander likely crashed into the moon during an attempt to make history Tuesday. A successful ending to its three-month trek would have marked the worlds first lunar landing of a commercially developed spacecraft. But the mission control team lost contact with the robotic vehicle just before it was supposed to touch down on the moon. The lander was also carrying the Rashid rover, the first Arab-built lunar spacecraft, which was designed to explore the Atlas Crater. Separately, mission designer Zhang Rongqiao revealed why Chinas Zhurong rover on Mars fell silent. The rover has been hibernating for nearly a year after an unpredictable accumulation of dust halted the mission. Black holes gobble up anything in space that dares to come too close, but some are messier than others. Scientists used 3D computer models to simulate the eating habits of these voracious space objects. Surprisingly, an elusive type of black hole dragged a star into its orbit and took a big bite out of the star each time it passed. Then, the black hole tossed the remnants of the star across the galaxy like a discarded apple core. A separate team of astronomers also captured a groundbreaking new image of a black hole releasing a jet of material into space. Meanwhile, scientists think they may have determined what triggers quasars, the brightest and most powerful objects in the universe. The Greek island of Santorini is known for its picturesque whitewashed buildings with blue adornments and glimmering sunsets over the Aegean Sea. But the popular tourist destination also sits on a live volcano thats part of a volcanic chain. Just 5 miles northeast of Santorini lies one of the East Mediterraneans most active underwater volcanoes. Called Kolumbo, it last erupted in 1650, and geologists warn that its only a matter of time before another eruption occurs. Scientists have monitored and studied Kolumbo for years to determine how soon or distant that eruption may be. Extreme conditions in the volcanos crater are helping NASA prepare to investigate alien oceans on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn. Linger a little longer over these intriguing stories:  Elephants have lost a significant part of their habitat across Asia due to humans, which could lead to challenging encounters between the two populations.  Before NASAs InSight mission ended in December, the lander tracked seismic waves as they traveled through the center of Mars, revealing secrets about the red planets interior.

First Red Cross aid arrives in Sudan after weeks of fighting,"Red Cross aid landed in Sudan for the first time since fighting broke out between rival military forces three weeks ago, some rare good news in a conflict that shows little sign of ending. Eight tonnes of medical aid arrived on Sunday, the International Committee of the Red Cross said in a statement, offering relief to Sudans hard-hit medical facilities. Thousands of foreign nationals have been evacuated from Sudan and thousands of local families have fled the capital Khartoum amid the clashes between the Sudan Armed Forces and the rival Rapid Support Forces . Fresh gunfire was heard on Sunday near the closely contested presidential palace in the capital Khartoum, witnesses told CNN. A ceasefire agreed Friday has always been shaky and is due to expire on Sunday evening. The RSF says it will extend the truce for another 72 hours but there has been no immediate word from the army. This weekend, the Sudanese police were deployed in Khartoum for the first time since the outbreak of the clashes to maintain security amid heavy looting. Among those deployed were combat-trained police personnel from the Central Reserve Forces. Residents on the ground have told CNN that markets and shops have been heavily targeted by looters in the past few days. Hatem Awadallah, a German citizen of Sudanese origin who lives in Khartoum told CNN in a phone call that he had been the victim of looting by members of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). I woke up at 1:30 a.m. to the sound of a Kalashnikov weapon that was placed on my head and a group of armed RSF men... demanding that I give them any amount of money  or I would be killed, Awadallah said. He added that his 83-year-old mother and family had also been threatened with guns by thieves who demanded money. The family ended up surrendering $14,000 while thieves also stole another $5,000 and destroyed two iPhones and an iPad by shooting them. They looted a new car  a Toyota truck  and then left the house, Awadallah said. Three of our house guards who were tied up, told us that those who looted them came in four armed cars belonging to the RSF, he said. The fighting came as several countries reported the evacuation of thousands of foreign nationals. The UK says it has evacuated more than 2,000 people so far, the vast majority British nationals and their dependents. The government said it would run another evacuation flight to help British nationals to leave Port Sudan on Monday, although it was not immediately clear where the flight would go to. China, meanwhile, said it had evacuated 940 Chinese citizens and 231 foreign personnel from Sudan to Saudi Arabia between Wednesday and Saturday. In order to protect the lives and property of Chinese citizens in Sudan, the Chinese military has been ordered to evacuate Chinese personnel in Sudan, said Senior Colonel Tan Kefei. General Turki Al-Maliki, spokesperson for the Saudi Ministry of Defense, told CNN Sunday that 5,197 people from 100 nations had so far been evacuated with Saudi ships from Port Sudan. The first US-led effort to evacuate private American citizens was completed on Saturday, with a convoy organized by the US government reaching Port Sudan after a long journey from the capital Khartoum. The effort came amid mounting anger from Americans in Sudan who felt abandoned by the US government, which had maintained for more than a week that conditions were not conducive to a civilian evacuation despite all US government personnel being evacuated in a military operation last weekend. But while many foreign nationals have now been evacuated, on the ground many Sudanese remain stuck in deteriorating and deadly conditions. Hundreds have been killed and thousands wounded since the fighting broke out. Experts say the country is now at risk of a humanitarian disaster, as those still trapped in their homes face shortages of food, water, medicine and electricity. Thousands of families that have fled Khartoum have headed to the city of Shendi, where citizens have launched an initiative to open their homes to help them. CNN journalists in Sudan have been told that more than 10,000 families have made the journey to Shendi, 172 km north of Khartoum, in the past two weeks. Those that do not have family in Shendi are being offered housing for free by homeowners in Shendi and nearby villages such as Al-Musayyab, Al-Musayyab, Al-Shaghalwa. The organizers of the initiative told CNN that they greeted arrivals with food and drinks and have offered medical assistance. Those at risk of kidney failure are being housed closer to hospitals. All medical care and housing is being offered free of charge.",30/04/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/30/world/sudan-crisis-china-uk-uae-evacuations-fighting-unrest-looting-intl-hnk/index.html
"Supreme Court to hear major case on limiting the power of federal government, a long-term goal of legal conservatives","The Supreme Court agreed Monday to reconsider long held precedent and decide whether to significantly scale back on the power of federal agencies in a case that can impact everything from how the government addresses everything from climate change to public health to immigration. Conservative justices have long sought to rein in regulatory authority, arguing that Washington has too much control over American businesses and individual lives. The justices have been incrementally diminishing federal power but the new case would allow them to take a much broader stride. The justices announced they would take up an appeal from herring fishermen in the Atlantic who say the National Marine Fisheries Service does not have the authority to require them to pay the salaries of government monitors who ride aboard the fishing vessels. Their action means they will reconsider a 1984 case  Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council  that sets forward factors to determine when courts should defer to a government agencys interpretation of the law. Conservatives on the bench have cast a skeptical eye on the so-called Chevron deference, arguing that agencies are often too insulated from the usual checks and balances essential to the separation of powers. The idea that agencies should be allowed to resolve ambiguities in statutes that they enforce has been a central feature of modern administrative law, said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. If its up to courts rather than agencies to resolve ambiguities even in statutes delegating highly technical authority to the executive branch, that will give courts more power  and the executive branch less  on everything from environmental regulation to immigration to public health to meat inspections to telecommunications policy, Vladeck said. In that respect, its consistent with the current conservative majoritys pattern of weakening the administrative state  in favor of judicial power to answer all of these questions. The case will be heard next term, with a ruling likely in 2024. A separate case already on the justices calendar for next session, which begins in October, relatedly offers the opportunity to rein in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which currently oversees practices related to mortgages, car loans and credit cards. In the case at hand, the herring fishermen, represented by former Solicitor General Paul Clement, argue that their boats normally only have room for five or six individuals. Now, they are not only required to carry the monitors (who are checking to see if federal regulations concerning fishery conservation are being followed) but the National Marine Fisheries Service says they must pay the observers salaries as well. Clement argued that the agency exceeded its authority and needed direct and clear congressional authorization to make the demand. In a country that values limited government and the separation of powers, such an extraordinary power should require the clearest of congressional grants, he said. A federal appeals court deferred to the agency. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar told the justices that the agency was acting within the scope of its authority under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act and said the fishermen are not responsible for all the costs. The regulation was put in place to combat overfishing of the fisheries off the coasts of the US.

Washington Gov. Jay Inslee won? seek reelection,"Washington Gov. Jay Inslee announced on Monday that he will not seek a fourth term in 2024, saying in a statement that Im ready to pass the torch. Inslee, who ran in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, didnt give any indication of his plans once he leaves office, saying only that now is the time to intensely focus on all we can accomplish in the next year and a half, and I intend to do just that. In a statement announcing his decision, Inslee highlighted his record on issues such as climate change, childcare, criminal justice reform and gun violence. Climate change was also a point of emphasis for Inslee during his short-lived 2020 presidential campaign. The second governor to serve three consecutive terms in Washington history, Inslee was first elected in 2012, winning a narrow race against Rob McKenna, then the states attorney general. Inslee increased his share of the vote in both consecutive reelection campaigns, winning by more than 10 points in 2020. Inslee made climate change central to his agenda. He signed several legislative packages seeking to address the issue, including efforts to establish emission caps. Inslee also enacted a paid leave program of up to 16 weeks, among the most generous in the nation at the time, and he steered his state through the Covid-19 pandemic. Inslees decision creates an open gubernatorial race in a state that has been reliably Democratic in recent cycles  though Republicans have worked to make gains in the state, with the 2022 matchup between Democratic incumbent Sen. Patty Murray and GOP challenger Tiffany Smiley registering as the most expensive congressional race in state history. Murray went on to defeat Smiley by 15 points. Potential successors on the Democratic side include Bob Ferguson, the states Democratic attorney general, who said he is seriously considering a bid, and Public Lands Commissioner Hilary Franz, who said a lot of people are asking me to run. Meanwhile, former GOP Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler has also indicated interest in a run. The longtime 3rd District representative lost a competitive primary in 2022 to a Trump-backed challenger, Joe Kent, after her vote to impeach Donald Trump provoked the former presidents ire.",01/05/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/01/politics/washington-gov-jay-inslee-reelection/index.html
It? time to worry about a US default. For real this time,"Two converging crises are testing American confidence in their financial well-being. Theres a banking crisis, which regulatory officials and big American banks very much want you to believe is ending after decisive action over the weekend to take over and swallow up another failing bank. And theres a debt crisis, which is becoming more urgent as the US approaches the X-date  when it would default  and on which opposing lawmakers arent currently talking to each other. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Monday the X-date could arrive as soon as June 1. But it has been a moving target. President Joe Biden on Monday called the top four congressional leaders, including House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, to discuss raising the debt ceiling, according to two sources familiar with the matter. Americans woke up Monday to news that a third US bank, First Republic, had failed. Having catered to wealthy coastal clients, First Republic had been on the edge of collapse since March, when two other regional banks failed. First Republic Bank was taken over by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on Monday, and most of its assets were sold to JPMorgan Chase. The culmination of government regulators and the banking industry came together to protect creditors and maintain confidence in the banking system as a whole without exposing taxpayers to an unpopular bailout. Nobody is crying over First Republic Bank, said Christine Romans, CNNs chief business correspondent, during an appearance on CNN This Morning. But you dont want chaos and turmoil to spread to the rest of the banking system, she added, explaining the takeover. The former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, speaking to Bloomberg before the takeover, said its important to tamp down troubles in the banking system because they can easily spread. These things are like forest fires, said Summers. It is much easier to prevent them than it is to contain them after they start to spread. Praising the intervention, Biden tried to reassure Americans that the banking system was safe and sound during an appearance in Washington, DC, on Monday. None of that means this is a golden chapter for the American financial system. The failure of three banks this year suggests a hard look at how banks are overseen. And the Federal Reserve has lost some credibility among top economists. It remains to be seen whether the still-simmering financial turmoil triggered by SVBs (Silicon Valley Bank) collapse will boil over into a deeper crisis, but investors and depositors have no reason to trust the Feds assurances that it will not, Joseph Stiglitz, a Columbia University professor and Nobel laureate, wrote for MarketWatch. Only meaningful reforms of deposit insurance, governance, regulatory structure and supervision can restore confidence in banks and the Feds credibility. In fact, the FDIC is advocating to raise the amount of deposits insured above the current $250,000 cap. Read more on that developing story. If only American lawmakers could take a cue from the First Republic saga and get into a room to solve the debt crisis. Instead, Republican and Democratic lawmakers are still posturing even though the country is a month or so away from the X-date, when it begins defaulting on its debts. What exactly would happen immediately after the X-date is not entirely clear, but it could lead to a crisis of confidence in the US government, making it more difficult to continue to finance Social Security and Medicare; threaten the value of the dollar, which has been a cornerstone of the world economy; and tip the country into a recession. Read more predictions here. Rather than clearing their calendars to make sure the government can continue to write checks for all the debt it has already accrued, lawmakers are still in their partisan corners. Last week, House Republicans made their opening bid in the negotiations by passing a bill to indiscriminately lop off billions in federal spending, revert to 2022 spending levels, undo anti-climate change spending championed by Democrats and impose new work requirements for Medicaid recipients. The bill, which is a nonstarter in the Senate, would also guarantee another debt debate this time next year. This week, rather than hash things out, McCarthy is in Jerusalem, meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The president still hasnt talked to me, McCarthy said, making clear he wants to negotiate with Biden. The White House, meanwhile, has argued there should be no negotiation over paying bills for debt sold to cover spending already authorized by Congress. America is not a deadbeat nation, Biden said during that event in Washington, using the term associated with parents who fail to pay child support. We have never ever failed to meet the debt. And as a result, one of the most respected nations of the world, we pay our bills and we should do so without reckless hostage taking from some of the MAGA Republicans in Congress. I asked Justin Wolfers, a professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan, what separates the debt crisis from the banking crisis. He told me over the phone hes not at all worried about the money he has deposited in an American bank, arguing he has complete confidence in the FDIC to cover deposits, as it and banks have done for all three banks that failed this year. He also pointed out the bank failures represent three relatively small institutions by US standards. But he is extremely worried about the US defaulting on its debt. This generation of bank regulators learned from the mistakes of the Great Depression and the 2008 financial crisis, Wolfers said, suggesting they have no qualms about stepping in early to maintain confidence in the financial system. There is no similar confidence in the nations politicians to do the same. Theres a great fear that this generation of legislators are more irresponsible, more polarized and more willing to do damage than any previous generation, he said. We will, at some point in the very near future, get to the place where Biden and McCarthy, along with other top Democrats and Republicans, must come together to avoid a default or deal with the aftermath of its occurrence. The question is whether the economy is damaged in the meantime. I will tell you that I am more worried than Ive ever been in my career, at this moment, about the sky actually falling, Wolfers said, noting that in previous standoffs over the debt ceiling, Republicans have ultimately stood down in the face of pressure from more moderate wings of the party. Its not clear that will happen this time.",01/05/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/01/politics/bank-debt-crisis-default-what-matters/index.html
"Disappearing lakes, dead crops and trucked-in water: Drought-stricken Spain is running dry","Standing in his field of stunted, withered maize, Santi Caudevilla is very worried. If the weather does not change it will be zero. Nothing is going to be harvested, he said. Caudevilla, who grows maize, sorghum and other crops in Gimenells in Catalonia, has been hit hard by the severe drought which has hammered this part of northeastern Spain. Rainfall has been low for years. We are in a desert. This is a desert today, he said. The lack of water is starting to feel like an existential crisis for farmers such as Caudevilla and he is worried about the future of his profession. Its becoming increasingly hard to make ends meet as crops shrivel through lack of water  or cannot be planted at all. Droughts are a fact of life in this corner of Spain. They are typical of Catalonias Mediterranean climate, said Albert Ruhi, a freshwater ecologist at the University of California, Berkeley, who is originally from Catalonia. But a significant lack of rain and snow have made this one much, much drier, he told CNN. This is the worst period that we have had for the last 100 years, Samuel Reyes, director of the Catalan Water Agency, told CNN. The problem spreads beyond Catalonia. Spain has been in a long-term drought since the end of 2022, said Ricardo Torrijo, a spokesperson for AEMET, the Spanish national weather service. In March, the country only received 36% of the average monthly rainfall, making it the second driest March this century. The trend continued into April, which could end up being the driest on record, Torrijo told CNN. Drought conditions have been exacerbated by searing temperatures that are more reminiscent of mid-July than spring. Last Thursday, April records were smashed, with the city of Cordoba in southern Spain reaching 38.8 degrees Celsius (101.8 degrees Fahrenheit). The combination of drought and heat have stoked fears for a repeat of last summer where the country saw blistering heat waves and wildfires that burned through 306,000 hectares (756,000 acres). Unusually early wildfires this spring have already burned more than 10,000 acres in the eastern region of Castellon. These conditions point to a new reality for parts of Europe, which is warming twice as fast as the global average. While it will take time to pin down the exact role climate change is playing, scientists are clear that human-caused global heating is making droughts and heat waves more common and more extreme. The cracked, desiccated earth at the Sau Reservoir reveals the heavy toll the lack of rainfall has taken on Catalonias water sources. Located about 60 miles north of Barcelona, the reservoir is a key drinking water source for the region, but in late April it was only at 7% of capacity. Its water levels are so low that a medieval village, flooded when the lake was created in the 1960s, has emerged, lending an eerie presence to the sun-baked lakebed. Authorities have been forced to siphon out water from the reservoir in an attempt to protect water quality and have had to remove native fish to stop them asphyxiating. Reservoir levels across Catalonia are hovering at around 25%, substantially lower than usual for this time of year. The lack of water is having a catastrophic impact on farms across the region. There is no precedent, said Marti Costal, head of water at the Young Farmers and Ranchers of Catalonia (JARC). The majority of wheat and barley harvests on rainfed land will be lost, and on irrigated land will be cut by half, Costal told CNN. If it does not rain in May it will be a disaster, he said. Its a story which tracks across the countrys agricultural heartlands. Drought affects 60% of Spains countryside, and has destroyed crops across 3.5 million hectares (8.6 million acres), according to the Coordinator of Farmers and Ranchers Organizations (COAG). Thats an area bigger than the state of Maryland. Livestock farming is at risk as farmers need pasture to feed their animals. Without it, they are forced to buy food. Losses are also expected for orchards, vineyards, olive oil production and vegetable farming, Serge Zaka, an agrometeorologist, told CNN. These agro-climatic conditions are leading to an agricultural disaster, he said. A lack of vegetation is also preventing bees from making honey. Beekeepers are facing a third consecutive season without a harvest thanks to water shortages, according to COAG. In April, Spain requested emergency funding from the European Union to help farmers cope with the impacts of the drought. Water scarcity is not just affecting farmers, but also drinking water. The village of Castellcir, around 30 miles north of Barcelona, is one of many in Catalonia that have been relying on water brought in on trucks. People have been asked to save water by having quick showers, being careful when washing dishes and not filling their pools. The situation has been going on for more than a year, said Juan Cogdony, a resident of the village. We are very worried, he told CNN. It just wont rain, Cogdony said, looking up at the sky. There is no water. Beer, yes, but no water, he joked. As the summer approaches, and the hope of heavy spring rains fade, many are sounding the alarm on what might be in store for Spain. We are now in a very dramatic situation, said Joan Girona Gomis, a scientist at the Institute of Agrifood Research and Technology, a research organization owned by the Catalonian government. Without significant rain we will suffer a bad drought this summer, he told CNN. Gomis has been working on experiments to increase the efficiency of irrigation systems used by farmers, including by using technology such as sensors to evaluate the precise amount of water crops need. Whether Catalonia can remain one of Europes key farming regions is the big question, Gomis said. It all depends on if we are able to adapt. It will mean big changes, Costal said, including researching drought-resistant crops, investment in urban and agricultural infrastructure and improvements in water efficiency. He hopes whats happening in Spain and other parts of Europe will remind people where their food comes from. The fruits are produced in the field, not on the shelves of a supermarket, he said. In Gimenells, Caudevilla is deeply worried about what will happen to the Catalonian countryside if, as expected, droughts and heat waves become more frequent and more intense. This area is facing abandonment, he said. Farmers are aging, he added, in 10 years nobody will want to work in this countryside.",02/05/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/02/europe/spain-drought-catalonia-heat-wave-climate-intl/index.html
"Hundreds of hazardous sites in California are at risk of flooding as sea level rises, study finds","Hundreds of hazardous industrial sites that dot the California coastline  including oil and gas refineries and sewage-treatment plants  are at risk of severe flooding from rising sea level if the climate crisis worsens, new research shows. If planet-warming pollution continues to rise unabated, 129 industrial sites are estimated to be at risk of coastal flooding by 2050 according to the study, published Tuesday in the journal Environmental Science & Technology by researchers from University of California at Los Angeles and Berkeley, as well as Climate Central. Researchers also found that residents living within a kilometer  about 0.6 miles  of these contaminated sites tend to be more vulnerable: people of color, the elderly, unemployed and low-income communities. By the end of the century, the number of at-risk toxic sites could increase to 423, and the disadvantaged population around those sites is expected to grow as well. Its the first study that takes a comprehensive look at a broad suite of hazardous sites impacted from rapidly rising seas, said lead author Lara Cushing, assistant professor of Environmental Health Sciences at UCLA. Whats notable is that there are certain types of facilities where a very large proportion of them are at risk, like oil refineries, which have been a focal point of environmental justice organizing and community concern about toxic exposures, Cushing told CNN. Explore the map: Hazardous facilities on the coast at risk to flooding Amee Raval, a co-author of the study and the policy and research director of the Asian Pacific Environmental Network, said the findings are concerning because dangerous amounts of substances and contaminants typically flow out of these facilities when inundated by floods, polluting the land and air and often seeping into communities groundwater, underscoring previous flooding incidents that pummeled oil and gas facilities along the Gulf Coast. While climate change affects everyone, the experience really feels dramatically different depending on who you are and where you live, Raval told CNN. What this report really reinforces is that the oil refineries that bring sickness and death into our homes are also fueling the flames of climate change. Many of the hazardous sites this study highlights are clustered around large metro areas on the coast: San Diego and Los Angeles in Southern California; in the San Francisco Bay Area in Central California; and around Eureka in Northern California. To improve their scientific findings, which are based on various government and academic databases including the Environmental Protection Agencys Facility Registry Service, Cushing and the studys researchers reached out to community members. The groups involved, including the Asian Pacific Environmental Network, led a series of webinars to share preliminary results and get feedback from a larger set of stakeholders, Cushing said. This type of approach, I feel, really improves the science and helps ensure that were asking policy-relevant questions of concern to potentially impacted communities. One of the things that came out of the meetings were concerns regarding groundwater. At first, researchers only looked at how rising sea levels affected surface water, but after hearing the communitys concerns, they set out to measure how much groundwater levels would rise in the future, and how it would move toxins further inland. Kristina Dahl, a California-based climate scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists who is not involved with the study, said it is notable that the study incorporated future changes in groundwater levels, given recent concerns over the Wests megadrought and over-pumping. Most studies of the future impacts of sea level rise look only at what happens above ground because data on groundwater can be limited and challenging to model, Dahl told CNN. By incorporating groundwater data, this study identifies hundreds of additional at-risk sties that will have heightened flood risk as sea level rises. Raval said its not a coincidence that toxic sites such as sewage treatment plants and oil and gas facilities are located in historically marginalized communities. We know that the boundaries around race and class closely aligns with hotspots of pollution, she said. These are communities that have been historically disinvested from and therefore have been dumping grounds for the extractive economy, because our communities didnt have that political power to fight and resist that kind of placement of these facilities, but our organizing now is resisting that narrative. Dahl said the magnitude of sea level rise risk in the long term in places like California will depend on the choices people make today. Sea level will continue to rise even as we cut emissions, but we can see from this study that putting ourselves on a lower-emissions pathway could head off flood risk for dozens and dozens of toxic sites and the communities that surround them, she said.",02/05/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/02/us/sea-level-rise-impact-california-climate/index.html
These adorable sand cats could be under threat,"It was only seven years ago that sand kittens were photographed in the wild for the first time. Unsurprisingly, images of the tiny, furry cats went viral on the internet. Few people had seen these desert-dwelling fluffballs before and scientists knew very little about the species. But thanks to new research, this is beginning to change. In March, a four-year-long study on sand cats was published in the Journal of Arid Environments. It provides the largest dataset on the home range of sand cats ever recorded and reveals how these elusive wild cats survive in harsh, dry environments across North Africa, the Middle East and southwest and central Asia. In looks, sand cats are similar to their domestic relatives but they are slightly smaller and have larger ears to hear their prey. Although equally adorable, these cats are not for petting. They are lethal killers, with the report finding evidence of them preying on rodents and reptiles, including venomous snakes. They eat several (prey) per night to get their energy intake and they dont drink at all, says Dr. Gregory Breton, managing director of Panthera France, the global wild cat conservation organization, and co-author of the study. They rely on the blood from their prey to get fluid and water. The cats are also extraordinarily stealthy. Their sandy color camouflages them in the desert environment, they bury their feces and they dont leave remains of their prey, while sand quickly sweeps away their paw prints. This elusive nature is no doubt one of the reasons sand cats have been so under-reported, says Breton. Although the species was first scientifically recorded in 1858  after being spotted in the northern Sahara by a French soldier  there have only been a handful of research articles published on it since, many with scant data. Yet the mystery around the sand cat is what sparked Bretons curiosity, leading him to start researching the species in 2013. They are very fascinating because nothing has really been done on them, he says, adding that deeper understanding of the species could help to inform conservation efforts. The study, which was carried out in partnership between Panthera, Cologne Zoo and Rabat Zoo, focused on an area of scorching desert in southern Morocco, where temperatures can reach up to 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit). A team of five, including scientists and a veterinarian, captured and fitted 22 sand cats with VHF radio collars and intermittently followed and observed them between 2015 and 2019. The results were astonishing, says Breton. We are rejecting many of the assumptions that were made before. The first of these is a new estimate for the sand cats home range. Previous studies suggested that sand cats move across an area of up to 50 square kilometers (19 square miles), but Bretons team showed their range to be far bigger  with one sand cat covering an area of up to 1,758 square kilometers (679 square miles) in just over six months. The report notes that sand cats appear to travel greater distances than any other cat of their size, including black-footed cats and African wildcats. In fact, their ranges even rival that of much larger cats such as lions, tigers and leopards, says Breton. The study also suggests that sand cats may lead a nomadic lifestyle, shifting from one home to another depending on rainfall or environmental conditions. While more research needs to be done to confirm this theory, Breton believes it would be a real breakthrough because no other wild cat species is known to be nomadic. The desert environment is the driving force behind their habits and behavior, he adds. The reports findings could have serious implications for the sand cats conservation status. The species is currently listed as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), but the new information on home range sizes could mean that the population is smaller than previous estimates, and the authors are urging the IUCN to reconsider the sand cats listing. Breton thinks the sand cats may be more endangered than was previously thought, given their home range, the limited resources and the fragile ecosystem. He notes that their desert habitat is extremely fragile and vulnerable to climate change. There are also local threats from shepherd dogs that sometimes kill sand cats; domestic cats carrying diseases that are dangerous for the wild species; and there have also been cases of sand cats being captured for the illegal pet trade, he adds. Urs Breitenmoser, co-chair of the IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group, welcomes the new research on the understudied cat species. He believes it will be useful in the ongoing reassessment of the sand cats listing. But he cautions that the study is from one area on the far western edge of the sand cats wide range. The question will be how representative the new information is for the entire species and distribution range, he says. Breton believes that further research will be key to protecting the sand cats and he encourages other scientists to carry out similar studies across the species range. We need to better understand their behavior, how they move and use the landscape, and to clearly identify the threats, he says.",02/05/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/02/world/sand-cat-research-c2e-spc-intl-scn/index.html
Why First Republic may not be the end of the crisis,"After a six-week spiral, First Republic bank finally collapsed in the wee hours of Monday morning. Federal regulators seized the bank and immediately sold most of its assets to JPMorgan Chase, making fast work of what is now the second-largest bank failure in US history after Washington Mutual in 2008 (which was then acquired by  you guessed it  JPMorgan Chase). For those keeping track at home: Thats three US bank failures in less than two months. Whats going on? A quick refresher on how we got here: The markets seemed, if not pleased, at least not totally freaked out by the First Republic resolution. Stocks ended the day down, but only slightly. The First Republic news was just one of many closely watched events that will weigh on investors this week. (Get excited: weve got JOLTS, the Fed policy meeting and the April jobs report to look forward to.) Everyone on Wall Street appears to be drinking from the same punch bowl as Jamie Dimon, who framed the sale as a bookend to the crisis. No crystal ball is perfect, but yes, I think the banking system is very stable, Dimon said on an investor call Monday. This part of the crisis is over. Not everyone shares that optimism, of course. I spoke to Robert Hockett, a law professor and expert on public finance at Cornell University, for the decidedly less sunny take: Contrary to cheery Wall Street and Washington predictions made over the weekend, this is not the end of the March banking crisis  it is still the beginning, Hockett said. To his mind, the sale just makes JPMorgan, already the nations largest bank, even bigger, and the power of the biggest Wall Street banks more concentrated. The effect of that is the hollowing out of the regional banking industry. Hockett and others argue that its time to scrap, or at least lift, the $250,000 limit on deposit insurance, and thereby stop the panic that causes depositors to flee. That idea got an extra boost on Monday, when the FDIC itself released a report advocating for an increase in the deposit insurance limit for business payment accounts. Lawmakers in DC have reportedly been in talks to, at least temporarily, expand the upper limit of the FDIC cap. While $250K is a lot for a regular person, the accounts that have bankers on edge are those belonging to businesses, which have, like, payroll and other operating expenses that easily top that amount. Theres no need for there to be those caps, Hockett said. My fear is if we dont do this really fast, what were going to see is the Jamie Dimon banks gobbling up the remainder of the regional banking industry, and that is ultimately going to bring about some kind of nationalization of the banking system. He added: Theres no way that well be able to finance production and startups and small businesses in every region of the country if the only banks we have are a few gigantic banks located either in Wall Street or San Francisco. Eliminating caps would require banks to pay more into the deposit insurance fund, though he envisions a tiered system in which large banks that take on more risk pay a higher premium. You can think of federal deposit insurance as being a bit like nuclear weapons, he said. You only have them so that you dont have to use them. Enjoying Nightcap?

Millions of Americans could suffer if debt showdown isn? solved in next 30 days,"The jobs, benefits and financial security of millions of Americans could start disappearing in less than a month as the Republican House leverages a debt showdown to try to force big spending cuts on President Joe Biden. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Monday issued a stark warning that the US government could run out of money to pay its obligations as soon as June 1 unless Congress raises its borrowing authority. Failure to do so could trigger a domestic and international financial catastrophe. Yellen wrote to House Speaker Kevin McCarthy that unless Congress acted, it would cause severe hardship to American families, harm our global leadership position, and raise questions about our ability to defend our national security interests. Experts have warned of a potential crisis on the scale of the 2008 financial meltdown, with the threat of benefits not being paid to veterans and senior citizens, and halts to military funding and vital government programs. Her letter swiftly turned what has for weeks been a theoretical threat of a default sometime this summer into a real-time nightmare with a flashing deadline, leaving little time for McCarthy and Biden to find a way to save the economy. McCarthy has accepted an invitation to meet with the president on May 9 about the debt ceiling, according to a source familiar, setting the stage for the high-stakes moment. Biden on Monday invited congressional leaders to the White House next week for talks on the crisis. The political futures of both the Democratic president and Republican speaker may depend on winning the showdown, and it is unclear whether there is room for a compromise that could satisfy each of them. Yellens letter may also go some way to sparking alarm on Wall Street about the situation after a period in which investors appeared sanguine that the perennially dysfunctional Congress would likely step back from the precipice at the last minute. The gulf between the parties remains massive. Republicans want Biden to make huge concessions on spending that would fundamentally reshape his legacy. They are using the debt ceiling crisis and the possibility of a financial catastrophe to try to get the spending cuts they hope could define their time in the majority. There is nothing wrong with Republicans using power won in a democratic election to fight for what they say they and their voters want  reductions to what they see as bloated federal spending and efforts to slow the growth of the national debt, which currently stands at more than $31 trillion. But the question they face is whether it is appropriate to use the prospect of fiscal Armageddon to advance a partisan goal. The president is refusing to cave into their demands. He insists Congress must pass a clean bill to raise the governments borrowing limit  a power only Congress has. He says he is willing to discuss spending  but only in the context of the yearly budget  a process the House GOP has barely started. The coming debt crisis represents the most acute moment yet in a period of divided government that will show whether Washington is able to overcome the countrys political estrangement. The most sobering reality is that if the US tumbles off the debt cliff, it will be a self-inflicted disaster that would shatter Americas reputation as a haven of financial stability that is critical in cementing Washingtons global leadership. The debt ceiling needs to be raised because the government takes in less money in revenue than it spends. It is able to borrow money at excellent rates because it has a reputation of always paying its bills. Democrats point out that government borrowing authority needs to be raised since Congress is obligated to pay for spending that it has already approved. They also cite the fact that Republicans had no trouble doing so when former President Donald Trump was in office. With the moment of disaster approaching, the most worrying thing is that each side seems to believe that the prospect of the unthinkable will eventually force the other to blink to avoid being saddled with the blame. But theres no evidence yet either can or will. This is not the way to do things, to hold the entire economy hostage to your political agenda, Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut told CNNs Wolf Blitzer on Monday. Its juvenile. Its irresponsible. Its essentially political arson. But South Carolina Republican Rep. Nancy Mace told CNNs Jake Tapper on The Lead that the president and the Senate ought to come to the table and work together with Republicans and make some decisions about how we move forward and take on spending and the debt. McCarthy heads a radical and tiny House majority that is cast in the disruptive image of Trump. A Republican wish-list bill, which raised the debt ceiling for a year in return for measures like expanding work requirements for Medicaid and cuts to climate change spending, squeezed through the House last week by the narrowest margin possible. Even if Biden were willing to negotiate, theres no guarantee McCarthy could pass any compromise that did not involve the presidents utter capitulation. And if the California Republican tried to pass a less confrontational bill to shield the economy with the support of some Democrats, he could be ousted by his conference. Biden faces equally existential questions. Given that he is dealing with a Republican House that seems bent on an extreme path, he is likely to face calls in the coming days to show that he is the adult in the room and to make concessions in order to shield millions of Americans from harm. But in doing so, hed show weakness that would compromise his presidency and encourage Republicans to wield the nightmare scenario of a debt default again down the road. He may also demoralize Democratic voters he needs to support the reelection bid he launched last week. The administrations logic is that if hostage takers get concessions, they will demand more. Much will depend on whether Democrats in Congress stand firm behind the president amid growing concern about the political impact of the crisis. It also remains to be seen whether more moderate Republicans critical to the party defending its majority in 2024 begin to demand their own concessions and for McCarthy to stand up to hardliners. And ultimately, given that only Congress  and not the president  has the power to raise the debt ceiling, the fate of the country may rest on whether McCarthy is willing to risk his career and speakership to avert the worst consequences of this game of Russian roulette with the economy. Given that it took him 15 rounds of voting to win the speakership in January, which required multiple concessions to his partys most extreme members, that seems unlikely. So is there any hope that catastrophe can be avoided? I will take a bit of positive news out of this  they are talking, at least we have got that part going. For the last several months, they werent even doing that, Jim Bianco, a financial analyst and president of Bianco Research, told CNNs Erin Burnett on Monday. But Bianco also warned that things are already not going well in an economy that did not need the shock of a debt default. The worry is that the May 9 meeting with Biden and McCarthy and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell will only entrench divides. The White House stressed on Monday that the meeting would focus on the need for a clean bill to raise the debt ceiling  signaling no shift toward McCarthys position. The speaker reinforced his stand during a trip to Israel that he used to goad the president. House Republicans did their job and passed a responsible bill that raises the debt ceiling, avoids default, and tackles reckless spending, he said in a statement on Monday. Meanwhile, President Biden has refused to do his job  threatening to bumble our nation into its first ever default  and the clock is ticking. This is the kind of pre-game positioning expected ahead of a tough negotiation and is similar to that which preceded a deal that narrowly averted a debt default in 2011 between then-House Speaker John Boehner and then-President Barack Obama. But even though fiscal disaster was averted that time, the US did lose the top-level credit rating awarded by ratings agency S&P, which raised US borrowing costs for years afterward. More than a decade on, the bitterness between the parties is deeper and the GOP has marched far to the right, making the possibility of a compromise even more questionable. Some members of the GOP House majority  in which McCarthy can only lose four votes and still pass a bill  have said they will never vote to raise the debt ceiling. In more normal circumstances, it would be possible to see a way out of the situation. In a classic Washington fudge, Biden could agree to curbs on spending in a budget negotiated with Republican leaders in the House that could then get through the Senate. Republican House members could argue that they had beaten Biden as cover for passing a clean bill raising the debt ceiling. The president could allow McCarthy that symbolic victory in return for getting new government borrowing authority that would spare the country and the world the impact of a debt default. But such an outcome would require trust between the parties, a functioning relationship between McCarthy and Biden, courageous leadership and a willingness from lawmakers in both parties to cast tough votes that could come back to haunt them in primary races. None of these qualities appear in ready supply in Washington in an age of increasing polarization. The debt ceiling will have to be raised eventually. But its growing increasingly hard to see how it could happen without some of the consequences of a default playing out to show both sides the severity of the political costs that subsequent misery could cause Americans. Senate Minority Whip John Thune told reporters that Mondays developments only underscored the need for Biden and McCarthy to get to work. Times a-wasting, the South Dakota Republican said.",02/05/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/02/politics/debt-showdown-biden-mccarthy/index.html
More green investment hasn? softened red resistance on climate,"Even as billions of dollars in new clean energy investments surge into Republican leaning communities around the country, state and federal GOP officials are hardening their resistance to efforts to reduce the nations reliance on fossil fuels. That stark contrast has dashed a central hope and expectation among environmentalists: the belief that more economic opportunity in red places would mean less political opposition from Republicans to the transition toward a clean energy economy that scientists say is necessary to reduce the risk of catastrophic global climate change. The persistence of GOP opposition to that transition underscores the limits of economic incentives to overcome ideological inclinations  and points toward years of pitched partisan conflict that could make it virtually impossible for the US to set a consistent course on climate policy. This dynamic was encapsulated last week when virtually every House Republican voted, in the partys debt ceiling plan, to repeal the clean energy incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act Democrats passed last year, even though those incentives have already triggered investments in 72 Republican-held districts, including over two dozen districts that have received massive investments of $1 billion or more in new plants or expansions of existing facilities. Its also apparent in decisions by Republican state attorneys general from states that are among the top beneficiaries of new clean energy investments and jobs to launch a flurry of lawsuits and other legal proceedings against proposals from President Joe Bidens administration to speed the transition toward a low-carbon economy. This opposition contravenes the traditional assumption that politicians almost always support the economic interests creating opportunity for their constituents. With growing boldness, Republicans and conservative activists are framing defense of fossil fuels and skepticism of clean energy alternatives as a form of culture war  with the transition to wind, solar and electric vehicles taking its place alongside transgender rights, woke indoctrination in the classroom or restrictions on gun ownership as an example of coastal elites trying to erase traditional American values. In opposing measures to promote clean energy even in places benefiting from new investments to produce it, Republicans believe  and the next election will help us see whether this is a good strategy or not  that culture war is going to be better to help them win than talking about jobs and the economy, said Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Program on Climate Change Communication at Yale University. In all these ways, climate change has become another fissure along the central fault line in modern American politics. Like attitudes toward demographic and cultural change, perspectives on shifting the nations energy mix from its historic reliance on fossil fuels toward low-carbon alternatives now pit the Democratic coalition of transformation that largely embraces the way America is changing on every front against the Republican coalition of restoration that resists it. For many Republicans, the Inflation Reduction Acts sweeping provisions to encourage carbon-free energy sources arent a bipartisan domestic energy agenda, even though those incentives are channeling substantial jobs and investment to red places, said Robert McNally, a Republican energy consultant and former White House energy adviser for President George W. Bush. This is a left wing, coastal lets change the world by having the federal government intervene at a time of high inflation kind of thing. When a Republican member does the pros and cons, its not like they dont see the pros, but they see a lot of cons. Republican-leaning states, as Ive written, are generally more integrated into the existing fossil fuel economy than blue-leaning places. Trump won 20 of the 21 states that emit the most carbon from their energy sector per each dollar of economic activity, mostly states between the coasts that are either big producers of fossil fuels (Wyoming, West Virginia, Texas) or big consumers of it to power robust agricultural and manufacturing sectors (Iowa, Nebraska, Ohio, Indiana). Biden in turn won 19 of the 21 states with the least emissions, most of them coastal states that produce little oil, gas or coal and have transitioned more rapidly into the post-industrial economy of services and high-tech jobs, such as Massachusetts, New York, Virginia, and California. Representation in the House and Senate, and control of state governments, follow these same tracks, with Republicans dominating the high-emitting states and Democrats dominating those with lower emissions. Oil and gas companies now routinely direct about four-fifths of their campaign contributions toward Republicans in Congress. But the energy transition now underway is remaking this picture. Red places are among the clear winners in the emerging clean energy economy. Of the five states that produced the most wind-generated electricity in 2022, according to federal statistics, four are solidly red: Texas, Iowa, Oklahoma and Kansas; Illinois is the sole exception. Big solar generating states include Texas and Florida, as well as Arizona, Georgia and Nevada  places where Republicans control the state legislature, the governorship or both. The Inflation Reduction Act that passed last year on a party line vote is further diffusing these opportunities, though no Republican legislators in either the House or the Senate voted for it. Overall, as of March 31, companies have announced 191 new clean energy projects in small towns and bigger cities nationwide totaling $242.81 billion in new investments, according to a recent report by the environmental advocacy group Climate Power. Those investments are projected to create some 142,000 jobs, the group calculated. Of the 10 states that have received the most announced clean energy projects, the group found, only two are safely Democratic (New York and California.) The rest are either battleground states (Michigan, Arizona and Georgia) or Republican-leaning (Texas, Ohio, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee). The red tilt on investment is similarly pronounced at the congressional district level. In another study, Climate Power found that over half of all the new clean energy projects announced since the bills passage have been located in Republican-held congressional districts. The Republican district projects account, stunningly, for nearly four-fifths of the total clean energy investments that have been announced. The group found that two dozen House Republicans hold seats where clean energy companies have committed to investments of $1 billion or more since the passage of the IRA. The district that has received the most investment is held by New York Republican Rep. Brandon Williams (whose New York seat is the site of a massive plant that will manufacture semiconductors for EVs) and the district projected to receive the most jobs is held by Nevada Republican Rep. Mark Amodei (which has attracted four separate projects). A South Korean company is building a $2.5 billion solar panel manufacturing facility in the Georgia district of far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. Many reasons may explain why so much of the new clean energy investment has flowed into red places. Most important may be that Republican states and districts tilt more toward rural areas where space for large manufacturing facilities is easier to acquire. In those states, taxes are typically lower and state regulations more lenient as well. Some companies are also attracted to the non-union environment in most red states. Whatever the motivation for the companies, environmentalists have hoped that channeling more economic benefits from the energy transition into red places would soften the opposition of Republicans toward deemphasizing fossil fuels. The model some cite is how the spread of defense contracts across virtually every congressional district maximizes support for the Pentagon budget. Lori Lodes, executive director of Climate Power, sees that precedent as critical to sustaining a long-term federal effort behind promoting clean energy. What we need it to become is the defense authorization act, where every single congressional district has a piece of it  and it cant be undone and we are set on this path of reaching our goals because of how diffuse it is, she says. But establishing those political roots, she acknowledges, will take time, and in the near term, the torrent of new investment has not diminished Republican resistance. If anything, as Biden leans into measures to accelerate the energy transition, Republicans are stiffening their opposition. The harder one side pushes, the harder the other way the other side wants to push back, said Heather Reams, president of Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions, a conservative group that supports action on climate change. Last week, almost every House Republican voted for the sweeping bill to raise the debt ceiling that included the repeal of the extensive incentives in the IRA for both producers and consumers to shift to clean energy sources. Earlier this year, every House and Senate Republican, under an act allowing Congress to challenge federal regulations, voted to overturn a Department of Labor rule that would allow pension fund managers to consider so-called ESG (environmental, social and corporate governance) goals in making investment decisions  which is considered one important way to encourage more investment in green industries. Biden vetoed that change, but a coalition of Republican state attorneys general are still seeking to block the regulation in court. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a likely 2024 GOP presidential candidate, recently organized a coalition of 19 Republican governors to fight such ESG measures, which he derides as woke capitalism. West Virginias Republican Attorney General Patrick Morrisey has hinted that when the federal Environmental Protection Agency completes its proposed fuel economy regulations requiring a rapid shift toward electric vehicles, GOP AGs will sue to overturn that, too. No one would be surprised if such a coalition of Republican-controlled states sues as well to block the regulations the Biden EPA is developing to reduce carbon emissions from power plants. (Such a coalition successfully sued to block former President Barack Obamas regulations on the same topic.) And it seems inevitable that whenever the EPA completes both its fuel economy and power plant regulations that congressional Republicans will attempt to override them as well. From Republicans, predicts McNally, there will be complete and total opposition on all fronts to the coming Biden climate regulations. It will be kitchen sink  everything will be going at it. Reams is cautiously optimistic that if Republicans obtained unified control of the White House and Congress in 2025, they would preserve at least some of the IRAs clean energy incentives as part of an all of the above strategy to encourage more domestic production of both fossil fuels and low-carbon sources. But McNally, in a view shared from across the political spectrum by Lodes, predicts that if Republicans win unified control, they will gut the IRA clean energy incentives that they voted to eliminate last week. Ninety-eight percent of this is going to go, he says. When I reached out to several House Republicans last week to ask why they voted to rescind the IRA incentives although their districts have received big clean energy investments, most either did not respond or refused to comment. (In the latter camp was Utah Rep. John Curtis, who chairs the Conservative Climate Caucus and whose district has received $11 billion in clean energy investments, according to Climate Power.) One who did respond was Amodei, the Nevada Republican. He exemplifies the depth of Republican skepticism to the Democratic agenda to combat climate change. His northern Nevada district contains not only a massive (and expanding) Tesla plant, but also a factory being built by another battery company, Redwood Materials. Between them, the Redwood plant and Tesla expansion are expected to create 4,600 permanent manufacturing jobs as well as many construction jobs, according to news accounts. Yet Amodei voted last week to repeal all the IRAs incentives to encourage more production and consumption of electric vehicles. In an interview, he said the pace at which Biden and Democrats want to transition transportation toward EVs was unrealistic. Do I think electricity is the future? Absolutely, Amodei said. But he added, even with all these billions of dollars being poured into these things in the form of subsidies and penalties the rate at which Biden hopes to shift Americans into electric vehicles borders on suicidal. Moreover, he asserted that Nevada companies are largely being excluded from the construction jobs generated by the big plant expansions in his district, and that the bigger concern for most constituents he represents is the risk that the IRAs increased spending will fuel inflation. The benefits of the bill, he says, I dont think outweigh the negative stuff in terms of debt, inflation and oh, by the way, how much really came to Nevada? Amodei is one of the Republican members that Climate Power and the League of Conservation Voters have already targeted with ads criticizing their votes. Lodes says his claim that Nevada residents arent benefiting from the new jobs in his district just doesnt hold water. She says the groups challenge is to make clear to voters in the Republican districts benefiting from clean energy investments that their Representatives voted to repeal the incentives encouraging that spending. The case we will have to make to voters is that every single one of these MAGA extremists put their agenda ahead of their constituents, she says. That argument could prove effective in some swing districts, particularly those with a large number of college-educated voters. But most House Republicans represent solidly GOP-leaning areas. And demand for action against climate change has remained minimal inside the GOP coalition. Leiserowitz says that in Yales polling, only a very small percentage of even moderate Republicans cite climate as an important issue for government to address and that the share of all Republicans who support developing more clean energy sources is actually dropping. Republican voters are far more likely to say they support more domestic drilling for oil and gas. The vast majority of Republican voters even say they will never consider buying an electric vehicle, according to a recent Gallup poll. Democrats mostly take the opposite positions, placing far greater priority on climate change as a problem and expressing much more interest in changing not only public policy but also their personal behavior to combat it. Reams says that disparity has created a striking dynamic, with Republican-leaning communities producing the clean energy favored by Democratic-leaning consumers: You have a phenomenon of red supply for blue demand, she says. Like many environmentalists to her left, Reams believes that as the clean energy industries become more ingrained in GOP-leaning areas, more Republicans will say I cant repeal that. The historical behavior of members of Congress says shes right; but those precedents may no longer apply. Over time, more clean energy investments and jobs in Republican-leaning places should make the case for transition more compelling. Likewise, even in those red areas, more consumers may also experience benefits from renewable power sources or the cost savings of operating electric vehicles. Clean energy, electric vehicles, all the things associated with these things are going to become part of normal life in America, says Leiserowitz. The result is that people will ask, How can you be against something when everybody is doing it? But all these traditional dynamics could be offset if clean energy continues to get pulled into the rights culture war case against woke elites. Across a panoramic range of issues  from abortion, LGBTQ rights and guns to classroom censorship and book bans  Republicans, especially in red states, are looking to impose the cultural values of their predominantly conservative electoral coalition against what they consider liberal efforts to uproot the US from its traditions. So long as Republican voters are convinced to see the clean energy transition as part of that threat, even gleaming new factories and fat new paychecks may not much soften the partys sweeping resistance to climate action.",02/05/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/02/politics/green-investment-red-states-climate-crisis-fault-lines/index.html
"Find, gather and cook wild plants with urban forager Lisa M. Rose","Come spring, avid gardeners dig into the new growing season ready with careful cultivation plans they dreamed up over long winters. But even city-dwelling non-planners can benefit from year-round botanical bounty. They just need to learn what, where and how to harvest the wild foods growing in lawns, parks and scrubby backlots. Chickweed, dandelion and dock provide delicious, nutrient-rich greens, while daylilies, lilacs, honeysuckle and roses can add floral overtones to syrups, jellies and baked goods. Protein-packed wild plants and plant parts include purslane, acorns and brown dock seeds. Teas and tinctures made from ground ivy, gingko and golden rod, along with many other weeds and invasive species, can serve various medicinal purposes, once properly prepared. In her book Urban Foraging: Find, Gather, and Cook 50 Wild Plants, herbalist and expert forager Lisa M. Rose offers guidance on safely identifying, gathering and preparing edible flora that grow wild in most major US cities. Gathering your own food to make dinner can help instill a sense of place, she said. She maintains that highlighting the role of wild plants in our food system can teach us to heal our soil, our waterways and our own public health. In this way, urban foraging creates new potential for greener, healthier and more sustainable ecosystems. This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. CNN: What makes you so passionate about urban foraging? Lisa M. Rose: Oh my gosh, you can EAT those? pretty much sums up the thrill of urban foraging. Showing people all the edible plants that grow in cities helps connect them with the natural world. Its revolutionary to think differently of the unloved weeds and see opportunity in the neglected spaces that people pass by. The most fun, engaging thing is to get back outside and reconnect with the happiness that a dandelion flower can bring. Reinhabiting our 8-year-old, judgment-free selves allows us to recognize an elemental, earthly kind of beauty without the preconceived notions. Plus, wild plants have a unique function in the ecosystem. Even so-called invasive species can remediate the soil and water. They help to repair areas that have been leveled and left open to erosion by creating a structure that keeps the soil from blowing away. Soil is the building block of human health, and it needs a rich, diverse base of organic material to be able to give us nutritious food. CNN: What safety precautions do you recommend for people foraging in cities? Rose: My family is from Flint, Michigan. I take soil and water contamination issues very seriously. The first steps to safe urban foraging are knowing where to harvest  including researching the history of the land, if possible  and learning which plants and plant parts may be more likely to contain contaminants like heavy metals or pollutants. Nettles, for example, are apt to take up heavy metals like lead. So, I recommend harvesting these only from places free of soil contamination. The key is to take caution and be judicious. But remember, given the realities of our industrialized food system, the plants available at a commercial supermarket often have layers of pesticides. We dont live in a perfect world. Also, it sounds silly, but when it comes to plants or mushrooms, if you dont know what it is, dont pick it, and definitely dont put it in your mouth! CNN: What does it mean to forage responsibly? How can we take from while taking care of the land? Rose: As you observe an environment and learn what plants could be edible, make the effort to learn further: Is this endangered? Threatened? An invasive species? We want to consider, ethically, the plants distribution and the habitat. I rarely feel badly when I pick my garlic mustard. Its going to come back. But when it comes to foraging by greengrocers and restaurants, its important to consider that theres only so much the ecosystems can offer at that retail level. Where are these items coming from? How do I ensure no habitat destruction happens under the name of foraging trends? We have a long way to go in creating regionally based food systems that would help all of us, including our restaurants and grocers. CNN: How do community health and food justice concerns fit into foraging? Rose: Its impossible to decouple social justice from human health. Food-system inequities have a massive impact on access to nutrients and effects on human health. About 10% of the US population faces food insecurity  a wicked problem that foraging, gardening and local food systems cannot solve alone. But, restoring foodways  even simply refining how to cook basic things  can play a powerful part in increasing food access. Urban foraging is an effort to democratize the wild plants to make them more available to more people. You dont have to be classically trained as a botanist at university. These are basic human skills. CNN: How much could we rely on urban foraging to feed ourselves? Rose: Not significantly, given the current populations and designs of our cities. Its inconceivable and unethical for me to suggest that all of Manhattan go and use Central Park as their greengrocer. But intentionally designing more green space can create the possibility for more available food for city communities within a smaller footprint. CNN: Can you forage year-round? Rose: Yes! Harvesting must be done in context of your growing zone, of course, but part of the endeavor is to recognize what your landscape can provide. Even on frigid January and February days, foragers can find bark, buds and sap. Consider how, for millennia, indigenous communities supported a basic diet with fresh and stored wild foods. In many traditions, for example, acorns  high in carbohydrates and protein  played a significant role in helping to extend harvests to provide food for the winter. Acorns are a quintessential foragers food that can be used in soups, pulverized into a nut butter or ground into flour for baking. Every fall, I process enough acorns to make 10 to 15 pounds of flour, with the help of neighbors who drop off bags full or team up to shell them while we chat over cocktails and cheese. Later, we share the acorn bread I bake, which is kind of my signature. Recipe: Acorn Bread Makes 1 loaf Ingredients Instructions Prepare the flour Bake the bread CNN: How does the climate crisis factor into urban foraging? Rose: Weve arrived at a big crossroads. At no other time has our human population had to face and address a rapidly changing climate across the globe. This affects our water systems, our food systems, even determining where we can live  as evidenced by migrations of people moving away from the shores of lakes and oceans. Urban foraging for wild plants helps us rethink how we live alongside the natural world, looking at habitat loss. We can learn a lot simply by honing our ability to observe the little dandelion or the patch of cattails along the riverside. How might we add back our green spaces that can build soil, support the biodiversity that we need and bring forward our pollinators? You cant be what you dont see. If you dont have a connection to the water, a farmers market, a vegetable garden or to considering what that dandelion might be doing in the soil, how could you ever become a climate-conscious Earth protector, a steward of the ecosystem? Foraging helps us pay closer attention, which helps us to reestablish a more caring and less extractive relationship with the natural world.",02/05/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/02/health/urban-foraging-wellness-scn/index.html
"COP28 president says fossil fuels still have a role to play, prompting concerns about climate summit? goals","The president of the UNs COP28 climate conference has said that he sees a future for fossil fuels  even as scientists say the world must rapidly transition to clean energy  in remarks that have raised concerns about a backsliding on climate commitments. Sultan Al Jaber, who will oversee the UNs COP28 climate summit in Dubai in November, called for a focus on technologies to capture the planet-heating pollution produced by coal, oil and gas. We know that fossil fuels will continue to play a role in the foreseeable future in helping meet global energy requirements, said Al Jaber, speaking on Wednesday at the Petersberg Climate Dialogue in Berlin, a conference attended by representatives from around 40 countries to help set the agenda for COP28. He said that the world needed to come to terms with some realities and embrace an energy transition that includes all sources of energy. Our aim should be focused on ensuring that we phase out emissions from all sectors, added Al Jaber. Its a departure from what other countries have called for. In March, European countries agreed to promote a global phase-out of fossil fuels in a text setting out their priorities for COP28. The shift towards a climate neutral economy will require the global phase-out of unabated fossil fuels, the text said. More than 80 countries supported a commitment to phase out oil, coal and gas at COP27 in Egypt last year, but Saudi Arabia and other oil and gas producing nations opposed it. Tasneem Essop, the executive director of Climate Action Network, an alliance of environmental groups, told CNN that it was concerning that Al Jaber was speaking about a foreseeable future for fossil fuels and a phase out of emissions. A plan to end the era of fossil fuels should be central to the discussions and outcomes from COP28, she said. Nils Bartsch, head of oil and gas research at the German non-profit Urgewald, told CNN the world faces an absolute carbon budget for 1.5 degrees Celsius. Reducing emissions intensity of oil and gas production does not change that  it just helps to exhaust our budget a little slower. Scientists have said that the world should make every effort to stay under 1.5 degrees of global warming above pre-industrial levels, and nations have been working to keep that goal within reach at the annual climate summits. Al Jaber emphasized the role of technologies like carbon capture in reducing planet-heating pollution. However, some experts are concerned that these technologies remain prohibitively expensive, are unproven at scale and would take too long to implement, given the urgency of the climate crisis. We cannot pretend the solutions to the climate crisis lie with unreliable, untested techno fixes that will bring new risks and threats, Essop told CNN. Al Jaber was a controversial pick to oversee COP28. He is also CEO of the state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, one of the worlds biggest oil and gas producers. Some, however, welcomed Al Jabers appointment. US climate envoy John Kerry told Associated Press that he was a terrific choice, citing his commitment to expanding renewable energy. Al Jaber used the Berlin conference to set out priorities, including tripling renewable energy by 2030, doubling hydrogen production, expanding nuclear power and improving battery storage. He also called on rich countries to deliver on their funding promises to climate-vulnerable countries. In 2009, wealthy nations pledged to mobilize $100 billion in annual climate funding, but they have consistently fallen far short of that target. Al Jaber said this failure to deliver is hindering progress and undermining trust. He asked countries to supercharge climate finance. What I hear time and again is that climate finance is simply not available, not accessible, and not affordable, Al Jaber said in Berlin on Tuesday. If the world doesnt come up with effective mechanisms to deliver climate finance to developing and emerging economies, they will have no choice but to choose a carbon-intensive development path. This years COP28 is considered particularly significant because it will include the first global stocktake, which will evaluate countries progress towards climate targets. All indicators... are telling us that we are way off track, said Al Jaber. Germanys foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, also speaking at the Berlin conference on Wednesday, said it will be important that we actually take stock of what we have achieved and the targets we set ourselves. We have to get out of fossil fuels, we have to dramatically reduce emissions. it is no longer about visions. It is finally about delivering on the pledges we made, she said.",03/05/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/03/world/berlin-climate-conference-cop28-fossil-fuels-intl/index.html
New York becomes the first state to ban natural gas stoves and furnaces in most new buildings,"New York is the first state in the country to ban natural gas and other fossil fuels in most new buildings  a major win for climate advocates, but a move that could spark pushback from fossil fuel interests. Facing mounting pressure from environmental advocates and climate-minded voters, Gov. Kathy Hochul and Democratic lawmakers, who control the New York Senate and Assembly, approved the new $229 billion state budget containing the provision late Tuesday night. The law bans gas-powered stoves, furnaces and propane heating and effectively encourages the use of climate-friendly appliances such as heat pumps and induction stoves in most new residential buildings across the state. It requires all-electric heating and cooking in new buildings shorter than seven stories by 2026, and for taller buildings by 2029. The states budget doesnt ban gas in all new buildings  there are exceptions for large commercial and industrial buildings like stores, hospitals, laundromats, and restaurants, for instance. But the impact on new residential buildings could be significant. Buildings account for 32% of New York States planet-warming emissions, according to a 2022 report. Methane, the main component of natural gas used to fuel stoves and heat homes, has more than 80 times as much warming power as carbon dioxide in the first two decades its in the atmosphere. For that reason, scientists have narrowed in on the fossil fuel as a way to rapidly decrease planet-warming pollution. Several studies also have found that gas stoves are responsible for severe health conditions, including asthma. The laws passage comes after a federal officials comments on gas stoves sparked controversy earlier this year. Richard Trumka Jr., a US Consumer Product Safety commissioner, set off a firestorm when he said in January that gas stoves were a significant source of indoor pollution linked to childhood asthma, and suggested that the agency could be working to ban them in new homes. Trumka later clarified his statement, saying the agency is not looking to go into anyones homes and take away items that are already there. While New York is the first state to pass such a law, other cities have led the way. In 2019, Berkeley became the first US city to pass a code banning natural gas hookups in new buildings. Other cities, including San Francisco in 2020 and New York City in 2021, quickly followed suit. But other municipalities looking to take similar action have run into brick walls. More than a dozen states with GOP-controlled legislatures have passed so-called preemption laws that prohibit cities from banning natural gas. In a statement, Hochul spokesperson Katy Zielinski said the new budget will protect our families and our residents, while putting New York on trajectory to a cleaner, healthier future. Alex Beauchamp, the northeast region director at Food & Water Watch, an environment non-profit that focuses on food and water issues, called the deal a historic step, but said the state is moving too slowly on climate action. New Yorkers are resisting fossil fuels everywhere they pop up, from the power plants that pollute our air to the pipelines that put our communities in harms way. Now buildings can be a part of that solution, Beauchamp said. We wont stop fighting until we end our devastating addiction to fossil fuels. The natural gas industry pushed back on the states new law, characterizing it as taking away choices for consumers. Any push to ban natural gas would raise costs to consumers, jeopardize environmental progress and deny affordable energy to underserved populations, American Gas Association president and CEO Karen Harbert said in a statement. One legal expert who follows natural gas bans told CNN that while New Yorks ban is potentially a very big deal, it could face legal challenges. I do wonder how these legal fights are going to play out over this, said Sarah Fox, an associate law professor at Northern Illinois University School of Law. Fox noted that the California Restaurant Association successfully challenged the city of Berkeleys ban on gas stoves. (New Yorks law carves out an exception for restaurants.) But the fact that New York wields the power of a state could have an impact on legal repercussions, Fox added. I think its huge that a state is doing it, not only because New York is a big-impact state, Fox said. It takes it outside of this narrative of these are these fringe cities passing these policies. This is becoming a mainstream policy that a state like New York is taking on. Fox noted that even with a conservative Supreme Court, this could ultimately be seen as being the purview of a states right to pass its own laws. I think were going to learn in the coming months about how strategic you have to be about where those legal problems are going to present themselves, Fox said. In addition to banning natural gas, New Yorks budget deal pushes other climate change efforts, including creating publicly owned renewable energy projects that would create green jobs as well as a cap-and-invest program that would make companies with a higher carbon footprint purchase permits to pollute. The revenue the cap-and-invest program raises would go toward initiatives that offset the impact of planet-warming pollution. Its been three years since New York implemented its landmark climate law, the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, that commits the state to net-zero emissions by 2050. But each year, the state adds roughly 250,000 metric tons of planet-warming pollution from the tens of thousands of new homes and buildings that are built with gas installations, according to an analysis by the Rocky Mountain Institute, a non-profit organization that advocates for the transition to clean energy. Zielinski also noted the New York Power Authority is working on plans to decarbonize 15 state facilities with the most greenhouse gas emissions. The plans will accelerate our progress towards a cleaner building sector, support the creation of high-quality jobs at future decarbonization projects including thermal energy networks, and move the State closer to reaching our climate goals, Zielinski said in a statement.

Autoworkers union holding off endorsing Biden,"The powerful United Auto Workers is holding off on endorsing President Joe Bidens reelection bid, citing concerns over his policies that would encourage a transition to electric vehicles, according to a memo from the union. Biden, who has termed himself the most pro-union president in history, has already received the backing of some unions, including Service Employees International Union and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. His first stop after announcing his reelection campaign last week was to a union conference in Washington. But the Detroit-based UAW is stopping short of backing the president, whom it endorsed in 2020, as Biden works to enact policies meant to combat climate change, including encouraging the manufacture of electric vehicles. The United Auto Workers is not yet making an endorsement, the groups president Shawn Fain wrote in a memo to members. The UAW has more than 400,000 members, and Biden has touted its support in the past. Last year he called American autoworkers the most skilled autoworkers in the world. The groups membership is mostly concentrated in Michigan, a presidential election battleground. Leaders from the group met in Washington last week with top Biden administration officials to voice their concerns over the electronic vehicle policies. Biden has endorsed policies meant to significantly transition the nations autos to electric, including rules from the EPA that would ensure two-thirds of new cars sold in the United States are electric by 2032. The transition is meant to curb emissions that are a leading cause of climate change. But autoworkers are expressing concern the transition could leave them out. Electronic vehicles are easier to make in large part because they have fewer components. Internal combustion vehicles and their powertrains  the mechanics that convert gasoline to energy and propel the vehicles  have far more individual components to assemble. Electronic vehicles are powered by batteries and use energy more efficiently, according to a Department of Energy analysis. The federal government is pouring billions into the electric vehicle transition, with no strings attached and no commitment to workers, Fain wrote in the memo. The EV transition is at serious risk of becoming a race to the bottom. We want to see national leadership have our back on this before we make any commitments. The UAW has traditionally supported Democrats, and Fain writes in his memo that Another Donald Trump presidency would be a disaster. Still, the memo says UAW members need to see an alternative that delivers real results. We need to get our members organized behind a pro-worker, pro-climate, and pro-democracy political program that can deliver for the working class, the memo reads. Biden has long relied on the political support of unions, and earlier Wednesday his campaign released a television ad leaning into his economic record. The 60-second ad titled Backbone strikes a populist tone, mixing audio of the president speaking about investing in places and people that have been forgotten and a narrator ticking through the administrations work to boost infrastructure and manufacturing in the country. Joe Bidens building an economy that leaves no city, no town, no American behind, the narrator says. This ad is part of the seven-figure ad campaign in six battleground states announced last week. The campaign has also expanded their buy into two new states  Florida and North Carolina  which Biden lost during the 2020 campaign. This story has been updated with additional developments.",03/05/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/03/politics/autoworkers-union-holding-off-endorsing-biden/index.html
Indian American businessman Ajay Banga is the new president of the World Bank,"The World Banks board of governors on Wednesday elected former Mastercard CEO Ajay Banga to a five-year term as president, ushering in an Indian-born finance and development expert to revamp the lender to tackle climate change and other global crises. Banga, 63, was nominated for the post by US President Joe Biden in late February and was the sole contender to replace departing World Bank chief David Malpass, an economist and former US Treasury official who served in the Trump administration. He starts the new job on June 2. The election came after World Bank board members interviewed Banga for four hours on Monday. Malpasss last day at the bank will be June 1. The decision came in a vote by 24 of the boards members, with Russia abstaining, instead of the usual consensus-based process, a source familiar with the process said. Biden congratulated Banga on his resounding approval to run the World Bank, which he described as one of humanitys most critical institutions to reduce poverty and expand prosperity around the globe. Ajay Banga will be a transformative leader, bringing expertise, experience, and innovation to the position of World Bank President, Biden said. He will help steer the institution as it evolves and expands to address global challenges that directly affect its core mission of poverty reduction  including climate change. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Banga brought the right leadership and management skills to the job, and would play a critical role in pushing forward with additional reforms, including by forging partnerships between the public and private sectors and nonprofit groups. Ajay understands that the challenges we face  from combatting climate change, pandemics, and fragility to eliminating extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity  are deeply intertwined. He has effectively built a broad global coalition around his vision for the Bank over the course of his candidacy, Yellen said in a statement. Katie Malouf-Bous, interim head of Oxfam Internationals Washington office, said the bank needed serious reform to tackle the widening gap between rich and poor, but that would require huge new public investments and guardrails around private finance that has run riot for too long. One senior US official said Bangas election came at a critical moment marked by emerging debt distress in lower- and middle-income countries and ongoing problems in food and energy markets as a result of Russias war in Ukraine. It is a challenging moment, but its a moment where the World Bank remains more vital than ever, and where getting the evolution of the World Bank is absolutely critical, the official said. The bank already loans out hundreds of billions of dollars to developing countries but is working to increase its lending to help them address overlapping global challenges such as climate change, conflict and brace for future pandemics. The Board looks forward to working with Mr. Banga on the World Bank Group Evolution process ... on all the World Bank Groups ambitions and efforts aimed at tackling the toughest development challenges facing developing countries, the bank said. The World Bank has been led by an American since its founding at the end of World War Two, while the International Monetary Fund has been led by a European. Banga, who was born in India and spent his early career there, has been a US citizen since 2007. Banga has met with officials from 96 governments since his nomination, the source said. He visited eight countries during a three-week world tour to meet with government officials, business leaders and civil society groups, flying a total of 39,546 miles (63,643 km)",04/05/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/03/business/us-india-world-bank-president-hnk-intl/index.html
WHO says Covid-19 is no longer a global health emergency,"Covid-19 is no longer a global health emergency, the World Health Organization said on Friday. WHOs International Health Regulations Emergency Committee discussed the pandemic on Thursday at its 15th meeting on Covid-19, and WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus concurred that the public health emergency of international concern, or PHEIC, declaration should end. For more than a year the pandemic has been on a downward trend, Tedros said at a news conference Friday. This trend has allowed most countries to return to life as we knew it before Covid-19, Tedros said. Yesterday, the emergency committee met for the 15th time and recommended to me that I declare an end to the public health emergency of international concern. I have accepted that advice. The organization declared the coronavirus outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern in January 2020, about six weeks before characterizing it as a pandemic. A PHEIC creates an agreement between countries to abide by WHOs recommendations for managing the emergency. Each country, in turn, declares its own public health emergency  declarations that carry legal weight. Countries use them to marshal resources and waive rules in order to ease a crisis. The United States is set to let its Covid-19 public health emergency end on May 11. Covid-19 continues to spread, the virus is evolving and remains a global health threat, but at a lower level of concern, according to WHO officials. Theres still a public health threat out there, and we all see that every day in terms of the evolution of this virus, in terms of its global presence, its continued evolution and continued vulnerabilities in our communities, both societal vulnerabilities, age vulnerabilities, protection vulnerabilities, and many other things, said Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of WHOs Health Emergencies Programme. So, we fully expect that this virus will continue to transmit, but this is the history of pandemics, Ryan said. In most cases, pandemics truly end when the next pandemic begins. I know thats a terrible thought but that is the history of pandemics. Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, WHOs Covid-19 technical lead and head of its program on emerging disease, said that the emergency phase of the Covid-19 crisis is over but the disease is here to stay and the coronavirus that causes the disease is not going away any time soon. While were not in the crisis mode, we cant let our guard down, Van Kerkhove said. Epidemiologically, this virus will continue to cause waves. What we are hopeful of is that we have the tools in place to ensure that the future waves do not result in more severe disease, dont result in waves of death and we can do that with the tools we have at hand. We just need to make sure that we are tracking the virus because it will continue to evolve. There have been more than 765 million confirmed Covid-19 cases since the start of the pandemic, according to WHO data. Nearly 7 million people have died. Europe has had the most confirmed cases overall, but the Americas have reported the most deaths. About 1 in 6 total deaths have been in the US. Cases peaked in December 2022 as Omicron swept the globe, hitting the Western Pacific particularly hard. But billions of vaccine doses have been administered globally, and deaths have remained far below previous peaks. Now, Covid-19 cases and deaths are about the lowest theyve been in three years. Still, more than 3,500 people died in the last week of April and billions remain unvaccinated. Tedros said that, if needed, he would not hesitate to convene another emergency committee meeting and declare a global health emergency again if there is a significant rise in Covid-19 cases or deaths in the future. Covid-19 has left and continues to leave deep scars on our world. Those scars must serve as a permanent reminder of the potential for new viruses to emerge with devastating consequences, Tedros said. One of the greatest tragedies of Covid-19 is that it didnt have to be this way. We have the tools and technologies to prepare for pandemics better, detect them earlier, respond to them faster, and communicate their impact. But globally, a lack of coordination, a lack of equity, and lack of solidarity meant that those tools were not used as effectively as they could have been, Tedros said. We must promise ourselves and our children and grandchildren that we will never make those mistakes again.",05/05/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/05/health/who-ends-covid-health-emergency/index.html
"Ocean temperatures are off the charts right now, and scientists are alarmed","Ocean surface heat is at record-breaking levels. Temperatures began climbing in mid-March and skyrocketed over the course of several weeks, leaving scientists scrambling to figure out exactly why. Temperatures have fallen since their peak in April  as they naturally do in the spring  but they are still higher than they have ever been on record for this time of year. It is remarkable, said Gregory C. Johnson, an oceanographer at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which calculates the ocean surface temperature using a network of ships, buoys, satellites and floats. Although its still preliminary data, if it holds up, he said, this is another milestone. The record may not seem huge  its nearly two-tenths of a degree higher than the previous record in 2016  but given how much heat is needed to warm up this huge body of water, its a massive amount of energy, Matthew England, professor of ocean and climate dynamics at the University of New South Wales, Australia, told CNN. Whats behind this rapid increase isnt totally clear yet. These temperatures just rocketed up, people havent had a chance to puzzle it all out, Johnson said. Some scientists are concerned the scale of these new records could mark the start of an alarming trend. Others say record-breaking temperatures like these are always concerning but to be expected given the human-caused climate crisis. All agree the consequences are likely to be significant. Warmer oceans bleach coral, kill marine life, increase sea level rise and make the ocean less efficient at absorbing planet-warming pollution  the warmer oceans get, the more the planet will heat. One major driver of the heat is believed to be an approaching  and potentially strong  El Nino, a natural climate fluctuation associated with warming in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, which has a global heating effect. The world has just emerged from a 3-year La Nina, El Ninos cooler counterpart, which has helped mask the full impact of global warming. Since La Nina ended in March, ocean temperatures seem to be on a rebound, scientists say. Its a little bit like weve had the freezer door open for a while and its helped to cool the planet, Johnson said. But even while that freezer has been open, background temperatures have continued to rise. Now the freezer is closed, everything is hotter than before. The World Meteorological Organization said on Wednesday there is about an 80% chance El Nino will develop between July and September. But part of what has puzzled scientists is temperatures have risen so much before it has even arrived. Some are concerned this suggests climate change might be progressing in ways climate models have not predicted. An El Nino event is brewing, but its probably too early to blame that as the cause, professor Mike Meredith, science leader at the British Antarctic Survey, told CNN. Its vital that we find out what is causing [the peak in ocean surface temperature] though, and understand whether this is an isolated extreme high or the start of an even more worrying trend. Surface temperatures tell one story about whats happening to the worlds oceans. But to understand where the world is heading in the long term, its important to also look at the deeper ocean temperatures, said Sarah Purkey, an assistant professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Thousands of floats in the worlds oceans measure its heat content, analyzing temperature from the surface down to the deep waters, feeding back data. Ocean heat content has been on a very steady, sometimes accelerating, rise, Purkey told CNN, because of human-caused global warming. The oceans absorb around 90% of the excess heat the world produces, as well as around 25% of carbon pollution. In 2022, the oceans were the warmest on record for the fourth year in a row. A study published in April found the heat in the climate system was accelerating, spelling bad news for the oceans. It found the rate of change in how much heat the Earth has accumulated has more than doubled over the last two decades  and most of that is going into the ocean. Theres a really urgent need to understand this because if its part of a long term trend, this is really highly concerning, said Karina von Schuckmann, an oceanographer at Mercator Ocean International in France and a co-author on the study. One surprising reason could be the reduction of aerosols in the atmosphere. In 2020, regulations were introduced to limit the amount of sulfur in the fuel ships used  a policy aimed at addressing air pollution. Though air pollution has a significant impact on human health, it also acts as an artificial sunscreen and reflects sunlight away from the Earth. One theory is the absence of aerosols may have turned up the heat, von Schuckmann said. Whatever the reasons behind the increase in ocean heat, the impacts are potentially catastrophic if temperatures continue to head off the charts. The oceans shield us from the full impacts of the climate crisis. We should thank the ocean for taking up most of what weve done to the climate system, otherwise we would be seeing effects that are really 100 times what were seeing right now, Purkey said. But this buffering role comes at a high cost. Hotter oceans cause coral reef bleaching and are linked to toxic algae blooms, which can suck oxygen from the water and choke marine life, sometimes forcing fisheries to close. Warmer waters are also less effective at absorbing carbon, which means more is left in the atmosphere, which in turn fuels more global warming. Sea level rises as water warms  not only through the melting of ice sheets, but water also expands as it heats up. Surface warming supercharges cyclones and hurricanes. Scientists are particularly concerned about the impact of warming on meridional overturning currents, ocean conveyor belts that push surface water to the deeper ocean and play a key role in regulating the planets energy balance. Its probably the most important thing to monitor, said Purkey. The strength of the currents will determine how efficient the ocean is at taking up the excess heat humans are producing, she said. And, for example, if the overturning current in the Atlantic Ocean weakens, or even collapses, the consequences could be dire  including very cold winters in Western Europe, rapid sea level rise and disruption to tropical monsoons. For now, ocean surface temperatures have started to fall, even if they remain high for this time of year. As scientists continue to analyze the reasons for record ocean warming, they are clear records will continue to be smashed as the climate crisis intensifies. This is a bit of a wake-up call, I hope, for everybody globally that this trajectory of warming that were on is not going to stop until we bring our emissions right back down to zero, England said.",05/05/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/05/world/ocean-surface-temperature-heat-record-climate-intl/index.html
"Church of England changes wording of public declaration in King Charles III? coronation, following backlash","The Church of England has changed the wording of its invitation to the public to pledge allegiance to King Charles during his coronation, following a public backlash. In a break with coronation tradition, British and Commonwealth citizens around the globe had initially been invited to recite a pledge of allegiance to the new monarch and his heirs and successors. The Archbishop of Canterbury, who authorized the new liturgy, presented the plans to involve the public in the ceremony as a democratic initiative. But, following public criticism, the archbishop will now give people the option of saying just God save King Charles, rather than making the full pledge of allegiance. According to a revised text of the liturgy for the coronation service, published Saturday by Lambeth Palace, the archbishop will say: I now invite those who wish to offer their support to do so, with a moment of private reflection, by joining in saying God save King Charles at the end, or, for those with the words before them, to recite them in full. The full pledge reads: I swear that I will pay true allegiance to Your Majesty, and to your heirs and successors according to law. So help me God. In a previous version of the text, published in April, the archbishop was to call upon all persons of goodwill in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and of the other realms and the territories to make their homage, in heart and voice, to their undoubted king, defender of all. The earlier version had been described as ill-advised by Jonathan Dimbleby, a veteran broadcaster and prominent friend of the King. I can think of nothing that he would find more abhorrent. Hes never wanted to be revered. Hes never wanted, so far as I know, to have anyone pay homage to him except in mock terms as a joke, Dimbleby told BBC Radio 4s Today program on Friday.

Sudan? warring military factions to meet face-to-face for first time since conflict began,"The rival military factions fighting for control in Sudan are to hold face-to-face talks for the first time since fighting began last month. The meeting between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) is aimed at ending the unrest and will take place in the Saudi city of Jeddah, according to Saudi Arabia and the United States. Clashes began on April 15 and since then a series of truces have collapsed. Saudi Arabia and the US have welcomed the start of the pre-negotiation discussions, to take place on Saturday, and called on both factions to actively engage in the talks towards a ceasefire and end to the conflict. (We) urge both parties to take in consideration the interests of the Sudanese nation and its people, the two countries said in a press release on Friday. Since the fighting started, hundreds have been killed and thousands more injured. According to data from UNICEF (United Nations Childrens Fund) released on Friday, at least 190 children have been killed and 1,700 others injured in the fighting. A tentative ceasefire is currently allowing foreign nations to evacuate their citizens  but locals face deteriorating conditions and shortages of food, water, medicine and fuel. Meanwhile, people on the ground in the country have told CNN that RSF fighters are trying to take control of strategically located hospitals that can be used as bases for the paramilitary force. The RSF has already fully taken over Omdurman Maternity Hospital, a senior medical employee at a hospital in the state of Khartoum told CNN. The source, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retribution, told CNN he had confirmed this by speaking with several staff members at the hospital. He said the RSF was targeting hospitals because it needed cover from air strikes, especially after their main military bases were completely destroyed by the army in the first few days of the war. During the past days, they (have) controlled the maternity hospital in Omdurman. It is the biggest obstetrics and gynecology hospital in the whole country. (The RSF have parked) many of their vehicles inside the hospital yard. It will provide them with a very good cover ... It will be impossible for the army (SAF) to strike it by air because the surrounding area is full of civilians, it is in the middle of three big neighborhoods. A second medical source, who works at a different hospital in Khartoum and who also wishes to remain anonymous, confirmed the RSF had taken over the Omdurman Maternity Hospital. CNN has been unable to contact the hospital due to network connectivity issues in Sudan. However, it has obtained a widely circulated statement reportedly issued by the Omdurman Maternity Hospital administration that says the hospital was attacked at dawn on Thursday by RSF forces. They managed to break into the hospital and steal from the exchange counter about 20 million Sudanese pounds, including the deposits (of patients) according to the financial statements of the counter. They also kicked the workers out of the hospital so that the hospital became completely under their full control, and their vehicles entered the hospital (area), the statement reads. CNN has not independently verified these claims, nor has CNN been able to reach the paramilitary RSF for their comments. Omdurman is Sudans most populated city, located less than hour northwest of the center of the capital and often referred to as Khartoums twin city. A manager at another hospital in Khartoum voiced concerns over the spread of gangs throughout the two cities. These gangs are becoming more aggressive, robbing banks and markets, and destroying shops. They have already stolen a large amount of money from the Khartoum Bank. There is a complete absence of police, and the army is not able to secure many routes, the manager said.",06/05/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/06/world/sudan-conflict-talks-saudi-arabia-intl-hnk/index.html
Loaf-size mission launches to improve hurricane forecasting,"A new mission designed to improve hurricane forecasting has launched, just ahead of the June 1 arrival of the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season. The NASA mission includes a constellation of CubeSats called TROPICS, or Time-Resolved Observations of Precipitation structure and storm Intensity with a Constellation of Smallsats. The first two CubeSats lifted off from Mahia, New Zealand, aboard a Rocket Lab Electron rocket at 9 p.m. ET on Sunday. The first mission was nicknamed Rocket Like a Hurricane, while two additional CubeSats, nicknamed Coming to a Storm Near You, will launch from the same location in about two weeks. Together, the four satellites, each weighing 12 pounds and about the size of a loaf of bread, will observe tropical cyclones from low-Earth orbit. Once all of them are in orbit, the tiny satellites will form a constellation that makes more frequent observations than current weather-monitoring satellites. The need for improved climate and weather data from space is acute and growing. Hurricanes and tropical storms have a devastating effect on lives and livelihoods, so were immensely proud to be entrusted by NASA to launch the TROPICS missions which will enable scientists and researchers to accurately predict storm strength and give people time to evacuate and make plans, said Rocket Lab founder and CEO Peter Beck in a statement. With the 2023 hurricane season fast approaching, time is of the essence for these missions. Each CubeSat will orbit at about 340 miles (550 kilometers) above Earths surface and capture hourly observations of the precipitation, temperature and humidity of tropical storms. Current satellites take similar data, but only about every six hours, which makes it more difficult to measure the intensity of storms. More frequent data can help scientists understand the rapid changes that can occur within a storm, impacting its structure and stability, and help meteorologists improve their prediction and forecasting models. During the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, there were so many tropical storms and hurricanes that meteorologists ran out of names on the predefined list and had to switch to the Greek alphabet  and then the same thing happened again in 2021, said Ben Kim, program executive at NASAs Earth Science Division. In 2022, three hurricanes hit the US, but Hurricane Ian alone caused more than $100 billion in damages and caused more than 100 fatalities, Kim said. TROPICS aims to improve our scientific understanding by obtaining microwave observations that allow us to see the inner structure of the storm approximately hourly, Kim said. These observations will complement existing weather satellites and ultimately then can be tied to the broader understanding of the entire Earth system. Data collected by TROPICS will be shared with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, the National Hurricane Center and other partners. The satellites will measure water vapor primarily located in the troposphere, or the lowest layer of Earths atmosphere, where most weather phenomena occurs. The exciting thing about this is its the ability to see inside the storms, but its also the ability to see how the storms are changing over short periods of time, said Dr. Will McCarty, program scientist at NASAs Earth Science Division.",07/05/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/07/world/nasa-tropics-mission-launch-scn/index.html
Climate activists dye iconic Italian fountain water black,"A group of climate activists in Italy have poured what they described as a charcoal-based black liquid into the water of Romes famous Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi (Fountain of the Four Rivers)  to sound the alarm about the black future that awaits humanity. Our future is as black as this water, the group called Ultima Generazione, or Last Generation, said on their website. Without water, there is no life and with rising temperatures, we are exposed to drought on the one hand and floods on the other, they added. Difficult years await us but if we dont reach zero emissions immediately they will be terrible. Photos showed activists, wearing orange vests, standing waist deep in the fountain. They unfolded orange banners bearing the words in Italian: Our future is as black as this water as crowds of onlookers snapped pictures. It is believed to be the same group of climate activists that led protests at other Italian historical sites including the Barcaccia fountain at the base of the Spanish Steps in central Rome, where they poured black liquid into the fountain on April 1. Similar protests saw activists glue themselves to Italian art masterpieces in locations like the Vatican museums and Uffizi galleries in Florence. It is absurd that this gesture should shock you when we are experiencing a drought emergency that is putting agriculture, energy production in crisis, the group said of its protest then. Members of the group were arrested by police and are facing charges of defacing a public monument. Located in the famed Piazza Navona square in Rome, the Fiumi Fountain was designed by Italian sculptor Gian Lorenzo Bernini in 1651. Italys Minister of Culture Gennaro Sangiuliano condemned the activists protest and said those responsible must pay out of their own pockets. We have to record yet another defacement that endangers the beauty of one of our nations iconic works of art, Sangiuliano said. As I have explained many times, these are acts against the environment which they claim to want to defend because the notion of landscape includes what beautiful things over centuries of history human genius has produced, he added. Experts talk about anthropization of the environment. Now again, a lot of water will have to be used to clean up and costs incurred to restore the state of the monument  and (paying for it) will be Italian citizens. Describing the group as eco-vandals, Sangiuliano said: I hope Parliament will approve new regulations against them as soon as possible.",07/05/2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/07/europe/italy-climate-protesters-dye-rome-fountain-black-intl-hnk/index.html
